"football florian wirtz\'s goal for bayer leverkusen in the europa league represents the next step on the road to recovery for the german teenager; adam bate was in the bayarena to see it and discuss the player\'s vast potential with sporting director simon rolfes @ghostgoal it was the moment that florian wirtz had been waiting for, the moment that the bayarena had been waiting for, and when it came it was special. the first goal for bayer leverkusen's wunderkind since his long-term knee injury lit up their game against monaco. wirtz touched the ball nine times in scoring it. ten if you included the toe-poked volley to team-mate exequiel palacios in the build-up. but those nine touches - the ball never moving more than a metre from his boot until the finish - showed why he is so special. that quick shift of the ball from one foot to the other had been seen minutes earlier when his previous dribble had been the catalyst for moussa diaby\'s equaliser. there is a calmness to his game, an ability to glide without breaking stride, that only the best possess. it felt cruel on wirtz that it was not the winner. two late goals for monaco made it a - win for them in the first leg of this europa league play-off round. a blow to supporters, but for the wider game, the latest step on wirtz\'s journey back is the bigger story. speaking to leverkusen sporting director simon rolfes in the offices at the stadium, it is put to him that perhaps english audiences do not know too much about wirtz\'s wonderful talent just yet. he laughs. ""you will do,"" rolfes tells sky sports. you sense he is right. at , wirtz is the great hope of german football. the excitement about his return to fitness extends far beyond his own club - a point illustrated by the wide smile on the face of national team coach hansi flick, celebrating alongside rudi voller in the stands. badly missed at the world cup, most expect him to be the poster boy for euro . but an anterior cruciate ligament injury is the sort of setback that stifles careers, even for one precocious enough to make his bundesliga debut weeks after turning . transfer centre live! bundesliga table football features download the sky sports app he adapted quickly, scoring against bayern munich in only his fourth appearance and making his international debut the following year. the world was his. ten months out was a test, therefore, both physically and emotionally. how would he handle that challenge? ""really well,"" insists rolfes. ""from the mental side, he is incredible. how he works, how ambitious he is, how stable he is emotionally. everyone sees the technical side, the fantastic passes, the dribbling, whatever. but this side of him is amazing. he is just so focused."" the result is that he has returned to the team without missing a beat. there was an assist in his first start against bochum last month and another in a man-of-the-match performance against hoffenheim in completing his first full minutes at the weekend. it is not just that he is back but back to his best. that pace to run away from players is there. his low centre of gravity allows him to hold off markers untroubled. there is no indication that the injury has lowered his ceiling. it delayed him rather than slowed him down. the mental strength is evident in his play. the most skilful player on the pitch is among the hardest working, encouraging others to join him in the pressing. ""already at this young age, he is a leader of this team, inspiring the other players with his behaviour."" at times, he seemed to playing as a no just off adam hlozek, though there was flexibility there with the shape shifting from -- to -- in and out of possession. whatever the system, wirtz was the one who looked most comfortable in tight spaces. it is all there in his game, the one-touch lay-offs, the awareness to flick balls around the corner. ""he is an excellent player but also an excellent team player. he makes the other players better around him. the top players have this ability,"" explains rolfes. ""one thing i already mentioned is the mental side, but also from a technical side, he finds the spaces to score, to give assists, to accelerate the game. in those positions, he can find solutions."" wirtz is the answer for leverkusen. ""the key player for us."" the question is just how good he could become. ""the potential is huge."" that is for another day. for now, let us simply celebrate the return of this special talent. ""it is really great to see that he is back."" another saturday, another chance to win PS, with super . play for free, entries by pm. (c) sky uk'}",exequiel palacios,en,2023-02-16T23:56:00Z

watch replay: leverkusen - bayern munich (espn+, us only) after a super lively start by bayern and a string of early shots in the opening minutes, leverkusen fans would have been forgiven for expecting a tough afternoon. joshua kimmich gave the visitors the lead, with his shot taking a chunky deflection on its way to the roof of the net. but that would be as good as it got for a sloppy bayern side who, without the injured eric maxim choupo-moting, were punished in full after the break. this is more proof that galtier is out of his depth; he has no clue of what he is doing or of what he should be doing. compared to the previous clubs he has been in charge of -- saint-etienne, lille and nice -- psg\'s level of talent, pressure and expectations is too high for the -year-old. he cannot manage a dressing room like the one at psg. he is too limited tactically, not good enough in his man management and has struggled to create any style for this team. he has lost four league matches already, all in , to add to elimination against bayern in the last of the champions league and against marseille in the coupe de france. the problem might be bigger and deeper than the manager and of course the players, the sporting director luis campos, the club led by the chairman nasser al khelaifi also have to take some of the blame. galtier should finish the campaign, but it would make no sense from a paris point of view to still have him on the bench next season. he is not taking the club forward and he is not good enough. -- laurens barcelona\'s - clasico win over real madrid at camp nou on sunday all but secured the laliga title for barca for the first time since . madrid goalkeeper thibaut courtois admitted as much after the match: ""we have to be honest. they\'d have to lose four games, and we\'d have to win them all. nothing is impossible, but it\'s very difficult."" - marsden: barca\'s th clasico win has decided the laliga race franck kessie\'s nd minute goal gave barca the three points as the home side hit madrid, desperate for a winner themselves, on the counter-attack. just minutes earlier, marco asensio looked to have revived the title race, only for his close-range finish to be disallowed with a narrow offside call. it was an evenly matched game -- both teams had good spells -- but barca were more dangerous overall, with shots to madrid\'s , seven on target to madrid\'s three, for an xg of . to madrid\'s .. the visitors were at their best when chasing a win late on after coach carlo ancelotti introduced the dynamic dani ceballos, rodrygo and asensio, only for kessie to break their hearts in added time. it was one of the most thrilling encounters in the fa cup this season, a proper championship battle between sheffield united and blackburn rovers in which the latter had less than minutes to hang on and seal a place in the semifinals. but in front of their fans at bramall lane, the blades overturned the result in magnificent fashion. oli mcburnie\'s equalizer in the st minute made it - and with extra time looking certain, manchester city loanee tommy doyle scored a beautiful goal from way outside the box in the st minute to give paul heckingbottom\'s squad a famous win. sheffield united, currently second in the championship with high hopes for a return to the premier league, now have a semifinal spot in the fa cup. the only caveat? their next opponent is city, and doyle sadly won\'t be able to feature against his parent club. oh, well. it\'s the cup isn\'t it? great, almost impossible things have happened. you\'re allowed to dream, sheffield united. even if your next opponent is the godzilla that is man city. -- echegaray it is a huge step towards champions league qualification for maurizio sarri\'s team. they dominated the ball against a side reduced to men after minutes but struggled to really create much, until zaccagni\'s goal. the precision and curve on his finish was thierry henry-esque. lazio have now done the double over roma in the league for the first time since the - season and sunday was very much zaccagni\'s day. amongst italian players, only vincenzo grifo at freiburg () has been directly involved in more goals than zaccagni ( with nine goals and four assists in games) this season in the big five leagues, which makes roberto mancini\'s decision to not call him up for italy next two matches hard to understand. nevertheless, the -year-old is the new emperor of rome. -- laurens santi gimenez fired feyenoord in front after just five minutes, before ajax took charge of the game and held a - lead thanks to edson alvarez and dusan tadic. sebastian szymanski tied it at - with about minutes to play and after plenty of nervy passages, the stage was set for lutsharel geertruida to steal it four minutes from time. the local lad, born and raised in the feyenoord academy, was celebrating his first dutch national team call-up already this week and got to be the hero on sunday, heading in david hancko\'s cross to take all three points. the table makes good reading for feyenoord fans: they\'re now six points clear with eight games left. if they go on to win a first title since , remember this moment. -- tyler lutsharel geertruida bezorgt @feyenoord een cruciale zege in de klassieker! :glowing_star:#ajafey tottenham hotspur are fourth in the premier league with games left to make sure they qualify for the next season\'s champions league, but you wouldn\'t know it listening to antonio conte\'s news conference after the - draw with southampton on saturday. conte has every right to be frustrated after watching his team concede twice in the last minutes against the bottom side in the division to throw away two valuable points but there\'s a real possibility that his post-match rant -- aimed at the club, players and owner daniel levy -- will have wider consequences. spurs are still very much in the race for the top four, but there\'s a danger the season could implode if the squad stop playing for their manager. newcastle united and liverpool are both within touching distance of spurs in fourth, and coaches eddie howe and jurgen klopp will have secretly enjoyed watching conte set fire to everything on saturday. it will only fuel the sense that the wheels are coming off at tottenham and that will suit the teams hoping to pinch a place in the champions league. momentum can have a huge influence during the run-in and spurs look like they\'re going backwards. -- dawson antonio conte lets loose on tottenham in a furious postmatch news conference following the - draw with southampton. passing a penalty kick: spontaneous, free-thinking genius when it works; embarrassing showboating when it doesn\'t. for every lionel messi and luis suarez -- who pulled it off for barcelona in -- there\'s a robert pires and that man again, henry, who got it wrong for arsenal in . on saturday, rayo vallecano\'s oscar trejo and isi palazon joined the elite club of players to have attempted football\'s cheekiest move. it didn\'t go well. rayo\'s laliga game with girona had already provided its fair share of entertainment -- trejo and isi scoring one spectacular goal each to put the home side - up -- when rayo were awarded a first-half penalty. trejo\'s initial effort was saved, but when it had to be retaken, the rayo captain opted to roll the ball to isi, who -- stretching for the ball -- shot over the bar to red faces all round. girona\'s second-half equaliser, leaving the match tied at -, only made matters worse. rayo are having an excellent season but it\'s now six games without a win, dropping to eighth in the table and losing ground in the race for european football. -- kirkland through the years, football fans have had the pleasure of witnessing many marvelous players who have thrilled us with their creativity on the pitch. some have mesmerized us with their footwork or educated us with their precise vision; others have dazzled with their technique. ultimately, as football fanatics and lovers of the game, when it comes to the plethora of talent across the globe, we are privileged enough to say that we have seen it all... ... and yet i don\'t think we have seen anything like erling haaland. let\'s run through the numbers. earlier this week, the norwegian striker kicked things off with a casual five-goal performance against rb leipzig in the champions league, making history and becoming the only player alongside messi to score that many goals in a ucl knockout stage match, and one of three (luiz adriano the other) to score five in a champions league game. oh, and he broke tommy johnson\'s manchester city club record of goals in a single season, which had stood for years. then on saturday in the fa cup, haaland notched his sixth hat trick of the season in a - quarterfinal victory against burnley. ""every goal means a lot to me and to win - is amazing against a really, really good burnley side. i have not set a goal target,"" said haaland after the game. ""i\'m a striker, i love to score goals, but my focus is not on scoring. it is to get good chances, and then there is a good chance of me scoring, we have to go again."" this is what makes haaland so special. aside from his superhuman physical attributes and incredible abilities on the pitch, haaland\'s mindset is different to almost any other striker we have ever seen. he doesn\'t think about goals. he thinks about the opportunity to score them, meaning that his only objective in a game is to create a chance, not a goal. a shark has to keep moving otherwise it will die, and this is how i see haaland, a player who needs to keep searching for chances by constantly moving around the pitch. there is no opportunity he won\'t seek to exploit. the scariest part? he\'s still not the finished product. my friends: haaland is inevitable. -- echegaray'}",exequiel palacios,en,2023-03-20T01:35:10Z

"the bundesliga fluctuations in munich this season are so frequent and so wild that it cannot help but invite scrutiny it may have taken a double save from the unpredictable hradecky late on to deny leroy sane then alphonso davies, but leverkusen had not stolen this. they were the better team and not just that, they had controlled the key moments of the game better. if some have cast alonso in a similar role to steven gerrard at aston villa, forging an apprenticeship before meeting destiny and taking the top job at his old club after reaching maturity (a perception not publicly discouraged by the bayern top brass), the way the story has decanted has been quite different. if alonso's fledgling managerial career should be considered with more reserve, the initial results are extremely positive, especially when considering he took over a side battling the drop that were (at least on paper) not particularly well equipped for that sort of challenge. the feeling within the club is that alonso's skill in communication has been the key, getting his ideas across to the players quickly and clearly. this sort of clarity is something we expect from nagelsmann. ""if we combine maximum hunger and passion with the quality that we have, then we can achieve anything,"" he said afterwards, yet for a man of such insight and intelligence, the coach is in danger of stating the absolute obvious. this is clear and it would be surprising to few if bayern came out all guns blazing to face dortmund and if they found the fire to dismantle their opponents. but this cycle of action and reaction is not just familiar bayern narrative; it is familiar bayern narrative that predates nagelsmann. and if we know the script so well from years past it must pose the question - how much are bayern actually progressing under their widely admired coach? the fluctuations in bayern this season are so frequent and so wild that it cannot help but invite scrutiny. they may well provide a response against dortmund, but it seems unlikely to be a definitive answer. dortmund had taken the leadership on saturday with an impressively efficient - rout of okoln (""we were ice-cold in front of goal,"" as mo dahoud put it). two goals from marco reus took him past the -mark for the club and a brace from sebastien haller was also welcome. what's more is that after a couple of taxing weeks they might get back some missing personnel for the visit to munich, with emre can, karim adeyemi, youssoufa moukoko, salih ozcan and julian brandt all absent for this game. leipzig's week, meanwhile, went from bad to worse as they slipped to defeat at lowly bochum, following their champions league hiding in manchester by dropping out of the top four. marco rose raged at erhan masovic's winner from christopher antwi-adjei's long throw.

marsden: barcelona\'s th clasico win has surely settled title race - replay: barcelona vs. real madrid, laliga, espn+ upshot? had asensio been less than an inch farther from the goal, real madrid would probably have won, the gap would have been six points and we\'d be praising them for their patience and saying they deserved the victory. instead, the gap is points and yes, we can say barca deserved the win. because that\'s football. goals (and goals not given) change games. craig burley thinks fulham players losing their temper let manchester united back in the game to win - in the fa cup quarterfinals. ancelotti\'s changes nearly did the trick at the end, but too often this is how madrid has felt this season: they\'ve been a team of moments and highlights, rather than a side capable of imposing themselves on a top opponent on the road. stranger things have happened in football, so you may not want to crown barca just yet. but at this stage, nobody is going to take the - laliga title from them -- they\'d have to throw it away themselves. for an hour or so, manchester united were tied up in knots by a fulham side that deservedly took the lead at old trafford. united were at home against a side coming off back-to-back defeats and yet managed just five shots on goal, for a total xg of .. they were also a goal down, having been outplayed by fulham for long stretches. then it all fell apart for the visitors. willian blocked jadon sancho\'s goal-bound shot with his arm, like a keeper might. var went to a review and awarded a penalty and a red card, as per the rules. aleksandar mitrovic reacted by putting his hands on the referee, manager marco silva wandered angrily out of the technical area, and both were sent off. bruno fernandes converted the penalty and two minutes later marcel sabitzer scored his first united goal to make it -, before bruno added a third in garbage time. steve nicol analyses bukayo saka\'s performance in arsenal\'s - win over crystal palace. as self-destruction goes, this one was entirely unnecessary. maybe willian\'s act was instinctive or uncoordinated; the irony is that had his arm not extended away from his body, he might have intercepted sancho\'s shot anyway, but the reaction of mitrovic and silva, both experienced operators, is hard to forgive. the video evidence was obvious, and there was no point in venting your fury at referee chris kavanagh -- he\'s not the one who asked var to intervene. at -, even a man down, you were still very much in the game given how well fulham were playing. with nine men, there was no shot. - dawson: man united seize on fulham\'s frustrations - replay: man united vs. fulham, fa cup, espn+ from united\'s perspective this was a poor outing. thankfully for them, it was overshadowed by the result and fulham\'s shenanigans, otherwise it might have been a talking point over the international break. inzaghi was unhappy that the var did not disallow filip kostic\'s goal. there were three potential handballs in the buildup -- two from dusan vlahovic, one from adrien rabiot -- yet one wasn\'t punishable, as vlahovic\'s arm was tight to his body, and the other two were far from clear-cut, according to the var. frankly, watching it time and again, you tend to agree with him. what was clear-cut, however was inter\'s horrendous defending on kostic\'s goal, especially by denzel dumfries. equally clear-cut was inter\'s lack of discipline in the second half when they took a ton of shots, most of them chaotic, desperation attempts. as for juve, this was nowhere near the dominating performance some make it out to be. they went a whole half-hour without a single attempt at goal. they didn\'t create much but they held fast when it mattered -- including guys like federico gatti, who was savaged by the pundits after some poor early season performances -- and now it\'s wins, one draw and one defeat in their past games. were it not for the points penalty -- which could yet be overturned -- they\'d be in second place, while they also have a europa league quarterfinal and coppa italia semifinal to look forward to. it doesn\'t mean max allegri is suddenly a genius again and the long-term answer, but it does mean he has been a steady hand after a turbulent start. antonio conte lets loose on tottenham in a furious postmatch news conference following the -

up against the last-placed team with minutes to go and watched your side retreat further and further towards their own goal, defending ever more limply and eventually conceding twice to draw -, you might be angry too. possibly as angry as antonio conte was. the difference, of course, is that you probably aren\'t spurs manager, unlike conte, and you\'re not the one responsible for how the players play. which, to be fair, was overly conservative, tame and hapless, more than it was ""selfish,"" on saturday. conte, however, opted to call them selfish while also calling out the club, their culture and how in the past years they had won close to nothing (well, one league cup). gab marcotti and julien laurens sing the praises of serie a leaders napoli on ""the gab and juls show."" one paper in england said conte\'s rant may have ""saved his reputation more than his job."" that may well be right. why? because many spurs fans are just as angry with the players and the owners as they are with conte. they\'re well aware it has been two decades of underachievement, and that some of the coaches who came before conte, such as mauricio pochettino and jose mourinho, made similar points, at least about the owners. so yeah, the narrative of the proven winner who calls out mediocrity and selfishness all around him may apply (to some, at least) and conte simply burnished his reputation as an ambitious perfectionist who demands excellence. - conte slams ""selfish"" spurs after southampton draw - ogden: sack conte after spurs rant? they should offer him a new deal and yes, it probably won\'t help him keep his job, because players -- many of whom have long contracts, certainly longer than conte\'s, which expires in three months -- don\'t like being called out in public. oh, and owners -- the guys who pay his salary -- like it even less. that said, it\'s kinda easy to ""speak truth to power"" when you know your contract is up in three months. you have nothing to lose because you\'ve shown, time and again, that you have no problem walking out on jobs as conte did at juventus, at chelsea, with italy and with inter. whatever psychological damage might have come from getting knocked out of the champions league appears to have been well and truly metabolized by borussia dortmund. saturday\'s - rout of cologne wasn\'t just wholly deserved; it also reinforced how edin terzic appears to have found, for now anyway, that balance that so often has eluded him in the past. most of all, this feels like a team ready to go head-to-head with bayern the rest of the way. top of the championship side burnley play open, attacking football. manager vincent kompany chose not to deviate from the script for the trip to face manchester city away, and the outcome was predictable: a - city rout. you\'re not going to blame him for it -- burnley\'s real goal is promotion and while they have points and a game in hand over the third-place club with nine to go, it\'s best not to take chances, even if that means turning it into a test of football ability city are unlikely to lose. erling haaland again took the headlines, scoring a hat trick inside an hour (and getting promptly substituted). you want numbers? that\'s now goals in games in all competitions, surpassing his personal seasonal best of , set with borussia dortmund in -. - dawson: haaland\'s heroics push man city into fa cup semifinals - replay: man city vs. burnley, fa cup, espn+ barring injury, he\'ll have to games left this season, so a -goal campaign kinda feels more than likely. heck, he might even break dixie dean\'s mark of goals in a campaign, which he set for everton nearly years ago. and yes, haaland is still just . julien laurens believes christophe galtier\'s time at psg is up after their surprise -

soccer\'s kardashian curse? superstar sees arsenal, psg defeats in person capitulating - at home to rennes in the way they did only ratchets up the chaos and insecurity around this club. precisely the sort of chaos that manager christophe galtier was supposed to be able to deal with when he was appointed, which is why you imagine he won\'t be back next season even if, as appears likely, they win ligue . saturday night\'s - defeat at udinese leaves milan with points from their past games, which is pretty much a relegation pace. that won\'t happen, obviously, but now even a top-four spot -- their minimum objective at the start of the season -- is in serious jeopardy, and will be in even greater jeopardy if juventus\' points penalty gets overturned. against udinese, they made a string of defensive mistakes (fikayo tomori and malick thiaw above all) while creating very little upfront. their only goal was a generous penalty, which zlatan ibrahimovic converted to make it into the record books as the oldest player ever to score in serie a. so much for the idea that stefano pioli\'s switch to a back three last month was some sort of solution. yes, they won some back-to-back games, but it felt alien to what they were doing last season and to the skill set of the players. and sure enough, they\'re back to where they were under the previous setup. the back three was seen as some sort of solution to concede goals when, in fact, that\'s down to a general lack of intensity throughout the team since the break. the real issue, however, is on the attacking front. while their -game rolling xg conceded on jan. was . and now stands at ., the real difference is in xg scored: from . down to .. atletico madrid\'s - win over valencia might have taken a different turn if hugo duro\'s goal had not been disallowed, but make no mistake about it, this was another impressive performance for diego simeone\'s crew, who are now games unbeaten. in fact, memphis depay could have scored a couple before antoine griezmann finally opened the scoring in the rd minute. griezmann\'s renaissance this season, including his performance at the world cup, has been stunning. it\'s not just returning to atletico -- he was here last year too, on loan -- but the fact that he has developed into a more rounded player, ready to take on more of a leadership role. and now that simeone has found some sort of balance in the setup, griezmann is giving atleti a different dimension. after three wins on the bounce, chelsea drew - at home against burnley, but this was one of those games in which the performance counts more than the result. against an opponent that sat deep, clogged space and relied on set pieces like sean dyche teams usually do -- ""we\'d all like to play beautiful football, including me... but you\'ve got to find ways of affecting the opposition,"" he said afterwards -- chelsea had plenty of the ball (%) and tried to do things with it. not just through individual sparks (though there was plenty of that), but through movement and patterns of play. they failed to put the game away, however, and ultimately paid the price for some poor defending against substitute ellis simms. - pulisic talks to espn: u.s. soccer, world cup, club aspirations and more lazio\'s - derby win over rome has a lot to do with two factors: the performance of winger mattia zaccagni, who scored the only goal, and the two pointless bookings picked up by roma\'s roger ibanez, who was sent off after half an hour. it was typical derby fare: a tight game with plenty of atmosphere and the right dose of nasty (the latter as evidenced by bryan cristante and adam marusic getting themselves sent off after the final whistle). it was a tacit acknowledgement that roma were going to settle for the draw (and maybe a set-piece goal if it came to that) rather than trying to impose themselves a man down. and they paid a price for it. lazio are now second in the table; considering they have the sixth-highest wage bill in serie a and they\'ve been without their star striker ciro immobile, it\'s no small feat. and, of course, this being the rome derby, there was more to come after the game, with mourinho turning up in the players\' tunnel and clashing with lazio president claudio lotito. according to italian media reports, it went like this: mourinho: ""what the f--- are you looking at?"" lotito: ""i\'m the president of lazio... who are you? this is my house... you shouldn\'t even be here."" and off they went. edifying? no. entertaining? yup. if only the cameras had been rolling.'}",exequiel palacios,en,2023-03-20T18:07:28Z

"thomas muller stresses the importance of a positive result in der klassiker vs. borussia dortmund. (:) will ousting julian nagelsmann to bring in thomas tuchel prove a masterstroke in saving a stuttering, but not directionless, season from collapse? or, alternatively, will it be seen as a hasty and expensive moment of panic by a skittish set of decision-makers in munich? the prevalent view at this moment among the public reflects the latter. to jettison ""long-term project"" coach nagelsmann at a colossal cost, just because bayern are under more pressure than anticipated and tuchel happens to be available, seems illogical and shortsighted to the average fan. absolutely no one was predicting this turn of events when some of us -- with the bundesliga on pause -- took what we thought was a timely week off to recharge. immediately before the nagelsmann-out-tuchel-in whirlwind, i tweeted something that seemed to me entirely uncontroversial, proclaiming that the bundesliga is -- from top to bottom -- the most exciting top league in europe this season. i stand by those words, although they seemed to draw the ire of some who probably would tell you the premier league is always the most gripping league anyway, simply because ... well, it\'s the ""best league in the world."" - stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga, more (u.s.) - bayern vs. dortmund: saturday, : p.m. et, abc and espn+ i challenge anyone to find a more engrossing high-profile race anywhere than the fascinating dortmund-bayern seesaw, the sides a mere one point apart and ready to lock horns at the allianz arena before , fans in a game that will serve as more than a weather vane in this most tempestuous of bundesliga seasons. bayern took the lead through joshua kimmich, but what happened next falls in the category of things we never thought we\'d see on a football pitch. twice leverkusen\'s amine adli was booked for diving by referee tobias stieler, but in each case the card was rescinded and a penalty awarded after an on-pitch var review. exequiel palacios beat yann sommer both times from the spot to ensure that bayern are in the unfamiliar position of second place this late in the season. how have they done it? there has been good luck along the way, such as in the wild - win against fc augsburg and the excruciating second half bvb suffered through before overcoming rb leipzig -. crucially, though, it hasn\'t always been about one or two players, but instead different characters emerging, like emre can and karim adeyemi -- before his injury -- who were previously underperforming. nico schlotterbeck, with his heart-on-sleeve style, has become a firm favourite in a city that appreciates grit and passion. his central defensive partnership with former bayern man niklas sule has given dortmund a firm base to build on while keeping mats hummels mostly on the sidelines. we must mention julian brandt, who -- prior to leaving the round-of- second leg against chelsea in the champions league due to a muscular problem -- has put together his purest run of form since joining from leverkusen in . even his defensive work is massively improved. at the time of writing, bvb are hopeful brandt can play some part on saturday. jude bellingham is the young star who, on the other hand, likely will leave the club for colossal money at the end of the campaign. while there aren\'t many better all-around midfield players in world football, bvb have even been able to afford a slight formtief (form dip) from the england international recently. over the past two games, raphael guerreiro has gone from ""likely to leave the club with his contract up this summer"" to a newfound source of industry and wizardry in the midfield. sporting chief sebastian kehl has made a point of saying they are still in talks with the portugal international regarding the future. in goalkeeper gregor kobel, they have the bundesliga\'s best this term, although he has been injured for several weeks. alex meyer is a capable deputy, but not of the same quality. for all of this we must praise terzic, a dortmund fan to the core who grew up in menden in the sauerland just a short drive from the city. this is his second spell in charge and in his previous stint, he guided bvb to dfb-pokal success, outdoing nagelsmann, the then coach of leipzig, in the final. since the days of jurgen klopp, the last dortmund trainer to win the meisterschale, they\'ve struggled to find a coach who fits the emotional personality of the club and its wider community -- and that includes terzic\'s opposite number on saturday, tuchel. that\'s not to say terzic is a klopp clone, but he identifies with and indeed shares the club\'s heartbeat in a way his immediate predecessors haven\'t. so, will dortmund finally outdo bayern in a big game after a run of eight bundesliga matches without a win (seven of them defeats) against them? you can make a case for it, but it would be the height of folly to think bayern, with a superb squad, will simply succumb to a motivated bvb and the magnitude of the occasion. if anything, they\'re rarely more dangerous than immediately after a slip-up. league defeats at augsburg and borussia monchengladbach this season have been followed by resounding victories over leverkusen and union. wednesday, may (all times et) * valencia vs. villarreal (: p.m.) * stuttgart vs. frankfurt (: p.m.) * atletico madrid vs. cadiz ( p.m.) * getafe vs. celta vigo ( p.m.) thursday, may (all times et) * sevilla vs. espanyol (: p.m.) * girona vs. mallorca (: p.m.) * athletic club vs. real betis (: p.m.) * rayo vs. valladolid (: p.m.) friday, may (all times et) dayot upamecano is talented but still errorprone, although benjamin pavard and matthijs de ligt have made positive strides in recent weeks. joao cancelo hasn\'t quite fired yet in his four league starts and two substitute appearances, while canada\'s alphonso davies has offered a mixed bag this year. the players who have suffered the biggest form dips and come in for most media scrutiny have been leroy sane and serge gnabry, and it\'s hard to imagine them seeing the coaching change as anything but a positive. kingsley coman, on the other hand, has excelled when picked, but nagelsmann often deployed him as a substitute. sadio mane is not long back from more than three months on the sidelines due to a knee injury and failed to impress in his minutes against leverkusen. it would, however, give thomas muller the starting guarantee he didn\'t always enjoy under nagelsmann. again it\'s tempting to think back to flick\'s days at the helm and how he quickly made muller a key building block again after he had fallen out of favour under niko kovac. tuchel knows he must give careful thought to how to deploy a german football legend. bayern\'s thomas muller reveals his favourite match against borussia dortmund and explains what the rivalry means. kimmich was regarded as nagelsmann\'s extended arm on the pitch, and it\'s clear the decision last week has come as a jolt to bayern\'s midfield fulcrum and close friend leon goretzka, both of whom will have key roles to play on saturday for a new coach up against bellingham, can & co. now his job is to stop his old club from stealing the limelight away from his new team, with barely any time to coherently get his message across. i can\'t wait for saturday, and hope you\'ll clear the decks and join us for live coverage. the latest bayern-dortmund instalment could be epic.'}",exequiel palacios,en,2023-03-30T13:39:50Z

""now we don't just have to deal with selfish power people who are only concerned about personal gain,"" said pering, ""but also with collective incompetence."" bernstein was bold at the epic, seven-and-a-half-hour agm, telling attendees that the project to build a new, more intimate and suitable stadium than the cavernous olympiastadion was on track, and reiterating the plan to move forwards with youth academy products. yet tom herrich, the managing director, confirming that there was indeed work to do to secure the licence for next season meant he provided the weightiest words from the stage all day. after stuttgart's draw with leverkusen on sunday - andreas ""zecke"" neuendorf, hertha's licensing director, broke news of exequiel palacios' equaliser for die werkself during his own speech as a rallying cry - the berlin club need almost a mathematical miracle to escape. yet the real verdict had fallen on friday night. if anyone was in any doubt about how deep the malaise runs at hertha, dardai's team had already given the most eloquent statement possible on the matter. kick off your evenings with the guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion koln - hertha berlin vfl bochum - augsburg wolfsburg - hoffenheim bayern munich - schalke union berlin - freiburg borussia dortmund - borussia monchengladbach vfb stuttgart - bayer leverkusen rb leipzig - werder bremen borussia dortmund stayed on bayern's tail with a - victory over borussia monchengladbach. it featured a first half as ruthless as old bayern (they were - up at the break) and a coda which was more old dortmund, as they carelessly shipped two late goals and needed a great gregor kobel save from lars stindl, who scored gladbach's second, to prevent the visitors from pulling it back to -, before gio reyna tapped in with the game's final kick. despite the late ""stuttgart vibes"" as julian brandt put it - referencing dortmund's late surrender of a lead against the -man strugglers a few weeks back - the mood is positive before what is likely to be a pivotal week: bayern face champions league-chasing leizpig and bvb, fragile on the road of late, go to augsburg. another huge blow for the fading freiburgers was dominik szoboszlai's late, late winner for leipzig in sunday's game against werder bremen, in which they had trailed to a leonardo bittencourt sucker punch before christopher nkunku brilliantly created goals for willi orban and his fellow hungarian in the dying minutes. it could also tweak the title race. with a four-point lead over freiburg in fifth (and a far superior goal difference), marco rose and company now go to munich with a desire for points rather than a desperate need for them.""}",exequiel palacios,en,2023-05-15T09:43:15Z

"the bundesliga fluctuations in munich this season are so frequent and so wild that it cannot help but invite scrutiny it may have taken a double save from the unpredictable hradecky late on to deny leroy sane then alphonso davies, but leverkusen had not stolen this. they were the better team and not just that, they had controlled the key moments of the game better. if some have cast alonso in a similar role to steven gerrard at aston villa, forging an apprenticeship before meeting destiny and taking the top job at his old club after reaching maturity (a perception not publicly discouraged by the bayern top brass), the way the story has decanted has been quite different. if alonso's fledgling managerial career should be considered with more reserve, the initial results are extremely positive, especially when considering he took over a side battling the drop that were (at least on paper) not particularly well equipped for that sort of challenge. the feeling within the club is that alonso's skill in communication has been the key, getting his ideas across to the players quickly and clearly. this sort of clarity is something we expect from nagelsmann. ""if we combine maximum hunger and passion with the quality that we have, then we can achieve anything,"" he said afterwards, yet for a man of such insight and intelligence, the coach is in danger of stating the absolute obvious. this is clear and it would be surprising to few if bayern came out all guns blazing to face dortmund and if they found the fire to dismantle their opponents. but this cycle of action and reaction is not just familiar bayern narrative; it is familiar bayern narrative that predates nagelsmann. and if we know the script so well from years past it must pose the question - how much are bayern actually progressing under their widely admired coach? the fluctuations in bayern this season are so frequent and so wild that it cannot help but invite scrutiny. they may well provide a response against dortmund, but it seems unlikely to be a definitive answer. dortmund had taken the leadership on saturday with an impressively efficient - rout of okoln (""we were ice-cold in front of goal,"" as mo dahoud put it). two goals from marco reus took him past the -mark for the club and a brace from sebastien haller was also welcome. what's more is that after a couple of taxing weeks they might get back some missing personnel for the visit to munich, with emre can, karim adeyemi, youssoufa moukoko, salih ozcan and julian brandt all absent for this game. leipzig's week, meanwhile, went from bad to worse as they slipped to defeat at lowly bochum, following their champions league hiding in manchester by dropping out of the top four. marco rose raged at erhan masovic's winner from christopher antwi-adjei's long throw. ""we talked about it and we still can't defend it,"" he complained. meanwhile, union followed their european exit with a - win over freefalling frankfurt which lifted them back up to third. it's still all happening at the bottom, where a fourth successive scoring game for marius bulter rescued a point for schalke at augsburg, while a first win for hoffenheim under pellegrino materazzo - over hertha - saw them leapfrog their opponents, who fall into the playoff position.

" ronald koeman launched a scathing assessment of jeremie frimpong's defensive abilities when explaining his omission from the squad for holland's upcoming euro qualifiers. the bayer leverkusen defender - who is a reported manchester united target - was blasted by koeman when the former barcelona boss was asked why the right-back was dropped from louis van gaal's squad that went to qatar. the holland boss claimed that he has 'doubts' over frimpong's abilities with his back to goal, suggesting that he would not fit in the former everton and southampton manager's preferred system. the -year-old is thought to have caught erik ten hag's eye after a strong season in the bundesliga, with seven goals and five assists. united have looked to both diogo dalot and aaron wan-bissaka at right-back this season, with both impressing when called upon, but the red devils are thought to be interested in bringing in a third option. ronald koeman criticised jeremie frimpong's defensive ability despite being called up to louis van gaal's world cup squad koeman slammed dutch defender frimpong - who is a reported target for manchester united 'no frimpong? this is because of the system that we play in,' koeman said. 'he plays almost as a right winger. my right back should be able to defend well in the first place and i have my doubts about that.' frimpong has kept five clean sheets in the bundesliga at the back for leverkusen, although his talents lie higher up the field as one of the league's more attacking full-backs. he is still yet to make his international debut, with koeman leaving him out, and seemingly set to continue to do so until he sees what he determines a a sufficient improvement in frimpong's defensive game. holland will first take on france in a mouth-watering clash between two of europe's giants in euro qualifying group b, before a clash with relative minnows gibraltar. frimpong has seven goals and five assists in the bundesliga but his bayer leverkusen side have conceded goals in games right-back is just one of the positions that ten hag's side seem set to target in the upcoming window, amid their ongoing squad rebuild. the red devils have been linked with numerous players over the last months, but one player who appears to have rejected their advances is frenkie de jong, who claimed he hopes to stay at barcelona 'for many years'. as a result, they have been linked with several midfield targets for the summer, and have reportedly made an advance for porto's ex-liverpool midfielder marko grujic. and they could be set for a decision to make, with the club rumoured to be suitors for both england striker harry kane - who is out of contract next year - and napoli hitman victor osimhen who is serie a's top scorer. share what you think",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-03-22T10:35:51Z

" check out the transfer rumours of all the players who could move to old trafford ahead of next season while this approach hasn\'t resulted in a premier league title in years, manchester united are invariably always willing to shell out on yet another high-profile transfer in a bid at glory once again. many of the players they are linked with usually don\'t end up joining the club, but if they do, it\'s usually to great fanfare and plenty of expectation. david de gea is often cited as not being good competent enough with the ball at his feet to play long-term for erik ten hag, but that hasn\'t stopped emi martinez\'s dad from posturing to the red devils. speaking to tyc sports, martinez\'s dad said that he personally hopes a move to manchester united materialises amid links with the argentine goalkeeper. raya has just a year left on his contract and would seem like the smart buy for united, given that they have other targets to acquire across the pitch. the spaniard is well thought of, however, by rivals, while employers brentford may look to tie him down to better terms - especially if they qualify for europe this season. costa, meanwhile, has a release clause of around PSm. with porto unlikely to budge on that, it seems as if the portuguese may well be a last resort if united fail to negotiate other deals or miss out on targets. disasi and bastoni aren\'t the only defenders being targeted for this summer, though. at right-back, denzel dumfries has been consistently linked with manchester united in recent years, and could finally make the switch in the summer. inter milan are reportedly interested in diogo dalot, too, meaning there could be potential for a swap deal between the two clubs, according to gazzetta dello sport. other right-back options are on the radar, too. tomori has impressed since moving to serie a, has the kind of recovery pace that maguire lacks and is comfortable on both feet and on both sides of a defensive pairing. the england international has controversially seen his game time under gareth southgate limited, too, as the three lions manager opts for maguire - out-of-favour at club level - over the rock of a serie a title win last season. according to the sun, brighton winger kaoru mitoma is high up on erik ten hag\'s shortlist, the manchester united manager impressed with the japan international\'s dazzling displays on the south coast this season. with manchester united still light in central midfield, the sun are reporting that fulham\'s joao palhinha is a top target for the side. the portuguese midfielder has impressed at craven cottage this season, and would be the perfect replacement for casemiro if the brazilian is ever missing. he will be available on a cut-price deal, though it is still possible negotiations between mount and chelsea will make a breakthrough towards the end of the season. brighton midfielder alexis mac allister will seemingly be highly-sought after this summer, with manchester united among the interested parties. indeed, according to cbs sports, united held discussions with the argentine\'s representatives since world cup . however, brighton will likely command a transfer fee exceeding PS million. a bonkers swap deal between manchester united and tottenham hotspur could be on the cards, with the former offering dean henderson plus cash in exchange for harry kane. after manchester evening news (opens in new tab) suggested that tottenham are demanding a nine-figure fee upfront for kane, espn reported that manchester united were willing to get creative in their pursuit for england\'s record goalscorer. that involves adding henderson, currently on loan at nottingham forest, into a potential deal between the two sides. kane is also said to be interested in a move to old trafford, with the allure of trophies set to bring his time at tottenham to an end. however, sky sports believe spurs chairman daniel levy isn\'t willing to negotiate for his star striker whatsoever - despite him having just a year left on his contract in the summer. victor osimhen is also heavily linked with a transfer, with manchester united lacking a dominant striker up front. while this would involve a hefty price tag - PS million, according to il mattino - osimhen has said it is an ""ambition"" to move to the premier league one day. ac milan\'s raphael leao is also on the radar for manchester united, and could dovetail well with marcus rashford on either the left-wing or as a centre-forward, depending on erik ten hag\'s tactical plan. according to pianetamilan, leao would welcome a move to the premier league, with his contract expiring in . the -year-old moved to germany last summer from nantes and has taken european football by storm this term. kolo muani has goals and assists from matches up front - and was a part of the france squad that reached the world cup final, stepping in for the injured christopher nkunku on the eve of the competition. as such, his price tag will have shot up - and chelsea are said to have reservations about atletico\'s PSm valuation of the portuguese international, potentially leaving the door open for united to pounce. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. jude bellingham has agreement for real madrid transfer with six-year deal: report why isn\'t liverpool vs fulham on tv in the uk? \'we got on fantastically well\': joey barton recalls changing next to pep guardiola at manchester city when the spaniard was on trial towards the end of his playing career (c)",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-03-24T15:45:33Z

" manchester united are looking at the french defender tipped to take over from raphael varane's considerable mantle - for club and country manchester united are poised to make a move for raphael varane's successor in defence. last month, the highly-decorated defender announced his retirement from international football, aged just . in years of playing for the french national side, varane won the world cup and the nations league, making caps. in an injury-plagued time at manchester united, varane has been essential to the defence - but now, thoughts are turning to a future without the centre-back for both club and country. one late inclusion to france's world cup squad, axel disasi is a target for united, according to caughtoffside (opens in new tab). the monaco stopper was given a debut in qatar and will likely feature a lot more in the coming years with varane out of the set-up - with french football expert jonathan johnson suggesting that the -year-old could be a solid squad option for erik ten hag, if not an elite answer for the back four. ""monaco defender axel disasi is an interesting player who's starting to attract links with the likes of manchester united ahead of the summer,"" johnson said. ""he's in that kind of 'finishing school' phase that aurelien tchouameni was in when he was there, and that someone like wesley fofana is in with chelsea right now. he's now made the breakthrough at international level and that's helped get him onto the radar of a number of big clubs. for someone like united, i think he would add competition to their squad, but i do have questions about whether or not he'd be the best fit for erik ten hag's side and where they are now."" ""i think disasi will definitely be coveted by premier league clubs in the future, but it wouldn't surprise me if it ended up being someone a level below manchester united, one of those clubs aspiring to get it into the champions league reckoning."" while not expected to reach the heights that varane has in his career, the added cover for united would certainly be welcome. luke shaw has had to fill in at centre-back this season, while harry maguire has not been fully trusted by ten hag. disasi is valued at EUR million by transfermarkt (opens in new tab). thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. martin odegaard implemented 'crazy' training methods while on loan at vitesse arnhem in holland in / liverpool vs fulham live stream, match preview, team news and kick-off time for this premier league match by mark white may by mark white may by mark white may by mark white may by mark white may by mark white may by mark white may (c)",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-03-31T15:00:00Z

(jpw) :camera_with_flash: cristiano ronaldo and his agent jorge mendes arriving at carrington one way or the other, the cristiano ronaldo want-away transfer saga must be resolved at some point, and that point in time could come much sooner rather than later. according to a report from david ornstein, ronaldo is traveling back to england and expected to meet with man united executives as well as, eventually, new manager erik ten hag. the key line, from ornstein's report: (ae) an agreement has been reached for the transfer of lisandro martinez :red_circle:#mufc || @lisandrmartinez eriksen said the following about his arrival at old trafford: ""manchester united is a special club, and i cannot wait to get started. i have had the privilege of playing at old trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of united will be an amazing feeling. ""i have seen erik's work at ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. it is clear that he is a fantastic coach. having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, i am even more excited for the future. i still have major ambitions in the game, there is a huge amount that i know i can achieve, and this is the perfect place to continue my journey."" this is a superb free transfer from united and eriksen showed his quality in the second half of last season at brentford. his intelligence on the ball and ability to play in a variety of roles across midfield and attack will be invaluable for united. so too will his experience as united have a world-class midfielder ready to help make them tick. now, how will eth fit eriksen, bruno fernandes and potentially frenkie de jong into the same team? eriksen could play a slightly deeper role and at this stage of his career, that would be perfect for him to dictate the tempo of the game and help united keep the ball. (jpw) manchester united continue to head to the netherlands for their new players as ajax and argentina defender lisandro martinez is about to join. erik ten hag was a huge fan of martinez during his time at ajax and the versatile defender (he can play center back or left back) will be key in improving this united defense. with tyrell malacia already arriving, the left-sided of united's defense could have a totally new look this season. martinez was chased by arsenal for most of this summer but martinez has decided to join united to work with eth once again. (jpw) there had been four loans for andreas pereira since the brazilian joined manchester united's academy in , but the now -year-old looks set to leave old trafford for good. pereira is headed for fulham, according to reports, with approximately $ million coming back the other way from the newly-promoted side. he has just finished a year on loan to brazil's flamengo, having scored nine times with three assists after spending the previous year on loan to serie a side lazio. pereira had his busiest year at united before that, playing pl matches and cup matches in -. loans to valencia and granada predated that.

" liverpool transfer news, live! latest reports, rumors, updates yves bissouma - brighton ($ million) djed spence - middlesbrough (up to $ million) iyenoma udogie - udinese ($ million - loaned back) clement lenglet - barcelona (loan) ivan perisic - inter milan (free transfer) - more fraser forster - southampton (free transfer)outsteven bergwijn - ajax ($. million) cameron carter-vickers - celtic ($. million, plus $. million possible add-ons) jack clarke - sunderland (undisclosed) :studio_microphone: ""it\'s a big dream come true"" :studio_microphone: ""i\'m very happy to be here"" watch bissouma's first interview as a spurs player! :oncoming_fist:  Carter-Vickers Signs! welcome back to #celticfc, @cameroncv! :four_leaf_clover: and whether spurs are a top-four team or not at the end of the premier league season will make quite a difference to their recruitment team's works. another central midfielder (more on the attacking than defensive side) might make spurs more dangerous, more consistently, going forward. below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on tottenham transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. twenty-year-old montpellier striker elye wahi has attracted lots of interest this season with goals and three assists this season. the -foot center forward had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's visit from toulouse. the advanced stats say he can carry the ball above average but basically has been strictly a finisher. sounds like someone could use some schooling from a certain harry kane. (nm) look: a tottenham story that isn't about antonio conte or harry kane... at least entirely. that's because espn says that tottenham's interest in manchester united property/serial loanee dean henderson could be used to lower the cost for kane. henderson was when he joined manchester united from carlisle united in , and he made his senior move in . henderson's on loan to nottingham forest, where it's been no surprise that he shined before going down to injury. henderson was twice sheffield united young player of the year, on loan, and won the championship golden glove in boosting the blades into the premier league. club legend hugo lloris has not been himself this season and is currently hurt, fraser forster is only under contract through -, and young keepers brandon austin and alfie whiteman have limited experience and all on loan. a solution will be needed, and soon. (nm) is a london return on the cards for longtime chelsea man antonio rudiger? maybe, according to spanish language site fichajes. the -year-old has been a regular starter at the bernabeu but the report says continued real links with new backs including rb leipzig's josko gvardiol may unsettle rudiger, who just wants regular playing time and a stable situation. (nm) ins arnaut danjuma - villarreal (loan) jude soonsup-bell - chelsea outs matt doherty (contract termination) as one full back is set to arrive in north london, another has left. right back matt doherty is now expected to join atletico madrid after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with tottenham. (ae) matt doherty may be leaving tottenham on loan to atletico madrid, according to reports, while fullback djed spence will also be leaving on loan. atleti has plenty of success with their last acquisition of a fullback from spurs, as kieran trippier shined at the wanda metropolitano. and spence reportedly turned down a loan to atleti in favor of a move to rennes in ligue , while bryan gil is going on loan to sevilla. all this as tottenham hopes to land pedro porro from sporting lisbon in a move that's been slow-cooking all month and had plenty of complications. the spence and doherty reports will give spurs fans hope that the porro deal is coming. will the second time be the charm for arnaut danjuma when it comes to the premier league? danjuma joins spurs on loan for the rest of the season. he's been playing plenty of center forward and can give harry kane a rest, but will also be plenty happy to head to the left wing. the bournemouth winger scored times last season in la liga and struck six times in uefa champions league games, including in knockout round games against juventus and bayern munich. the -year-old has six goals in matches across all competitions this season for villarreal. (nm) football.london has a very spurs-like report that tottenham has 'verbally offered' $ million for leandro trossard after the brighton man expressed his wishes to leave the amex stadium. trossard has reportedly fallen out with seagulls boss roberto de zerbi and brighton's been said to want between $- million for the playmaker. spurs landing trossard for under $ million would be at-worst a good risk and at-best an absolute coup, as the belgian has done big things for brighton. playing with a focal point like harry kane could take him to the next level. (nm) yes, tottenham's just splashed plenty of cash on a star left winger in richarlison, but would the versatility of martin terrier make him a great fit to compete with the brazilian as well as heung-min son? terrier has scored and assisted on the regular in france's top flight. he scored goals last season and has eight in matches this season. the left wing can also play center forward amongst other positions. he's chipped in three goals in the europa league this campaign and also had provided assists across all competitions since the start of last season. in richarlison - everton ($ million) - more yves bissouma - brighton ($ million) djed spence - middlesbrough (up to $ million) iyenoma udogie - udinese ($ million - loaned back) clement lenglet - barcelona (loan) ivan perisic - inter milan (free transfer) - more fraser forster - southampton (free transfer) out steven bergwijn - ajax ($. million) cameron carter-vickers - celtic ($. million, plus $. million possible add-ons) jack clarke - sunderland (undisclosed) pierluigi gollini - atalanta (end of loan) and there it is: a five-year contract for the below-mentioned teenage left back, the first year going back to udine on loan. iyenoma ""destiny"" udogie has very promising advanced stats according to fb reference, comparable to atletico madrid star renan lodi, spurs' sergio reguilon, gladbach's joe scally, and brentford's sergi canos. (nm) :studio_microphone: ""it\'s a big dream come true"" but there's a twist. there's always a twist. with superstar paul pogba arriving back at juventus this summer and expected to eat up plenty of the minutes mckennie was previously getting, pogba has just gone down with a knee injury in preseason. that requires surgery and it means juve may not move on mckennie this summer after all. another twist? mckennie is yet to feature on juventus' preseason tour of the united states of america as he was unused substitute in each of their games against barcelona and chivas guadalajara. during the tour juve boss max allegri has stated that mckennie is working his way back to full fitness, so maybe there's nothing to read into here, but it is a little odd that juventus haven't given any minutes to one of the best usmnt players on their u.s. tour, right? perhaps they aren't risking him being injured as a transfer away is imminent? mckennie seems fairly happy at juventus but it seems inevitable he will end up in the premier league at some point. (jpw) update: spurs have confirmed clement lenglet's arrival on a season-long loan from barcelona. antonio conte looks set to land the a left-sided center back he so desperately coveted this summer transfer window, with french international lenglet reportedly undergoing a medical in london. the -year-old is said to have stayed thursday night in tottenham's on-site hotel at the club's training facility. while ben davies was certainly a (surprising) standout performer as the left-sided center back in conte's back-three down the stretch last season, lenglet represents an upgrade in quality and his arrival instantly creates depth at a vitally important (and dangerous thin) position in tottenham's squad. as is the case all over the field, there will be plenty of games to go around -- in two condensed half-seasons either side of the world cup, with the five-substitutes rule once again in effect as well. (ae) it's official! antonio conte has added richarlison to an attacking group that already included harry kane, heung-min son, and dejan kulusevski. it's not a crazy profit for everton, who purchased richarlison from watford for $ million at the behest of manager marco silva, but the toffees need the money after risking financial fair play fouls. more, here. spurs aren't messing around in the transfer market this summer, are they? :studio_microphone: ""i\'m very happy to be here"" watch bissouma's first interview as a spurs player! :oncoming_fist: of course, he's smooth on the ball and has plenty of poise to his game too, but bissouma's arrival adds more steel to tottenham's team and more depth too as ivan perisic and fraser forster have already arrived this summer. daniel levy and fabio paratici are certainly delivering the additions conte wanted. this is a very savvy addition by spurs. with pierre-emile hojbjerg and rodrigo bentancur the first-choice pairing in central midfield and oliver skipp around too, conte now has four top quality options for his two central midfield spots. that will help a lot with rotating the lineup from champions league games in midweek to pl action at he weekend. (jpw) cameron carter-vickers spent the - season on loan to celtic, and he had a great time in scotland, where he made league appearances as the bhoys reclaimed the scottish premiership title from rivals rangers. celtic were so pleased with carter-vickers' loan spell that they made the transfer permanent and handed the usmnt center back a four-year contract.

" hello and welcome to another edition of our transfer newsletter, brought exclusively to you. it promises to be busy once again in the premier league as the likes of liverpool, manchester united and chelsea look to splash further millions in a bid to close the gap on arsenal and manchester city while those at risk of relegation will be in fear of the proverbial vultures preparing to swoop for their best players. manchester united's squad could be given a major overhaul in the summer under erik ten hag he has impressed when called upon, which is why arsenal want to hold onto winger reiss nelson. however, they face strong competition from brighton. the premier league leaders have opened talks over a new contract with the -year-old, who is a free agent in the summer, and were hopeful of an agreement, but his pathway to brighton's first team may be clearer. nelson has scored three goals in his four premier league appearances this season and is keen to kick on after two loan spells away. he had further interest from abroad but is understood to be attracted by staying in the premier league with brighton. reiss nelson is open to a move to fellow premier league side brighton & hove albion now he could be the best thing to come out of ireland since guinness but brighton are hopeful of agreeing a new contract with boy wonder evan ferguson before the end of the month - despite strong interest from manchester united and tottenham. roberto de zerbi says brighton are lucky to have the -year-old forward, who they picked up from irish side bohemians ahead of liverpool, and says he can become a 'european great'. it's true, towering teenager ferguson supported united as a boy and idolised wayne rooney, but the fact is that he is getting invaluable experience and playing time under de zerbi and sees no need to leave just yet. brighton know united also admire their midfielders moises caicedo and alexis mac allister and expect offers for those two from premier league sides this summer, but they have no desire to sell ferguson unless a silly figure is offered and will reward his progress with improved terms shortly. newcastle and chelsea also hold an interest in ferguson but brighton expect him to grow with them. evan ferguson has emerged as one of the most exciting talents at south coast side brighton manchester united are oiling the exit doors this summer as they look to move out up to players. there may be a bumper cash injection to come from new owners but they still need to reduce a bloated squad and stay on the right side of ffp guidelines. winger anthony elanga has over clubs keen to take him and he is ready for a fresh challenge while there are not too many surprises in who else will be allowed to follow. eric bailly has underwhelmed at marseille and the french side don't wish to make that move permanent. a PSm fee would have been triggered after league games but they are keen to send the -year-old back. harry maguire, aaron wan-bissaka, alex telles, donny van de beek, brandon williams and anthony martial all have question marks over their future too. amad diallo is likely to be given a first team chance following his spell at sunderland while facundo pellistri could go on loan for more experience once a new contract is wrapped up. united's new transfer negotiator matt hargreaves, who is joining from adidas, is sure to have plenty of opportunity to earn his stripes. erik ten hag is ready to wave goodbye to up to manchester united players this summer it seems liverpool may also be taking an interest in bristol city midfielder alex scott. west ham and wolves are already on his trail but liverpool's head of recruitment dave fallows and chief scout barry hunter were among the crowd to check on the -year-old as england under s faced germany last month. scott hasn't played since picking up a ligament injury on international duty the following weekend. bristol city starlet alex scott has attracted interest from multiple premier league clubs leeds united have joined borussia dortmund by following manchester city midfield prospect shea charles. the northern ireland international, , is highly thought of at city but first team competition is fierce, and they are keen to add more midfielders with dortmund's jude bellingham, brighton's alexis mac allister and gabri veiga of celta vigo on their list. city sold romeo lavia to southampton last summer and have a PSm buy-back option which becomes active next year. they want to keep local boy charles but know interest is building with dortmund, brentford and newcastle also monitoring developments. city also want a centre-back such as leipzig's josko gvardiol and a left-back but chelsea's ben chilwell, who was fancied, is discussing a new four year contract at stamford bridge. teenage talent isaac price has decided everton isn't right for him and is close to joining standard liege in belgium. the -year-old northern ireland international had a big admirer in former manager frank lampard but was out of contract this summer. he held talks over a new deal yet a cut-price compensation move to liege, home to many a famous belgian, honest, looks likely. isaac price is likely to leave everton this summer with the northern ireland star belgium bound everton, mindful they could also lose adama onana this summer, have checked on reims' midfield powerhouse dion lopy in recent weeks - but so have aston villa. dion lopy (left) is a transfer target for premier league sides everton and aston villa chelsea and crystal palace are the latest clubs to post interest in gambia striker adama bojang. he is so similar to the napoli man in style that the italian side are also in the mix along with tottenham and brighton's sister club union saint-gilloise. bojang, who plays for steve biko fc and is valued around PS,, would struggle for a work permit but clubs have discussed investing then loaning him out. adama bojang (left) of gambia has attracted interest from chelsea and crystal palace noise out of newcastle is that they are in no rush to negotiate new terms with allan saint-maximin. newcastle improved terms for striker callum wilson earlier this season and will look at other key performers' contracts towards the summer as they assess what budget is required for the next stage of their development. newcastle are in no rush over extending a deal for star forward allan saint-maximin it was perhaps fitting that chelsea's stamford bridge played host to football's equivalent of speed-dating last month when clubs across the globe sent representatives to meet up for the transfer room. the brainchild of jonas ankersen, it is where football figures gather to jump round tables for minutes with counterparts and share who is for sale, who is for loan or who is required. it's not everyone's cup of tea, mind. share what you think",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-04-10T13:24:05Z

" the red devils have enjoyed a strong season, winning the league cup and finding themselves in the quarter-finals of the europa league and final four of the fa cup. the campaign could finish even stronger, too, with the side within the top four in the final straight of the season. but upgrades look a necessity this summer in a number of positions, as erik ten hag looks to take his squad to the next level. ""he's a different sort of player, but axel disasi could be viewed as patrice evra mark two if he was to come from the same monaco pathway,"" jones said.

" and mbappe was not the only high profile target to appear on his radar, with a potential bumper transfer window on the horizon for the red devils. however, whatever optimism was generated by the rumour was perhaps stymied by the fact that the club's war chest will be limited to just PSmillion, due to financial fair play (ffp) constraints. as a result, a clear out of the squad will likely be required if the club are to invest heavily over the break - with a number of united stars potentially heading for the exit if sheikh jassim is to land his transfer targets. sheikh jassim bin hamad al thani is reportedly keen to land kylian mbappe from psg if he completes a massive PSbillion takeover of manchester united from the glazer family owners manchester united could be forced to sell several current squad members to finance the summer's potential business - with a reported maximum transfer budget of just PSmillion united's defence require urgent attention in the previous window, and the addition of martinez to the back four has provided much needed stability and tenacity at the heart of the defensive unit. the argentine world cup winner has formed a superb, solid central defensive partnership with raphael varane and when both are fit, there is no questioning their credentials. a player is needed to provide an upgrade on the likes of scott mctominay, fred and loanee marcel sabitzer - and the perfect candidate could be real madrid's eduardo camavinga. the -year-old has struggled to secure a regular starting spot in his favoured central midfield position this season, often being used as an impact substitute or at left-back. real madrid's midfielder eduardo camavinga (right) is another reportedly being targeted while bayern munich winger kingsley coman rounds off the three frenchman being eyed up with jude bellingham potentially joining aurelien tchouameni in a young midfield, plus the evergreen luka modric and toni kroos still going strong, camavinga may decide to leave for united - where a starting spot would be almost guaranteed. he and casemiro in a two-man partnership that would bring great stability and composure - with the french youngster also bringing athleticism going forward and an ability to break the lines. he is also handy cover at left back. another frenchman potentially joining could be bayern munich star kingsley coman, who could cost the club a further PSmillion. the -year-old right winger has only managed eight goals and seven assists for the bavarians this term, but would bring electric pace and silky footwork in attack in a sure upgrade to the current form of both jadon sancho and antony. the frenchman is undeniably among the world's greatest players - despite his tender age - and has often been linked with a departure from psg. as well as a hat-trick in the world cup final, and a converted spot-kick in the shoot-out, he has goals and nine assists this season - which goes some way to explaining his PSm valuation on transfermarkt. but there may have to be several sales to finance those buys and balance the books, with dean henderson (right), on loan at nottingham forest, one of those perhaps on the chopping block captain harry maguire (pictured) may also be sacrificed to comply with ffp regulations in midfield, fred, scott mctominay and donny van de beek are expendable, with their combined market values of PSm, as well as the PSm that transfermarkt suggest could be raised by selling jadon sancho and anthony elanga, bring the overall sum to PSm. share what you think",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-05-04T18:01:58Z

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low. (nm) de zerbi: ""caicedo is a good guy. we will see. we hope he stays with us but this question for the club and moises"":police_car_light: #bhafc #afc excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right? (jpw) :police_car_light: exclusive: chelsea board now in poland trying to reach verbal agreement with shakhtar for mudryk and hijack the deal! official bid ready close to EURm. :blue_circle: #cfc arsenal always been leading the race, in talks with shakhtar after d official bid. according to the latest report regarding arsenal's pursuit of mykhaylo mudryk, progress is being made as arsenal and shakhtar donetsk go back and forth over the transfer fee. $ million is the latest reported base fee, with another $ million expected in add-ons. (ae) the latest reports on mykhaylo mudryk to arsenal have arrived and although the gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the ukraine international winger has flown to turkey and gone on tour with them. shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and mudryk, , has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. he is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent. that said, a report from the daily express suggests that shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $ million and some compromises are being found. this all hinges on how much arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. the structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

(nm) :fire: feel the fire. :red_circle: @lisandrmartinez is ready to bring the heat to united.#mufc that came hours after atletico madrid president enrique cerezo said this about reports linking real madrid legend ronaldo with an audacious move to his former crosstown rivals: ""i've already said this several times, i don't know who invented the cristiano story but i'll tell you that it's practically impossible that he comes to atletico de madrid. rumors are rumors and they have to stay as rumors. if you keep on fuelling the rumors then eventually it will look like it's something real, which it's not."" blink and you'll miss him, but the video below shows cristiano ronaldo arriving at manchester united's training ground for the first time this summer. with just over a week to go until the new season kicks off, erik ten hag will sit down with ronaldo to discuss his plans and try to convince him to stay at united. jorge mendes, ronaldo's agent, was shown alongside him in the car and it was reported that sir alex ferguson also arrived at the carrington training base but our partners in the uk at sky sports say he was not involved in talks. ronaldo, , is running out of options for a move away this summer as bayern munich and chelsea both opted out of moving for the portuguese superstar. ronaldo reportedly wants to leave united in order to play in the uefa champions league. with anthony martial, marcus rashford and jadon sancho excelling as a front three in preseason for united, it may be tough for ronaldo to actually get into this new-look united side early in the season. but, after all, he is cristiano ronaldo and if eth convinces him to be a part of his plans, then surely he will play a big part in the - campaign. (jpw) :camera_with_flash: cristiano ronaldo and his agent jorge mendes arriving at carrington one way or the other, the cristiano ronaldo want-away transfer saga must be resolved at some point, and that point in time could come much sooner rather than later. according to a report from david ornstein, ronaldo is traveling back to england and expected to meet with man united executives as well as, eventually, new manager erik ten hag. the key line, from ornstein's report: (ae) an agreement has been reached for the transfer of lisandro martinez :red_circle:#mufc || @lisandrmartinez eriksen said the following about his arrival at old trafford: ""manchester united is a special club, and i cannot wait to get started. i have had the privilege of playing at old trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of united will be an amazing feeling. ""i have seen erik's work at ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. it is clear that he is a fantastic coach. having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, i am even more excited for the future. i still have major ambitions in the game, there is a huge amount that i know i can achieve, and this is the perfect place to continue my journey."" this is a superb free transfer from united and eriksen showed his quality in the second half of last season at brentford. his intelligence on the ball and ability to play in a variety of roles across midfield and attack will be invaluable for united. so too will his experience as united have a world-class midfielder ready to help make them tick. now, how will eth fit eriksen, bruno fernandes and potentially frenkie de jong into the same team? eriksen could play a slightly deeper role and at this stage of his career, that would be perfect for him to dictate the tempo of the game and help united keep the ball. (jpw) manchester united continue to head to the netherlands for their new players as ajax and argentina defender lisandro martinez is about to join. erik ten hag was a huge fan of martinez during his time at ajax and the versatile defender (he can play center back or left back) will be key in improving this united defense. with tyrell malacia already arriving, the left-sided of united's defense could have a totally new look this season. martinez was chased by arsenal for most of this summer but martinez has decided to join united to work with eth once again. (jpw) there had been four loans for andreas pereira since the brazilian joined manchester united's academy in , but the now -year-old looks set to leave old trafford for good. pereira is headed for fulham, according to reports, with approximately $ million coming back the other way from the newly-promoted side. he has just finished a year on loan to brazil's flamengo, having scored nine times with three assists after spending the previous year on loan to serie a side lazio. pereira had his busiest year at united before that, playing pl matches and cup matches in -. loans to valencia and granada predated that. (nm)  stop scrolling.:backhand_index_pointing_down: watch this. @t_malacia's first interview has landed :airplane_arrival::red_circle:#mufc || #welkomtyrell our partners in the uk at sky sports have confirmed that cristiano ronaldo, , has not arrived at manchester united's carrington training ground for the first day of preseason. why? the reports say there are 'family reasons' why ronaldo hasn't returned on time and that the club are happy with that reason and all is well. in reality, this slots in with ronaldo reportedly asking to be sold this summer if an acceptable offer arrives. he has just one year left on his contract but the club are apparently unwilling to sell him and plan on him being around this season. with united scheduled to fly to asia and australia for their preseason tour in the coming days, it is clear that ronaldo is having serious doubts about the erik ten hag era and wants a move. most of united's squad returned to training last week and other international players (aside from ronaldo) arrived on monday morning to being preseason. in the next few days we are about to find out if this saga will take another twist as reports suggest eth will sit down with ronaldo and try to work out any issues he has about the season ahead. (jpw) christian eriksen has agreed to move to manchester united in a big boost for new manager erik ten hag. according to david ornstein from the athletic, the danish playmaker has agreed to a three-year contract at old trafford. the free agent, , will now undergo a medical before linking up with erik ten hag's side. eriksen had been wanted by tottenham, brentford (where he spent the second half of last season on a short-term deal) and many others, but he's picked united who seem him as being key to ushering in erik ten hag's possession-based style. the fact eriksen came through the ranks at ajax will no doubt be helpful in totally understanding eth's methods and ushering in a new era at united. cristiano ronaldo has reportedly asked to leave manchester united if they receive a suitable offer for him this summer. ronaldo, , has been linked with moves to several top teams in recent weeks as doubts persisted over whether or not he would fit into the system of new manchester united manager erik ten hag. it appears those doubts could spell the end for ronaldo's second spell at manchester united. a report from the times states that ronaldo wants to leave united this summer as the report says he wants to return to play in the uefa champions league and challenge for trophies. napoli, chelsea, bayern munich and roma have been linked with a move for ronaldo in recent weeks. after this initial report came out, our partners in the uk at sky sports state that manchester united do not want to sell ronaldo and have no interest in letting him leave this summer. the legendary striker scored goals in all competitions for manchester united in their dire - season but despite his heroics in front of goal, many questioned if his playing style and personality had an overall negative impact on the red devils. even if he doesn't slot into erik ten hag's long-term plans, replacing his goals will be a huge issue and united's new manager may already have a big problem to solve. (jpw) premier league new boys nottingham forest have picked up a top quality goalkeeper on loan for the season. dean henderson, , has joined forest from manchester united in a straight loan deal. henderson previously excelled while on loan at sheffield united but he hasn't been able to claim the starting spot ahead of david de gea since returning to old trafford. henderson had plenty of interest and he will use this move to forest to try and earn a spot in gareth southgate's world cup squad as he will play week in, week out in the premier league. steve cooper and forest are making some impressive moves this summer as they aim to cement themselves as a top-flight club.

"- stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga, more (u.s.) napoli brought in more money from transfer fees than they spent last summer and, in effect, used the proceeds from the exit of veteran defender kalidou koulibaly to chelsea (EUR million) to add what are now regarded as two of the best players in europe -- winger khvicha kvaratskhelia (EUR.m) and defender kim min-jae (EUR.m). that helped transform them into a squad capable of running away with the serie a title, which they did. chelsea, meanwhile, became addicted to writing checks instead of actually building a team, spent more than EURm on talent acquisitions, and might end up with their worst premier league finish in years. the - season is almost in the books, and the engine of the next transfer season is revving up loudly in the background. now is a good time to reflect. who actually benefited from spending big? who nailed a thriftier approach? to look at this past year\'s winners and losers, let\'s break teams into four quadrants: two good and two bad. among the teams in europe\'s big five leagues, who spent big (in terms of transfer fee balance) and who didn\'t? who actually got better and who didn\'t? obviously, the transfer fee is only one of two numbers that matter -- the other being the salaries that teams are paying -- and not every move is made to pay off immediately. plenty of clubs build for the future. but with the urgency and non-stop nature of the transfer industrial complex, looking at immediate returns is relevant, especially considering how one great or terrible window can define your fortune for years to come.

(jpw) :camera_with_flash: cristiano ronaldo and his agent jorge mendes arriving at carrington one way or the other, the cristiano ronaldo want-away transfer saga must be resolved at some point, and that point in time could come much sooner rather than later. according to a report from david ornstein, ronaldo is traveling back to england and expected to meet with man united executives as well as, eventually, new manager erik ten hag. the key line, from ornstein's report: (ae) an agreement has been reached for the transfer of lisandro martinez :red_circle:#mufc || @lisandrmartinez eriksen said the following about his arrival at old trafford: ""manchester united is a special club, and i cannot wait to get started. i have had the privilege of playing at old trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of united will be an amazing feeling. ""i have seen erik's work at ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. it is clear that he is a fantastic coach. having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, i am even more excited for the future. i still have major ambitions in the game, there is a huge amount that i know i can achieve, and this is the perfect place to continue my journey."" this is a superb free transfer from united and eriksen showed his quality in the second half of last season at brentford. his intelligence on the ball and ability to play in a variety of roles across midfield and attack will be invaluable for united. so too will his experience as united have a world-class midfielder ready to help make them tick. now, how will eth fit eriksen, bruno fernandes and potentially frenkie de jong into the same team? eriksen could play a slightly deeper role and at this stage of his career, that would be perfect for him to dictate the tempo of the game and help united keep the ball. (jpw) manchester united continue to head to the netherlands for their new players as ajax and argentina defender lisandro martinez is about to join. erik ten hag was a huge fan of martinez during his time at ajax and the versatile defender (he can play center back or left back) will be key in improving this united defense. with tyrell malacia already arriving, the left-sided of united's defense could have a totally new look this season. martinez was chased by arsenal for most of this summer but martinez has decided to join united to work with eth once again. (jpw) there had been four loans for andreas pereira since the brazilian joined manchester united's academy in , but the now -year-old looks set to leave old trafford for good. pereira is headed for fulham, according to reports, with approximately $ million coming back the other way from the newly-promoted side. he has just finished a year on loan to brazil's flamengo, having scored nine times with three assists after spending the previous year on loan to serie a side lazio. pereira had his busiest year at united before that, playing pl matches and cup matches in -. loans to valencia and granada predated that.

(jpw) christian eriksen has agreed to move to manchester united in a big boost for new manager erik ten hag. according to david ornstein from the athletic, the danish playmaker has agreed to a three-year contract at old trafford. the free agent, , will now undergo a medical before linking up with erik ten hag's side. eriksen had been wanted by tottenham, brentford (where he spent the second half of last season on a short-term deal) and many others, but he's picked united who seem him as being key to ushering in erik ten hag's possession-based style. the fact eriksen came through the ranks at ajax will no doubt be helpful in totally understanding eth's methods and ushering in a new era at united. cristiano ronaldo has reportedly asked to leave manchester united if they receive a suitable offer for him this summer. ronaldo, , has been linked with moves to several top teams in recent weeks as doubts persisted over whether or not he would fit into the system of new manchester united manager erik ten hag. it appears those doubts could spell the end for ronaldo's second spell at manchester united. a report from the times states that ronaldo wants to leave united this summer as the report says he wants to return to play in the uefa champions league and challenge for trophies. napoli, chelsea, bayern munich and roma have been linked with a move for ronaldo in recent weeks. after this initial report came out, our partners in the uk at sky sports state that manchester united do not want to sell ronaldo and have no interest in letting him leave this summer. the legendary striker scored goals in all competitions for manchester united in their dire - season but despite his heroics in front of goal, many questioned if his playing style and personality had an overall negative impact on the red devils. even if he doesn't slot into erik ten hag's long-term plans, replacing his goals will be a huge issue and united's new manager may already have a big problem to solve. (jpw) premier league new boys nottingham forest have picked up a top quality goalkeeper on loan for the season. dean henderson, , has joined forest from manchester united in a straight loan deal. henderson previously excelled while on loan at sheffield united but he hasn't been able to claim the starting spot ahead of david de gea since returning to old trafford. henderson had plenty of interest and he will use this move to forest to try and earn a spot in gareth southgate's world cup squad as he will play week in, week out in the premier league. steve cooper and forest are making some impressive moves this summer as they aim to cement themselves as a top-flight club.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low. (nm) de zerbi: ""caicedo is a good guy. we will see. we hope he stays with us but this question for the club and moises"":police_car_light: #bhafc #afc excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

(ae) the latest reports on mykhaylo mudryk to arsenal have arrived and although the gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the ukraine international winger has flown to turkey and gone on tour with them. shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and mudryk, , has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. he is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent. that said, a report from the daily express suggests that shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $ million and some compromises are being found. this all hinges on how much arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. the structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

" tottenham have identified form bayer leverkusen and werder bremen chief tim steidten as a possible replacement for fabio paratici as the club's search for a sporting director continues, according to reports. levy is keen to bring in a new sporting director ahead of the summer transfer window, with the club falling behind their rivals this season and without champions league football for -. daniel levy (right) is keen to appoint a sporting director before the start of the summer transfer window the -year-old initially transitioned from a professional playing career in the german lower leagues to scouting, arriving at werder bremen in . he then left the bundesliga outfit in to become head of scouting at leverkusen, before departing the club just four years later. steidten is credited as having played a key role in the acquisitions of several young talents at the club, such as edmond tapsoba, jeremie frimpong and piero hincapie. the north london outfit are thought to be keen admirers of the young ecuadorian centre-back. roma's general manager pinto was linked with a similar position at rivals west ham, and has been working in the italian capital with former spurs boss jose mourinho. roma general manager tiago pinto works alongside former tottenham boss jose mourinho markus krosche is also of interest, although tottenham may face competition from bayern munich krosche, meanwhile, was reportedly connected with the vacant director role at liverpool, and is highly regarded throughout europe. so much so, that spurs may have a fight on their hands if they are to secure his services, with german titans bayern munich believed to be interested in his services. munn will effectively operate as levy's no at the club, and will return to work at the end of his gardening leave with city football group.",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-05-16T12:22:18Z

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low.

(nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

" ""play now men's brackets play now women's brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop twenty years on from his first european triumph, the jose mourinho template is still paying dividends. let the opposition have the ball. let them make the mistakes. bayer leverkusen were totally free to drive themselves to distraction at the stadio olimpico, a team eager to play the match at pace dragged into a turgid, tetchy affair they could never win. now mourinho finds himself minutes away from another european final with roma, a chance to go back-to-back with first conference league and then europa league. he will be the last person who needs reminding that he has never lost any of his previous five continental finals. he probably does not need telling that another european crown would give him more than pep guardiola, louis van gaal and zinedine zidane. on the basis of thursday's game, roma are eminently capable of progressing to budapest solely off the back of edoardo bove's snapped effort on the hour. they might have allowed leverkusen to have -plus percent of the possession but for minutes of this game, rui patricio had only a solitary save to make. roma spoiled, they clipped and they needled but their defense was diligent and they posed a continuous threat off set pieces. by the final whistle, they had left bayer leverkusen with a sense of bafflement and persecution, florian wirtz's sarcastic applause of the officials typical of the distraction to which mourinho can drive his opponents. it was not destined to go this way. early on leverkusen looked like they might have the guile to prise their hosts apart, their intricate play swiftly taking themselves ultimately they produced what might have been the best of the match inside the first minute, moussa diaby gliding from his perch on the right flank into midfield. florian wirtz took the attack on there, laying it wide to pierro hincapie. his cross to the edge of the box was met by a tame robert andrich effort, anything with a bit of ferocity might well have beaten patricio. wirtz was roma's cheap tormentor early on, beating three midfielders and combining with adam hlozek before rolling a shot wide of the near post. that seemed to be the prompt for mourinho to tighten up the defensive wall and though roma would occasionally press the leverkusen back three in a bid to force errors, they were more than prepared from then out to drop into a low block and challenge their visitors to charm a way to goal. it helped that the hosts carried by far the greater threat from set pieces, roger ibanez drawing a superb save from lukas hradecky off a lorenzo pellegrini free kick. roma were certainly prepared to play for dead ball opportunities and this game swiftly descended into a gritty affair where yellow cards were far more frequent than clear-cut shots on goal. as leverkusen pushed further forward, the gaps emerged for roma to dart through. a swift counter and tammy abraham found himself with his back to goal, spinning and clipping a well-struck shot towards the right corner. hradecky might have felt he could have done more than palm the shot straight back into a dangerous area with bove on hand to score his first european goal off the rebound. he might have had an extremely similar second soon after as hradecky parried an andrea belotti effort into the center of the penalty box. only once did the roma defense look like buckling, patricio spilling a regulation cross that landed at the feet of jeremie frimpong. bryan cristante was on hand to block on the line, his arms close enough to his chest that leverkusen appeals for a penalty were little more than the final prayer of a team who had only hope to cling to. come next week, mourinho will relish snuffing that out too.",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-05-11T21:21:55Z
"by kyle fansler may , mourinho's roma met alonso's bayer leverkusen in the first leg of the europa league semifinal on thursday. roma, which won the europa conference league a season ago, is looking for back-to-back european trophies. bayer leverkusen, on the other hand, is looking for its first since winning this competition in the / season. a tight tie between two teams fighting for europe domestically transpired. it was a tame first half between the two clubs at the stadio olimpico in rome. while both teams tried to feel out their opponent, there were not many clear-cut opportunities. the one man pulling the strings was florian wirtz for bayer leverkusen. in the seventh minute, wirtz had one of those opportunities to put the visitors in front. however, he pulled his shot wide of rui patricio in net. the best chance for the opposition was not long after. however, leverkusen shot-stopped lukas hredecky parried away a roger ibanez header on a roma set piece. despite a hollar of a penalty shout, that did not hold much weight, from andrea belotti, those were the best chances in the first . in a game of few opportunities, it had to be someone at the age of just to bring some life into the game. leave it to -year-old edoardo bove to get his first european goal in a semifinal. he won the ball in the middle of the park to set up a quick counter for roma. tammy abraham fired a shot at hredecky, who made a save. however, the italian bove pounced on the rebound and guided it into the leverkusen net. riding the euphoria in the crowd, roma hunted a second. bove tried to convert an acrobatic brace after lukas hredecky made a good save on a low shot from bellotti. that ball sailed over the crossbar into the italian crowd. as the game waned, bayer leverkusen tentatively pushed for an equalizer. however, with the constant threat of tammy abraham or substitute paulo dybala on the break, the german club did not devote all its players forward. bayer leverkusen almost took advantage of a major mistake at the back for roma. rui patricio collided with ibanez while collecting a cross. the ball fell to jeremie frimpong. the only thing that kept frimpong's shot out of the roma net was bryan cristante, who blocked the shot with his core to preserve the one-goal lead. that is the marginal edge roma will have to defend at bayarena next thursday. it successfully defended a first-leg win against real sociedad in the round of . bayer leverkusen will have to overcome a one-goal deficit as it did in the playoff stage against monaco, having lost at home, -, only to win the next game via penalties. includes: premier league + sports channels includes: bundesliga & la liga includes: champions league & serie a includes: premier league includes: every mls game and leagues cup world soccer talk (c) . made in florida. world soccer talk is reader-supported and may earn a commission through our partner links.'}",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-05-11T20:55:12Z
"play now men\'s brackets play now women\'s brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop roma: mourinho\'s men could scarcely have picked a worse moment to go off the boil, but since crushing feyenoord to reach the final four, roma have won none, drawn two and lost two. defeat to inter milan leaves the giallorossi three places and five points off champions league qualification, it may well be that their best chance of getting back to the big time now lies with winning this competition.

"play now men\'s brackets play now women\'s brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop his players would be the first to acknowledge that. ""when he first came we were all down,"" says jeremie frimpong. ""he had to lift the team up."" that he certainly did. seven months later and leverkusen\'s horizons are utterly changed. before friday\'s dispiriting - derby loss to cologne, alonso\'s men were undefeated in all competitions since feb. . they have risen from the bundesliga graveyard and find themselves in the sunlit uplands of the european places. they have left it too late for a charge into the top four but they may not need that to qualify for the champions league anyway. thursday brings with it the first leg of their europa league semifinal against roma (live on paramount+), a chance to add just a second continental trophy for a club that has a reputation for being the nearly men of german football. ""it would mean everything,"" says frimpong. ""i don\'t think leverkusen have won a trophy in a long while. it feels like it\'s time. we\'re a good team, we should win a trophy. hopefully, it\'ll be this one."" how has alonso done it? one of the most elegant playmakers and progressive ball players of his generation started with the most basic principles, shoring up a defense that was leaking . goals per game under his predecessor gerardo seoane. some of leverkusen\'s early season difficulties were the result of individual errors from otherwhile reliable performers, a little from finishing variance at both ends of the pitch, particularly some off form from the likes of patrik schick and moussa diaby. those foundations are looking solid. under alonso, leverkusen have allowed opponents two fewer shots per game and their expected goals (xg) allowed has dropped from . to .. per game. the . non-penalty xg per shot their opponents were taking before friday\'s defeat gave die werkself the best mark in the top flight. that is quite some achievement for a team who were hardly known for their resilience even last season. only now that the backline is secure has alonso loosened the strings. their scoring dried somewhat in recent weeks with both wolfsburg and union berlin holding on to earn - draws at home to leverkusen; in the five game bundesliga winning streak that proceeded they scored . they are also the leading scorers of the europa league knockout stages with in six matches, ""we started to build that up through the middle and then up front with more ideas,"" says wirtz. ""how could we break down our opponents on the attacking third? how could we best utilize our strengths?"" ""i think i am at the level i was at before, in some areas, maybe even playing a little better,"" he said. ""that was always the goal from the beginning of recovery -- to get the best out of the rehab and be as ready as possible. ""i didn\'t have any doubts at all that i would be able to play good football again. i remember being quite shocked when the diagnosis came in [after the injury] and i was determined just to look forward and make the best of the situation. there was a lot of work to be done -- a lot of different things to focus on -- but it was always looking ahead, keeping an eye on being on the pitch again. just give everything to be back in your position."" wirtz is flowing and so are leverkusen. witness the ease with which he breezed through the union saint-gilloise defense in the first leg of the europa league quarterfinal, five defenders collapsing into the same patch of turf and the youngster simply stepping into a low shot into the bottom left corner, a crucial goal that kept his side from having to overturn a deficit in belgium. even he has to acknowledge that ""it all feels really easy out there for the time being. roma boss jose mourinho might feel confident in coming up with a defensive scheme to slow down wirtz alone but what can he do when he\'s also coming up against a devastating right flank of frimpong and diaby? between them, these two have goals in all competitions, of which have, rather remarkably, come from wing-back frimpong. both players rank among the five quickest in the bundesliga this season; diaby just shading the two even though his teammate seems to think the difference is sizeable. ""he\'s faster than me. have i tested it? i just know,"" says frimpong with the air of a man who is really not inclined to get involved in one of the few foot races he might not win. that explosive movement rather frees them up to take whatever unorthodox position best tests the defenders. under alonso, frimpong, for instance, will on occasion drift into more inverted positions to supplement the threat he poses down the byline. diaby\'s touch map, meanwhile, looks nothing like that of a so-called right winger, even in games where, according to transfermarkt, he starts on that flank. if all their opponents have no idea how to stop leverkusen\'s dynamic right flank it is perhaps no surprise that frimpong is at a loss to explain it too. ""how would i stop us? i don\'t know to be honest. is it impossible? no, but i don\'t know, it\'s a very fast attack. i guess you\'ll have to figure it out."" good luck mourinho. the question that leverkusen may well face once their europa league race is run, however, is the same one that faces all but the dozen or so richest teams across the continent. how long can we keep this all together? diaby is wanted by newcastle and arsenal. frimpong has been linked with a move to work alongside compatriot erik ten hag at manchester united. as for wirtz, there isn\'t a top club in europe that doesn\'t want him with liverpool, manchester city and barcelona firm admirers. ""i\'m here in leverkusen. we have a good team. we have a young team. i have a lot of friends. i am just fully concentrating on my tasks here. i have some of my own personal goals to accomplish here in leverkusen so i\'m really not looking or thinking about other clubs and instead just proving out there that i can be the best player that i can be in each game and helping the team win games,"" he said. ""they\'ve helped big time, not just me but you can tell from our results and the way we play that they\'ve done the same for the whole team,"" says the dutch wing back. ""the coach has made a big difference and the staff, we\'re just really grateful to have them and hopefully he can keep us going."" wirtz added, ""he really shows, even in practice, how good he can still play. he has so much experience on the field as a player, he really knows how to carry himself and give the guidance we need so our team can reach its full potential and so all of us are at full capacity. he\'s really putting it on himself so that the team is really locked in mentally and focused but also that we are physically there in full as well. ""the atmosphere has been great. we\'ve really come together as a team. we\'re giving all we can to be successful with the team."" a squad of fearless, explosive young talent now has a boss of whom you could say the same thing. that leap of faith leverkusen took on alonso looks to be an inspired decision.",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-05-10T11:04:33Z

" ""after kicking off espn's college football future power rankings with quarterbacks, the series switches to the other side of the ball with the defenses. the biggest challenge here was assessing the lost production for perennial top defenses and how much, if at all, they will fall off. here's a look at last year's future power rankings for defense. now, for the latest rundown. future defense power ranking: scouting the bulldogs: one of the major curiosities entering last season was how georgia's defense would fare after losing a record five nfl first-round draft picks, several other notable players and coordinator dan lanning. the unit wasn't quite as dominant but barely dropped off in helping the team to its second straight national title. the bulldogs led the nation in rushing defense, ranked second in third-down efficiency and fifth in points allowed. they don't lose as much star power this season, although jalen carter is irreplaceable in the middle of the line, and standouts such as linebacker nolan smith and defensive backs christopher smith and kelee ringo also exit athens. georgia looks loaded at positions such as inside linebacker and safety. smael mondon and jamon dumas-johnson combined for tackles, including for loss (four sacks by dumas-johnson). free safety malaki starks and star javon bullard help anchor a secondary that also brings back starting cornerback kamari lassiter. carter leaves a massive void, but georgia's overall line depth is strong with sacks leader mykel williams as well as veterans nazir stackhouse, tramel walthour and warren brinson. there's some turnover at outside linebacker, but sophomore chaz chambliss is expected to emerge alongside second-year jalon walker, who also has worked inside. georgia also has overtaken clemson as the nation's premier defensive recruiting operation. the team's six highest-rated recruits for play defense, headlined by linebacker raylen wilson (espn's no. overall recruit) and safety joenel aguero (espn's no. overall). georgia also has commitments from four defensive recruits ranked in espn's top nationally, led by cornerback ellis robinson iv (no. overall). future defense power ranking: linebacker also looks strong with jeremiah trotter jr., a second-team ap all-america selection, leading the group alongside barrett carter, who earned first-team all-acc honors. the two combined for sacks and tackles for loss in . sophomore wade woodaz emerged last season and will take on an even bigger role, especially in . clemson will look to second-year players t.j. dudley and kobe mccloud to provide more depth. injuries hit clemson's secondary hard in , but there were some bright spots, such as safety jalyn phillips, who returns for his final year, and cornerbacks sheridan jones and nate wiggins. toriano pride jr. and jeadyn lukus, both sophomores, help the cornerback outlook beyond . safety andrew mukuba, the acc defensive rookie of the year in , will try to rebound from a disappointing season. clemson has nice depth at safety with senior r.j. mickens. the team also has two espn recruits committed for . future defense power rankings: scouting the wolverines: after a surprise breakthrough in , the entire michigan program showed it had staying power last fall, but especially the defense. the unit lost nfl first-round draft picks aidan hutchinson and daxton hill and second-round pick david ojabo, as well as coordinator mike macdonald. but michigan once again finished in the top in many categories, and it transitioned well from macdonald to jesse minter, a broyles award finalist who is back. key returning players include safety rod moore, lineman kris jenkins, linebackers junior colson and michael barrett, and cornerback will johnson, who blossomed late in his freshman year and will play at least two more seasons. defensive lineman mason graham is another key returnee who will play at least through . sophomore cornerback amorion walker drew strong reviews during spring practice and adds to a playmaking secondary that features moore, johnson, senior nickel mike sainristil, senior safety makari paige and others. future defense power ranking: scouting the tide: some might be surprised to see the tide not drop in these rankings, given the angst around their defense at times last season and the departures of star pass-rusher will anderson jr., safety brian branch, coordinator pete golding and others. but alabama has a chance to reestablish its dominance on defense, thanks to exceptional recruiting in and the return of veteran playcaller kevin steele to tuscaloosa. plus, the tide actually held up well last season, finishing ninth nationally in points allowed and th in yards allowed. let's start with who returns: alabama has several proven standouts in junior cornerback kool-aid mckinstry (team-high pass breakups in ) and linebacker dallas turner, who has . sacks and tackles for loss the past two seasons. if turner recaptures his form and boosts the pass rush along with others, including senior chris braswell, alabama should be in good shape for the short term. future defense power ranking: iowa's overall depth in the secondary actually might improve this fall as seniors quinn schulte and sebastian castro join nwankpa at safety, and dejean forms a solid cornerback tandem with jermari harris, who missed all of last season with injuries after recording four interceptions in . the hawkeyes also have plenty of options up front, even behind craig and evans at end with junior ethan hurkett. linebacker is by far the biggest short-term question, as iowa must build around senior jay higgins, who had tackles last season. the team added productive virginia transfer nick jackson. iowa's recruiting rarely pops nationally, but linebacker ben kueter, a four-time state wrestling champion, headlines the class. the team also has commitments from espn preston ries and four-star cam buffington. future defense power ranking: scouting the nittany lions: penn state is set up to push for its first big ten championship since , and much of the optimism around happy valley stems from who returns on defense. coordinator manny diaz had a solid first season and is back despite generating some interest for head-coaching vacancies. diaz's aggressive scheme suits returning players such as ends chop robinson and adisa isaac, and linebacker abdul carter, a national awards candidate who recorded . sacks, . tackles for loss and two forced fumbles as a true freshman. carter will help lead the defense through at least , and robinson is a true junior. linebacker u has an excellent opportunity to uphold its tradition with carter, curtis jacobs and kobe king, who are all experienced and boast multiple years of eligibility left. penn state actually has no seniors in its linebacker room and will lean on players such as junior tyler elsdon, who finished fourth on the team with tackles last season. future defense power ranking: future defense power ranking: scouting the badgers: a jarring season for wisconsin ended with luke fickell as head coach and defensive coordinator jim leonhard no longer with the team. fickell's arrival brought sweeping changes, but less so for a defense that has been on a strong trajectory. although the defense slipped a bit in , it still finished th nationally in points allowed and th in yards per play allowed. fickell's roots on defense run deep, and coordinator mike tressel has spent most of his career in the big ten at michigan state. they inherit a unit that loses standouts in linebacker nick herbig and nose tackle keeanu benton, but returns strong overall production at linebacker, defensive end and elsewhere. inside linebackers maema njongmeta and jordan turner combined for tackles, including . sacks and . tackles for loss. senior c.j. goetz anchors the outside linebacker group after a productive season, and there's good depth with sophomore darryl peterson and junior kaden johnson. future defense power ranking: not ranked the secondary projects as the unit's strength, especially in the short term. leading tackler trey taylor, a second-team all-mountain west selection last season, is back at safety alongside camby goff and jayden goodwin. the three combined for seven interceptions and pass breakups in . veteran cornerback eian castonguay ( tackles last season) is also back with jamari bellamy. air force will lose a lot in , although zdroik, bellamy and others are expected to return. freshman defensive end jack curtis stood out during spring practice and could be pegged for a bigger role after this coming season. future defense power ranking: scouting the wolfpack: nc state's defense has reached a level where drop-offs should be limited despite key personnel turnover. the wolfpack will miss all-acc selections drake thomas (linebacker) and tanner ingle (safety), but coach dave doeren and veteran coordinator tony gibson have enough back to sustain momentum. linebacker payton wilson's return for a sixth season gives nc state a proven leader for the unit. wilson has career tackles, including . for loss and nine sacks, as well as four interceptions. he'll be joined by senior jaylon scott, junior devon betty and younger players such as caden fordham. nc state returns an experienced line led by junior davin vann, who tied with wilson for second on the team in sacks (.) last fall. both vann and junior tackle c.j. clark could play through , while senior end savion jackson has started parts of the past three seasons. nc state added end red hibbler, espn's no. junior college transfer, as well as cincinnati transfer noah potter for short-term depth. sophomore end travali price should continue to blossom. future defense power ranking: future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the illini: the illinois defense seemed to be trending well after , but few expected the spike that would follow last season. illinois led the nation in fewest points allowed and ranked in the top in all the major statistical categories. the unit produced all-america cornerback devon witherspoon and other standouts, and coordinator ryan walters was a broyles award finalist before taking the purdue head-coaching job. witherspoon and walters are both gone, alongside all-big ten defensive backs sydney brown and jartavius martin, who combined for nine interceptions and pass breakups. but illinois received a big boost up front when jer'zhan newton and keith randolph jr., who combined for sacks and tackles for loss, both returned for the season. the illini will need to build around them and prepare for , as players such as terah edwards and bryce barnes step into bigger roles. future defense power ranking: not ranked cody lindenberg moves into minnesota's lead linebacker role following sori-marin's departure, and he should headline the group through at least the season. the gophers added western

" ""hertha were motivated and applied themselves well against city rivals union. the problem was the result it was always going to be aesthetics and so it proved. the importance of the eighth top-flight derby between hertha and union was everywhere you looked, not least in the sold-out stands of the olympiastadion, such a contrast to the relatively paltry turnout for wednesday's humiliating hammering for hertha at the hands of wolfsburg. the problem was that, even at such an early stage of this as an elite-level rivalry, we already knew which way this was going and so it proved. hertha's coach, sandro schwarz, suggested before the game the result didn't matter as much as the performance, trying to take any unnecessary drama out of the moment, which succeeded and failed at the same time. the performance was the necessary riposte to the wolfsburg debacle. hertha were motivated and applied themselves well. the problem was the result. in fact, the problem was union. they are too polished, too canny these days to need the performance of a lifetime to win a game like this. hertha probably shaded the first half and then union scored a typical set piece a minute before the break, with danilo doekhi (again) soaring to power home a christopher trimmel free-kick (again). ""we were clinical,"" was how the union coach, urs fischer, put it. this is what they do on a weekly basis. hertha, it seems, was just another match for them. even if hertha did as well as might have been expected in the circumstances, something had to happen and happen it did. the announcement of the removal of the sporting director, fredi bobic, was made shortly after the match, but again it was a matter of timing and appearances. minds had already been made up. ""it wasn't,"" said the president, kay bernstein, on sunday, ""a kneejerk reaction."" bernstein was introducing bobic's replacement, a real herthaner in benjamin weber, who fulfilled a number of roles at the club over almost two decades (including academy director) until leaving last year. weber will be assisted by andreas ""zecke"" neuendorf, another familiar face at the club. ""i'm from berlin, i'm from hertha,"" said weber with insistence and passion. ""i'm really excited to be coming back to my club and i'm dying to get going and tackle the challenges."" bernstein explained how bobic had arrived at a club ""under different circumstances"", with major investor lars windhorst about to sell his stake after an unsuccessful tenure incorporating hundreds of wasted millions of euros and several fallouts with major figures at the club (his shares will go to us investment firm partners, pending bundesliga approval). reduced means will be part of the future, but if bobic doesn't suit the new vision, you could say the same of some of the players, bought with much bigger ambitions in mind than avoiding the drop. this was another useful, if unwelcome, reminder that union - with their stability and sensible building - are a blueprint to be copied. the insistent chant of ""stadtmeister! stadtmeister!"" [city champions] had rung from the away end at full-time with the same insistence as the bank of red flares had burned bright from the same section earlier in the afternoon, oblivious to the pleas over the pa to desist. the mood in the capital, on both sides, is like a tidal wave, impossible to turn back. kick off your evenings with the guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion we can now say that no team has taken more bundesliga points than leipzig since the arrival of marco rose on the bench, after the - win over stuttgart, authored by dominik szoboszlai's spectacular double. the downside came with a thigh muscle tear for dani olmo that will keep him out of action for several weeks. added to the continued absence of christopher nkunku, rose's attacking options are diminishing for the champions league meeting with manchester city. dortmund added their third (and most impressive) win out of three since the resumption, which came with a bonus clean sheet at leverkusen in sunday's late game. gregor kobel, as always, did his bit to earn that - with one particularly outstanding save from moussa diaby - but bvb felt more organised than has been habitual. edin terzic was quick to point out the options given to them structurally by a first start for sebastien haller, who helped to create the under-fire karim adeyemi's first bundesliga goal, after which he looked mightily relieved. dortmund retake a place in the top four. after a promising start at borussia monchengladbach things had been tougher for daniel farke of late, with two defeats to restart the campaign - not to mention the prospect of a number of players with expiring contracts and the stalwart goalkeeper yann sommer having already left for bayern. what better to lift morale, then, than a first away win of the season, - at hoffenheim? jonas hofmann got them off to a first-half flyer with two of the most jonas hofmann-esque goals you'll ever see him score, meeting farke's demand for ""more attacking investment"". hoffenheim, winless in eight and sinking fast, will hope to be boosted by the loan arrival of thomas delaney from sevilla.""}",moussa diaby,en,2023-01-30T12:47:22Z

(nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low. (nm) de zerbi: ""caicedo is a good guy. we will see. we hope he stays with us but this question for the club and moises"":police_car_light: #bhafc #afc excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right? (jpw) :police_car_light: exclusive: chelsea board now in poland trying to reach verbal agreement with shakhtar for mudryk and hijack the deal! official bid ready close to EURm. :blue_circle: #cfc arsenal always been leading the race, in talks with shakhtar after d official bid. according to the latest report regarding arsenal's pursuit of mykhaylo mudryk, progress is being made as arsenal and shakhtar donetsk go back and forth over the transfer fee. $ million is the latest reported base fee, with another $ million expected in add-ons. (ae) the latest reports on mykhaylo mudryk to arsenal have arrived and although the gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the ukraine international winger has flown to turkey and gone on tour with them. shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and mudryk, , has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. he is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent. that said, a report from the daily express suggests that shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $ million and some compromises are being found. this all hinges on how much arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. the structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

"football @ghostgoal but others wondered whether it was worth the gamble. a coach with no top-flight experience taking over a team still in the champions league but only one place off the bottom of the bundesliga. a first relegation was a real fear for leverkusen. a mixed start only added to the doubters outside the club but alonso went on to lead leverkusen to five league wins in a row either side of the world cup. beat ferencvaros over two legs and they will be into the quarter-finals of the europa league, too. for simon rolfes, the club\'s long-time midfielder turned sporting director, a decision that had seemed optimistic is now being seen as imaginative. speaking to him in an office at the bayarena, he insists that he had to trust his instincts when it came to alonso. ""maybe it would have been different if there were three games left of the season. that would have been a different situation because you do not have any time. but it was only eight games into the season. with the world cup break, we had time to improve."" improvement was certainly needed. despite finishing third under swiss coach gerardo seoane last season, leverkusen had endured their worst start to a season since the club had been first promoted to the bundesliga in . relationships had disintegrated. get sky sports live football on sky bundesliga table bundesliga fixtures please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player it was a hunch, really. alonso has been a world-class player, a champions league winner and a world cup winner. he had played under the greatest managers of his era. but his senior coaching experience was limited to a spell with real sociedad\'s reserves. ""you could analyse the style of play there but not with a lot of data,"" admits rolfes. ""it is different, for sure. but it was not a problem that he had no experience. after all, nobody has any experience at the start. in the end, it is all about the person. ""i had good information because he played with guys i know. he was always consistent as a player and a person. he is a big thinker. always concentrated, always thinking about how we can improve and solve situations. that was obvious. he understands the game."" - : real sociedad - : liverpool - : real madrid - : bayern munich the hope was that his time at bayern munich would help him to adapt. rolfes talks of ""a german mentality"" to alonso. while the fact that his only experience had come with young players was seen as a positive. ""there is no other choice for our head coach,"" he adds. ""our playing style, that is our dna. very offensive, very technical. you see it in our youth teams. we have the technical guys and try to give them more time to develop. that is strongly in the roots here - to believe in young players and give them time. callum hudson-odoi is one of those young internationals. on loan from chelsea, he was a four-year-old boy when alonso\'s goal for liverpool in the champions league final against ac milan helped to complete the comeback of all comebacks. ""i think it is massive for the club to have someone who has won it all when he was playing football. it is big,"" hudson-odoi tells sky sports. and he can still play. ""he has still got a bit about him, trust me. in training, you see him do a bit. i think he still could."" please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player alonso made a swift impression. ""when he first came, i think you could see straightaway in the first game how he wanted to play and how he wanted to push the boys and everything. he is a very good person off the pitch and a very good manager as well. ""he wants to play with energy and intensity. as an attacker, he just tells me to always be a problem, make sure you are causing problems for the defence. whether it is running in behind or coming to feet, whether it is shooting or whatever, just always be a threat. it is nice to have that push, to know that he has faith in you to do that. ""there are times when he will shout just to get his point across or you can see on the pitch that he is demonstrating what he wants us to do. it just shows the passion that he has and he is determined to get his point across and help the team."" rediscovering the right style of play for leverkusen has been a challenge. as one might expect of a player who enjoyed success with spain and under guardiola at bayern, alonso\'s instinct is to want the ball. his side rank fifth for possession in the bundesliga. but finding the patterns can be elusive in a league noted for its transitions and a group of players whose most obvious weapon is their pace. though florian wirtz favours the intricate, jeremie frimpong and moussa diaby prefer to have space to run into. ""we have a lot of offensive power in the squad and we want to get back to that,"" says rolfes. ""but you always have to see that style of play in context. if you are in the relegation positions and our players are not used to being there, that impacts your psychology. ""you have to play in another way, be compact. these are fundamentals. you can build from that. we have fast players so if we are compact and work hard then we can beat teams on transition. but for sure we want to build the house again. that is a process."" alonso is the man tasked with the rebuild. it will take time but only the top four in the bundesliga have won more games in the competition since his arrival and thanks to their come-from-behind win over monaco, their european adventure continues. indeed, rolfes is even more sure now than when he brought him in. ""his impact is not a surprise. but it is similar to with players, you make decisions but you never know. with players, at least you see them play. as a head coach, you always have to analyse events on the pitch and then draw conclusions back to the coach."" so, what has he seen on the pitch? ""we want to get as far as possible in the europa league. in the bundesliga, seventh place will be the first european place and we are behind. that bad start is done. you can see that in the table. but we have to focus on the process. we have to go step by step. ""it has been a good first step. we will try to build on that."" another saturday, another chance to win PS, with super . play for free, entries by pm.

celta vigo in may - - with man utd - and real betis this season - a - defeat.ben grounds sevilla vs fenerbahce, kick-off pm when you think of the europa league, you think of sevilla. the spanish side have won the competition six times, whereas no other team can lay claim to more than three titles. but when assessing the likely winners this season, it's hard to make the case for jorge sampaoli's outfit adding to their record haul. after entering as laliga title contenders thanks to a strong start to last season, sevilla drifted away during the second half of the campaign under current wolves manager julen lopetegui, and their struggles grew this term to such an extent that lopetegui was dismissed amid the prospect of a relegation battle. sampaoli - the bald-headed, tattooed bundle of anger and energy that oversaw argentina's chaotic world cup campaign - was brought in to spark a revival that hasn't properly materialised. after eight wins in games following the world cup, sevilla have drawn one and lost three of their last four matches, and find only goal difference separating them from laliga's relegation zone. a return to europa league action will perhaps provide a welcome distraction from their domestic toil, while even triggering memories of happier times. on the other hand, a failure to eliminate fenerbahce will only increase the darkness that is closing around sampaoli and his underperforming side.joe shread juventus vs freiburg, kick-off pm historically, the gulf is vast. juventus are two-time champions of europe. freiburg are into the last of european competition for the first time. but the german side are fifth in their table while their illustrious opponents are eighth in theirs. this will be interesting. speaking to freiburg goalkeeper mark flekken, it is a moment that he has been waiting his whole career for. until he joined freiburg in , aged , the dutchman had not even played top-division football let alone competed in europe. his story sums up this team. they are not superstars but they do have a plan. juventus must watch out for set-pieces and they will need to be organised and together - because their opponents will be. freiburg, the team from the black forest guided by christian streich, are a club united. with smart recruitment and a rare togetherness, freiburg face juventus with confidence as they chase champions league football ""they put a very big value on character,"" says flekken.

" ""play now men's brackets play now women's brackets an nfl draft podcast see who to add and drop kingsley coman set bayern on their way to their - aggregate success over psg with former cult favorite eric maxim choupo moting adding further insult to injury as the germans triumphed with more french representation in their ranks than the championnat leaders themselves. it is a lesson that psg need to learn to avoid further talent leaving the club and later coming back to haunt them -- more often than not on the european stage. warren zaire emery is the latest gem off the academy production line and although he was put in the shade here by a clinical kalimuendo as well as the sublime pairing of desire doue and lesley ugochukwu, he is destined to be a future star. this situation with the -year-old striker was always on the cards given how sharp he looked during preseason after two loans spells with rc lens -- who he shone for in ligue -- and the fact that he was sold anyway because he was one of few psg players clubs were prepared to pay for last summer. kalimuendo's replacement hugo ekitike has struggled after joining from stade de reims on an initial loan with a buy obligation conditioned to champions league qualification -- as evidenced by the fact that he only came on after minutes and looked as devoid of confidence as ever. things are more acute than ever now, though, with lionel messi and sergio ramos' contracts running out and another summer makeover needed with an already bloated wage bill to trim. this sort of limp showing in defeat against rennes underlined why psg would be right to move forward with quality from within their own academy than buying in more star power moving forward. despite boasting mbappe, messi, ramos, and neymar, champions league success is more elusive than ever yet the only solution seems to be getting more star heavy with each passing year to no real avail. since the bayern setback there has been increased recognition that something more substantial than last summer's semi overhaul is required and it could be the youth academy which ultimately points the way forward. with an impressive campus under construction in nearby poissy which will further aid the production of fantastic young talent, all of the ingredients are there to put such a blueprint into place now. it might feel like the ceiling is falling in on psg right now after a seventh defeat of -- two of those being to rennes -- but those still concerned by the soccer goings-on at parc des princes should also see this as an opportunity. the ownership needs to wake up after almost years of minimal progress on the continental scene at substantial cost and realize that the solution has been under their noses the entire time. there is no guarantee that this happens. in fact, if anything, recent history suggests that none of us should hold our breath.",moussa diaby,en,2023-03-19T18:32:45Z

"the bundesliga fluctuations in munich this season are so frequent and so wild that it cannot help but invite scrutiny it may have taken a double save from the unpredictable hradecky late on to deny leroy sane then alphonso davies, but leverkusen had not stolen this. they were the better team and not just that, they had controlled the key moments of the game better. if some have cast alonso in a similar role to steven gerrard at aston villa, forging an apprenticeship before meeting destiny and taking the top job at his old club after reaching maturity (a perception not publicly discouraged by the bayern top brass), the way the story has decanted has been quite different. if alonso's fledgling managerial career should be considered with more reserve, the initial results are extremely positive, especially when considering he took over a side battling the drop that were (at least on paper) not particularly well equipped for that sort of challenge. the feeling within the club is that alonso's skill in communication has been the key, getting his ideas across to the players quickly and clearly. this sort of clarity is something we expect from nagelsmann. ""if we combine maximum hunger and passion with the quality that we have, then we can achieve anything,"" he said afterwards, yet for a man of such insight and intelligence, the coach is in danger of stating the absolute obvious. this is clear and it would be surprising to few if bayern came out all guns blazing to face dortmund and if they found the fire to dismantle their opponents. but this cycle of action and reaction is not just familiar bayern narrative; it is familiar bayern narrative that predates nagelsmann. and if we know the script so well from years past it must pose the question - how much are bayern actually progressing under their widely admired coach? the fluctuations in bayern this season are so frequent and so wild that it cannot help but invite scrutiny. they may well provide a response against dortmund, but it seems unlikely to be a definitive answer. dortmund had taken the leadership on saturday with an impressively efficient - rout of okoln (""we were ice-cold in front of goal,"" as mo dahoud put it). two goals from marco reus took him past the -mark for the club and a brace from sebastien haller was also welcome. what's more is that after a couple of taxing weeks they might get back some missing personnel for the visit to munich, with emre can, karim adeyemi, youssoufa moukoko, salih ozcan and julian brandt all absent for this game. leipzig's week, meanwhile, went from bad to worse as they slipped to defeat at lowly bochum, following their champions league hiding in manchester by dropping out of the top four. marco rose raged at erhan masovic's winner from christopher antwi-adjei's long throw. ""we talked about it and we still can't defend it,"" he complained. meanwhile, union followed their european exit with a - win over freefalling frankfurt which lifted them back up to third. it's still all happening at the bottom, where a fourth successive scoring game for marius bulter rescued a point for schalke at augsburg, while a first win for hoffenheim under pellegrino materazzo - over hertha - saw them leapfrog their opponents, who fall into the playoff position.

" ""ireland france ireland's chiedozie ogbene takes on theo hernandez of france during the euro qualifier another night of international football in dublin where the early raucous roar of the home crowd was replaced by a sigh and acceptance of a predictable irish fate. because, once again, the home side took the notion of hospitality and openness to the extreme, gifting france the one opening they needed to carve their knife into the irish heart and drive home the advantage with a - win for a france side who may have otherwise had to settle for a draw. but that key goal did come from an irish error, josh cullen playing a pass just outside his own box to present possession to benjamin pavard who slammed home only the third goal of his -cap career. the outcome gave weight to the theory that france will win this group but with more displays like this from ireland, and a more clinical edge to cut out errors like cullen's gift to pavard, ireland will have a big say. this was not an even playing field: the ireland starting xi had six players who play their club football outside of the top flight, the french team had six starters whose clubs are still in contention to win the champions league. but players like chiedozie ogbene and jayson molumby made light of their lowly club status and left the field with reputations enhanced and the fact that france had to wait until the th minute for their first shot on target says a lot. given that france had the game at home to holland last week wrapped up after eight minutes with a two-goal lead, getting to the midway point of the first half without conceding would have been seen as an achievement for kenny's men. in fact they headed off for the sanctuary of the half-time break with gavin bazunu's goal intact. maybe the playlist for the night was set up by one early track, a french attack on eight minutes. it had bits of what make france great and frustrating, and the way ireland dealt with the danger was a welcome change from the open door policy at lansdowne road, a ground which saw the last three visitors each score two goals. it was a sweet french move, a delicious ball over the top from dayot upamecano, a touch in the box by mpappe but bazunu made the right call by coming out to challenge, he forced mbappe off course and collins cleared. bazunu was needed on minutes, saving an olivier giroud header from griezmann's corner. with so much congestion in the squeezed middle of the park, ireland looked for joy out wide, ogbene giving theo hernandez more bother than would be expected in a battle between a player from ac milan and rotherham, while matt doherty was also a force down the left. the pity from the home side's viewpoint was that their corner kicks were not properly used, cullen's delivery into the box easily dealt with by that towering partnership of ibrahima konate and upamecano. ireland had one chance on minutes when dara o'shea had an opportunity when a cullen corner came his way via john egan, but eduardo camavinga got there to snuff out the threat. there was no panic from the french at this unexpected state of affairs and, sure enough, just four minutes into the second half came their goal, from an adrien rabiot pass which cullen intercepted but then gifted to pavard. ireland could have responded on minutes with their best opportunity of the night, a burst down the wing by the impressive ogbene and a cross to knight, but he took one touch too many and gave griezmann the time he needed to put in a block. bazunu made strong saves from sub moussa diaby and rabiot, but this irish side did not lie down and a triple substitution on minutes, and a tactical switch which saw coleman move inside to give space out wide to sub alan browne, injected some life into kenny's team. james mcclean's first act was a poor corner kick which went right to the head of griezmann but mcclean was a threat, one shot into the side netting while browne also fired in a shot which was just wide, and then in the closing seconds of normal time came the header from collins, a world-class stop to deny the centre-half, the visitors then resorting to time-wasting. the points were secured by france but this was a point made by ireland. ireland: bazunu; o'shea (browne ), collins, egan; coleman, knight (johnston ), molumby (obafemi ), cullen, doherty (mcclean ); ogbene, ferguson (idah ).",moussa diaby,en,2023-03-27T20:37:20Z

" ""by matthew placzekspecial to fox sports dublin -- france had to fight to the finish to secure a - victory over the republic of ireland on a frigid night at aviva stadium on monday. here are three thoughts on the euro qualifying action from dublin: . luck was not in ireland's favor stephen kenny's side came within fingertips of stealing a point from france. after watching the netherlands demonstrate how one shouldn't play against france, ireland took the pitch with a sound game plan. les bleus love to push their fullbacks high and wide to punish opponents on the wings, so ireland's --- became a -- on defense to shore up those holes. the two attacking mids, chiedozie ogbene and jason knight, pushed out wide as the first layer of defense against theo hernandez and benjamin pavard. matt doherty and seamus coleman dropped behind their teammates as cover, and the wide irish center-backs marked kylian mbappe and randal kolo muani on the wings. add in john egan's exceptional man-marking of olivier giroud, and france failed to register a single shot on goal in the first half. unfortunately for ireland, the evan ferguson who took the pitch against france was not the evan ferguson who scored wednesday. the brighton man was ineffective up top as a sole striker and only touched the ball times, far less than the that he earned against latvia. ferguson lost both of his aerial duels and didn't take a single shot all night, becoming the first player subbed off for the boys in green in the th minute. it was a tough night for the -year-old, but his ineffectiveness is just one piece of a much bigger attacking question that kenny must solve before the next batch of qualifiers. there are five center-forwards on this irish squad. if ferguson can't hold up play well enough as a sole striker, then try to pair him up with any of the other four in a --. the bulk of ireland's chances came in the final minutes as substitutes (and center-forwards) adam idah and michael obafemi advanced forward without fear. that drive needs to be present for an entire match if ireland are to improve on this performance. . france hangs on -- but barely on friday night, france demolished a team that made it to the world cup quarterfinals. on monday, the french were outclassed by a team that failed to qualify. after witnessing his side's struggle to attack in the first half, there was no tactical change from didier deschamps coming out of the break. france continued to aimlessly swing the ball around its backline without any idea of how to cut through ireland's back five. when the french did get the ball into the midfield, they ruined their advantage in numbers by playing multiple passes out of play or into the opponent's feet. adrien rabiot, eduardo camavinga and antoine griezmann combined for a woeful incomplete passes over the course of minutes. by the time moussa diaby was introduced in the th minute, all of the momentum had swung in ireland's favor. the french might have had the lead, but they spent the final minutes on their heels as the irish pummeled them with counter attacks and set pieces. deschamps should have used one or two substitutions on attacking players to try to force ireland back toward their own goal, but he doubled down on defense by sending in jules kounde and tchouameni. eventually, france will come across a team in this competition that has enough talent on both sides of the ball to take the world cup champions down. it won't happen in group play with greece or gibraltar, but there is one team in europe that is on its own run of impressive results and could stand in france's way to a title in germany next summer. after their defeat at the world cup at the hands of les bleus, gareth southgate and england should be licking their chops with the potential for a revenge match at euro . . benjamin pavard only scores screamers after sitting on the bench for france's last seven games, pavard was one of three changes to deschamps' starting xi as kounde received a much-deserved rest. not one to shy away from the moment, pavard rewarded his coach's decision with one of the best goals of euro qualifying so far. in the th minute, ireland's cullen intercepted a weak pass from rabiot at the top of the box and turned to play knight. what should have been a simple, five-yard pass found its way onto pavard's feet. the fullback took one touch forward with his right foot before unleashing a cracking strike that left gavin bazunu and the rest of aviva stadium in shock. it was pavard's third goal of his french career and remarkably similar to the first he scored at the world cup. in a knockout stage match against argentina, the bayern munich defender met a bouncing cross with the purest of strikes on the half-volley to score an absolute gem. his shot monday didn't have as much curl, and it wasn't as close to the top bins, but it was world-class nonetheless. top stories from fox sports:""}",moussa diaby,en,2023-03-27T22:57:31Z

'i thought i had done everything right. i went as high as i could, i put power on it, but it was an incredible save.' 'he was a very hard-working goalkeeper,' dehon, now coaching at nice, remembered. 'he liked the challenge and variety in training sessions. he asked for advice, he was very respectful. i had a father-son relationship with him. 'one day after a session where i wasn't happy with his work i did a second work/ second recovery exercise. 'for this, i took claude makalele to be the shooter. it was a punishment but he didn't give up.' regardless of the reputation of the player he was facing. dehon continued: 'he was a complete goalkeeper who came out of the training centre. he had impressive mental strength and was not afraid to face players like zlatan ibrahimovic or edinson cavani. 'he was often put in as a player when we had games without a goalkeeper and he didn't look out of place. 'when you train with great players everything goes faster and he had this ability to adapt. he was quicker in his reaction time. 'against the great players of psg he stopped all the shots. he challenged these great players and often won. then i said to myself that he was going to be a great goalkeeper.' though not one psg were able to retain. 'with his personality and ambition i knew he would succeed in his clubs,' dehon said. the french shot-stopper (orange top) has been in terrific form for ac milan so far this season 'at psg it wasn't easy because there were very good goalkeepers in the hierarchy. he had done six months in the reserve team and at the end of the season he had me meet his agents to tell me he had been through the reserve team and wanted to leave. 'i explained to him that he had to be patient because he had only played six months in the reserve team. he stayed for another year and to see him leave after that was my biggest heartbreak but the door was closed for him at psg.' he eventually took over from vincent enyeama and went on to be crowned france's goalkeeper of the year in . now, at international level, it is lloris's long-held position in france's goal that he is now filling. very well, collins will testify.",moussa diaby,en,2023-04-12T12:42:21Z

against city has come from the fa cup and on that night we had trossart,vieira,tierney,nkettiah rob holding all starting while city had their full squad but we played so well that city managed a one nil victory, what i saw that night was a team set up to man mark city players all over the pitch and they struggled to the extend gadiola had to change tactics in the game, the point was the team had what they needed to cross the line but was let down by the manager tactically and squad management skills, last year we experienced same lost in a row went to stanford bridge with a back and got the win at this point of the season, it's not about principles, it's not about dominant football, it's about points this is called the business end of the season when everyone is fighting, city didn't do much against fulham yesterday other than grab the points, it's not about trying a flirk, skills or showing that you are the best team, it's about going out there and bringing the points by any means thats what it's all about at this time of the season if that has been in our managers mind we would not have lost all these points we recently dropped from a position of strength it was arsenals to lose. but naivety crept in. we play same style as city, only thing is they are better at it. so when meeting them, change tactics to defensive and counter attacks, but the manager thought we could match them boy to man. leading two against west ham and continue to play as if the game is still nil/nil. i would say the manager could have done better with game management. he failed the test his only win against city was in an fa cup we just played on the counter and won, that's what i admire about madrid they play in any way that gives them the w at the end of the day history only remembers the winners.. there is nothing wrong in knowing ur teams weakness and playing to their strength, if the players available have shown they can't play the way you want then play to their strength, till everyone is back every team is looking to exploit opposition weaknesses you are right. history only remembers the winner. history could have remembered us as / pl champions and not we top the table for most weeks. are we into the cl to be eliminated and fall back to europa league? i would still prefer the pl trophy. you are right gun down. poor game management. it's all about points not style. if you are leading up. change tactics immediately and use defensive plus counter attacks. you are absolutely right. arsenal made a formidable start to the season. we took the lead in the table. when the league resumed after the wc break, everybody was concernbed about how we would cope, when starting up again, and we would be without jesus. again we stood up to the pressure, and just kept going. it is because the progress is built on a solid foundation laid over the past couple of years, and there is every chance, we can do well again in the coming years. yes, more can be expected next season from the likes of liverpool and chelsea. but, every season is always the same. some ""big"" teams will underperform, also next year. we are, where we are in our own right and not because others have faltered. arsenal behind the league champion since .: / # chelsea, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. / # liverpool, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind there's no doubt that we have almost closed the gap, and i believe our progression will continue next season :red_circle: sorry, i forgot the / season. # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. there is no divine right that we wouldn't fall + points behind the winner next time or win it, ask liverpool, it's hard to predict the future the one the that we should be worried about is how we trow the top away last season and proberbly learned nothing this season by proberbly trowing away the title again in similar fashion... well, i don't believe we will be + points behind next season. we have a young team with potential to get better, and i'm sure we will recruit more quality players next summer. liverpool have and old team and haven't been clever enough with their recruitments lately. we are not throwing away anything but have to realise that other clubs are stronger. man.city has still a much better squad than us, but we are getting closer. personally i don't like deficit mentality, man city been better than us is not the reason we are failing, tell me the difference between the way we are failing now and what happened last season, it's almost similar fashion when the team needed help the manager failed them, do you believe that even next season we will be better than season? i never thought we were going to win the league this season, which i have said many times. why do man.city win the league year after year and reach the semifinal or the final of cl almost every year. man.city is probably the best team of the world and they bought the best striker in the world to make them better, and he has already made goals for them this season. last season we finished the season with points, now we have and still five games left. well it's your opinion and some valid point there too... one can also argue that it's not always about the players maybe city have the best manager in the world also, who make everything tik, personally i believe if gadiola managed our squad this season we would have won the league, everyone has been complaining about city's spending the truth is others like united and chelsea have spent equally as much. football every season is different with it's challenges that we finished point below city doesn't mean next season we win the league, doesn't even guarantee next season city will be the best team... liverpool pushed city for season's look at them this season, they can win it this season, i don't like predicting the future, we can prepare our best but others will equally prepare, these closed gap doesn't mean we are automatically disposed others as title contenders you can look at it in many direction. even if we have our best recruitment next season city will still probably have the better squad, this season what happened last season that ended our top hope repeated again, if city win the league eventually, how does that have to do with the quality of city? i believe we have a very good foundation and i'm optimistic about our future and this is my objective. let's finish the season before we are making any conclusions. how can you say we have a good foundation and be optimistic? according to the ""realists"" on ja we have bottled it, our captain is not good enough, our players are overrated, we have no plan b, we have failed this season, every other manager is more experienced and has better tactics. in fact, there really is no hope because this season is over, mc are better, mu are better and next year we have no chance again because everyone else is going to be better. it's been a terrible season and the future's bleak. @ gun down...life is not that complicated at all, people only make it hard to live in for themselves.. in real life if you don't like the way things are shaping out in your place of work and you've got no power to change things...the best thing is for you to look for another job... the same goes with supporting a club. if arsenal as a club or ateta are so useless to the extent that you're sad with our performance this year .. you're free to support man city the better club ... at least it's free to support any club ... it's normal to complain but it's annoying to keep repeating the same thing over and over when you can at least get your happiness from elsewhere.... where you able to achieve all your personal goals for this year even when you put in all your possible best ... that show's you that, what you thought to be ""your best"" might look like a ""your mistake"" to others ... life can definitely overrule any plan and hardwork ... at any time... i hope we get the two english players ornstein's touting. they're best of mates and look to be in need of ""a new challenge"", or whatever they call it these days. arteta is still learning on the job, and has almost completed his best season, and will get better, and the team along with him. we'll challenge again. this season has been quite a ride. nice saying jax :thumbs_up: yes. but the second place isn't guaranteed yet, because we still have to play against chelsea/ newcastle/ brighton and we will have two more games after that and one of those games after that is nottingham forest who beat liverpool the other day and drew with man city previously, walloped brighton last week. their lowly position doesn't seem to matter when they're at home. they will put in extra efforts if they still have a good chance to stay in epl liverpool beat forest - yes we have over achieved from what we have done the previous seasons where we have underachieved. like last season we have finished higher than the season before but also like last season, we have failed to take a opportunity. th last season was ours and we threw it away. st this season was ours and we threw it away. now i hear some people say, dont get gready!!!!! well i am not gready just a little worried about the soft under belly that still exists. there are reasons why we have capitulated this season and it was not due to injuries ( all though they dont help ) it was due to the way we cant sustain our form under pressure. our set up is flimsy and the way the manager and players handle it is not very inspiring. well done for second but lets not get all gushy. why are we saying overachieving, please let's be realistic a season that saw chelsea and liverpool spend most of their season mid table, a season that united are rd or th playing in two cup finals with a manager in his first season at united, a season that saw newcastle probably ending in top , outside city and wobbling liverpool with aging squad we and city are the most stable club currently, mind u even in the mist of all these we are probably ending trophyless, knocked out at both cups at earliest possible, just made it past the europa group stage and sent home... the truth is if city were to win the league then it's a big missed opportunity, i can't see many top clubs dropping this low next season take a look at the whole picture and tell me where arsenal would have finished and be see as progress, below united and newcastle who finished last season below us and who have managers that is less than two years and one year with their clubs respectively. arsenal title challenge this season is not over. chelsea is next. our dip at a crucial time was a combination of factors imho. . lack of proper rotation. no need to reshuffle starting , start or different players while starting one's in form. . injuries to key players at critical times. . not dropping players out of form . no plan b or change in approach or play when the team is clearly struggling. . players can't dig themselves out of a crisis, and our leaders aren't leading when the team falters. still a lot of work to be done next year. the mental aspect still an issue, and a plan b when things go sideways. can't approach every game with the same tactics, even pep and klopp change things up when needed. yes, we haven't closed the tremendous gap but it's definitely decreasing. we are lacking squad depth and haven't the best squad either, but we are moving in the right direction. well dp, there are plenty who will disagree that we haven't got squad depth. i don't think we have squad depth or sufficient quality from those who are fit. it is overlooked that tomi has a long term injury. well said @ durand. total agreement with you. squad depth is a myth!!!!! and a poor excuse. the last four games, the only first team regular missing was saliba. if we are that flimsy then we will never win anything. one player out does not allow squad depth to be a valid excuse. it is a poor excuse and not the reason. i avoided saying this because i knew people will attack me, people saying injuries makes me laugh maybe i will make an article about our struggles but maybe that too will be seen as a negative article it probably will be (seen as negative), but a fully fit top-quality squad is obviously key to success over the whole season. that's your opinion and not mine. do guardiola share your opinion :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: no didrik, its fact, saliba is the only first team player missing these last four games and we have had a healthy bench in all areas. unlike you reggie, i didn't think arsenal could go the whole season without a dip in form. saliba has been one of arsenal's best players this season and among the league's best centre-backs. his importance to the team is highlighted by how many goals arsenal conceded on average before and after he was injured. i don't think saliba's absence is the whole reason, but our defense has definitely become more vulnerable during his absence. yes it has nobody is denying that. the problem is, are we so finely tuned that one little piece goes missing andxwe collapse? or have we got no plan b, or are we so flimsy one piece missing, its good night irene. because that has what has happened. the squad is still in good shape, the team not so. we aren't good enough and we have never achieved points during a season. man.city has achieved points several times, and when you need points+ to win the league you can't make many mistakes. we have had a tremendous epl season and has almost closed the points gap between our clubs. i'm optimistic about our future and i believe we will get better next season. coyg dp, agree, but the problem for next season is that liverpool and chelsea can't be as poor as they were this season, newcastle united, manchester united and aston villa are on an upward trend, with good managers and have owners willing and able to spend, while clubs like tottenham hotspurs, brighton & hove albion, brentford and fulham will be more than nuisance value. next season should be very competitive for the champions league places and arsenal will have the added demands of competing in europe, plus hopefully greater attention to the domestic cups. i don't worry about next season i believe we will get better become a regular top club again. if we are second best this season we should aim for the title next season. just think about the journey we have had last three years... there could yet be a twist in this season, as city have two potential trip-ups for their final games. unpredictable brentford and wonderful bha may be our saviours yet. it's not over as long as we do not drop any more points, but i'm sure the players are quite aware of this. are you guys not tired of this? we are out of all competition and wobbling, we keep predicting city have this, they play that and are in fa cup final and semi finals of the ucl, we play a game every week and look so jaded still.. agree gd, we are out of form and city are bang in form. where do these people think this massive turn around is going to come. and same people saliba is still out so your theories make no sense. winning by stretching rules or using lawyers to find weaknesses in uefa's financial fair play regulations. football has become a dirty business and man.city should have been stopped long time ago. agree dp, but money talks with football; you only have to look at the track record of the english fa and fifa (look no further than the award of the world cup to qatar). as for manchester city, a serial offender under ffp, financial penalties are a joke and just gift money to the governing bodies, while loss of points, relegations etc are a pipe dream. yaa your right it's not over ,let win all the games and we see while we have improved from last season ,it will seem like a waste if we do not go on to win the league having been points clear ,also while we have improved other teams have been awful this season that won't be the case next season and i feel we may have missed our chance if we come second . half a billion spent on players we should be seeing improvement anyway ,so to say we have overachieved is an overstatement imo . pts clear with plenty of games to play against city was nothing! we all knew that they could win on the bounce playing in third gear. amazing job managing to get that lead in the first place. i'd be disappointed if another team caught us, but not city. even an amazing liverpool team over a / year period could only finish above city once. straight to the point, good reading, jen. but you skirt over the fact we should have took - points from games that we should have won (liverpool being the exception) .you have to remember that city have their eyes on the big one and have been playing midweek also ,while we went out of el against a really poor team so there was no excuse not to beat southampton and west ham imo ,while it's great we have put up a fight this season it also stinks of last season when we completely folded when top was so easy to get . if we finish second it will be on par with the bottle job from last season ,let's see how long the owners put up with that after so much expenditure,he will get next season no doubt but there won't be anywhere to hide from him or the excuses that arise so often reagarding his tenure here thus far . let's hope city take their eye off the ball and we somehow go on to take the title . do you believe that arsenal started the season and considered themselves title contenders? did you expect arsenal to play league games without dip in form? i never expected us to win the league because we haven't the best first eleven or squad. i felt sad in five minutes time, but realised that arsenal can never compete with a shady club stretching uefa's financial fair play regulations. football have become a dirty business and i hope arsenal never will be like man.city. coyg :thumbs_up: dan, draws, plus loss to everton were critical. it's beyond me anyway that the tone has changed. well pointed out that we have done so well to be where we are. the minute there is a downturn arteta is to blame. weak mentality. no rotation. bottlers and so on but excuses are made for every team who are below us for being out of sorts and who will be better than us next season. . this is a regular football season like all seasons when anything can happen... except that at the moment our arch rivals right now have almost been in a class of their own for / years well ofc arteta is to blame just as emery and wenger before him were too ,i don't get you're point sue . yes we have improved but there was absolutely no excuse to lose so many points in the last games ,i've been right behind arteta and the team all season but i will call out this manager and team when i believe they have let us down ,which they have . would be nice to get out of moderation pat ,maybe blame old jonny boy for my outburst last weekend ,out of sort by me but had a bad week personally . but i won't stand crap from him or anyone else . sorry dan. you are both in moderation till th may. i can't wake up to crap like that. i need a rest well i come back on the th may then it's funny how you keep complaining that there's no excuse for dropping so many points over the last games (arsenal's only genuine bad run so far by the way), yet there's no realisation and acknowledgement that arteta had done a phenomenal job getting us into that position prior to the liverpool game in the first place. for some bizarre reason, you're defining arteta's season on these games and ignoring the insanely good job he did in the first games. he's made mistakes for sure over the last few games, but it's not his fault what ramsdale doing what he did against southampton, or saka missing a crucial pen. stop being so negative all the time, and focus on the huge progression we've made. jen, we have progressed but we should have won it. i didn't believe we could, until the day we lost - at home to city. that might sound strange, but we only went down because two of our players gifted it to city on a plate. we were better than them initially in that game and that actually gave me confidence because i thought (maybe naively) that we would learn from those mistakes. unfortunately we didn't. we have no discipline at the back and sometimes in midfield. that title was there for the taking. the cup was screaming at us to take it home, but we ignored it. the loss of concentration for those games was hugely disappointing dk and virtually ensured the title would slip away from us as i couldn't envisage us beating city after that im just frustrated at the level of blame that has been bandied about after what has been a very good season so far. perhaps it's my ever advancing years that allows me to be more able to take the rough with the smooth and not blow a fuse if the wheel falls off - hopefully temporarily in this case. of course i want arsenal to be numero uno. i still think arteta and the team are evolving but are clearly not at the level of pg and his players and the depth of talent that sits on the bench. would maureen have blown it from our position, no. he would have parked the bus, played in defence or done what he could to have ground out a draw at city. we didn't even park our bike!!!!! would he have gotten us to the lead in the first place. not very likely! his record says yes!! whether you chose to accept it or not arteta is the major reason we might not win the league this season and i bet his favoritism is causing problems behind the scenes. nonsense, man.city is better than us and have been better than us for many years. in addition do they have a better first eleven and squad than us. how often has arsenal achieved points during a season? whatever you think about arteta, man.city won both their games against us and will finish their season with more points than us. it's sad that football is a game run by shady people. we lost the league in the three games previous to the city game. city to us this season should have been irrelevant. we had it and blew it. nothing to do with city. we lost the league because one team is better than us and won both games against us. in addition are they able to achieve + points year after year. we have almost closed the tremendous gap between our clubs, but to finish the league above man.city, and all their famous lawyers are almost impossible. didrik, it's not impossible. it was extremely possible at one point this season. when we went - up at anfield it looked very possible. it's our own fault. if we had the defensive solidity of newcastle we would have won the league..... and easily. even a club like newcastle for instance, haven't got a solid defence because of money, it's because their manager and his team coached their players to defend properly. we on the other hand were too helter-skelter at the back and sometimes in midfield. too many unessary topsy-turvey performances against vastly inferior teams shows that we were not solid enough defensively. both games against city didnt matter, it was the points against the likes of everton, southampton and west ham, that lost us the league, the city game would have been a free hit. the year leicester won the league, they lost to the second team twice that season, us. let's win it next season, but we need to create positive energy around the club :red_circle: :thumbs_up:reggie, so near but no cigar. :face_with_rolling_eyes: so no responsibility from arteta for getting us into that amazing position in the first place then? we must have had a different manager up until the liverpool game then! agree jen, one has to be evenhanded in assessing mickel arteta's management, as he has got a lot right. damn arsenal supporters are negative some damn arsenal supporters are too positive. one can only be positive about this season because we've massively overachieved. imagine a team like qpr getting to an fa cup final, but losing to a team like liverpool or utd in the final, then your own fans calling the players and manager out as bottlers. disgusting! cant say ive seen those words. no one can predict what will happen to underperforming big teams this season when it comes to next season because, last season when we missed top , i remember we are all tipping many big teams to be contenders ahead of us which will make it more harder for arsenal this season to qualify for champions league. but what happened at last ? who would have predicted such a bad season for liverpool, chelsea, even tottenham. we expect them to be contenders the way they finished last season. (especially the way chelsea splash out cash to buy players). but reverse is the case.... so in my opinion. arsenal have gone beyond many expectations this season. therefore, no one can predict what will happen next season as well. all we should hope for is a smart transfer window and far better season for our beloved club next season. coyg. totally agree with you, we should focus on ourselves and what we can influence. is it possible for this team to get better next season? absolutely. how many thought it was possible for arsenal to be title contenders two years ago :red_circle:",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-01T08:30:00Z

" ""bayer leverkusen's unbeaten run came to an unexpected end against their local rivals, who secured safety in delirious style it was always going to end at some point. they just didn't want it to be here. leverkusen's phenomenal unbeaten run was stopped at games, at the start of the week that will contain their europa league semi-final first-leg date with destiny against roma. ""it just wasn't a good performance,"" said the sporting director, simon rolfes, seeking to dedramatise the disappointment. ""it was down to us that we lost this game. no one else."" the midfielder robert andrich so often the barometer of mood in good times and bad, who always seems to find the right words, was a touch more frank. ""it doesn't get much more difficult to take than when a run like this ends in the derby against koln,"" he lamented. ""and in the bayarena."" the frustration was compounded by the manner in which the hosts had briefly clawed themselves level in the first half. it was so alonso-era leverkusen in manner that it was almost pastiche. andrich won the ball back deep in the right-back position and then it moved quickly, right to left; jeremie frimpong to amine adli to mitchel bakker, down the left channel to moussa diaby, who held it up for a second, before picking out the onrushing adli to fire confidently home from the edge of the area. koln's season had started with high hopes, with a europa conference league place to enjoy. there have been myriad bumps in the road since - the abrupt exit of anthony modeste to dortmund, a major outbreak of crowd trouble on their trip to nice, a heroic but exhausting eventual exit from europe in the return against the same opposition, and then flatlining league form - but they have got where they needed to be. this win, combined with losses for stuttgart and bochum, have mathematically confirmed koln's safety. that they could celebrate it here, against local rivals where large sections of their support have genuine cultural disdain for them, and that they could celebrate the departing club legends jonas hector and timo horn in front of their massed ,-strong travelling support, meant everything. ""if the bayarena hadn't closed at some point,"" wrote martin zenge in express, cologne's major newspaper, ""the koln fans would probably still be celebrating. whether it's the 'derbysieger' chant on a continuous loop, the chants for [hector and horn] or the team dancing in front of the packed guest block, die geissbocke had last experienced a party like this when they qualified for the conference league."" when the team bus arrived back at geissbockheim, the club's training centre, just before am, a hardy band of fans greeted them with chants and pyro. it was going to be a good weekend, as decreed by steffen baumgart. the coach, who fully joined in the celebrations in front of the away end, cancelled saturday's training session as a thank you to his players. ""after [collectively running] km, it was granted to the lads,"" cheered the club's twitter account. it was a particularly great night for selke, who had opened the scoring with a towering header and looked every inch the centre-forward that he has often promised to be, rather than the one that he often has been. he clashed with andrich, who accused selke of being overly ""theatrical"", which underlined how much he had got under leverkusen's skin. the ultimate compliment, really. this, then, will be the challenge for the impressive alonso, as if jose mourinho wasn't enough of one already. we know he can make his team cruise with style and grace, but can he quickly restart the car now it has stalled? kick off your evenings with the guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion borussia dortmund, then, went into the late sunday game against an in-form wolfsburg under genuine pressure with a four-point gap to narrow. they responded emphatically, with a - win that could easily have been bigger without koen casteels' saves. the outstanding karim adeyemi and jude bellingham both scored twice, although a crestfallen adeyemi spurned the chance of a hat-trick in lifting a penalty bellingham had won over the bar.

"diaby has been one of the finest wingers in europe in the last few seasons and continues to do well when he plays for bayer leverkusen. his performances have now caught the attention of real madrid, which means arsenal will struggle to add him to their squad. madrid is the dream club for most players, but a report on sports bild reveals diaby does not seem interested in joining them. instead, the winger will likely move to a premier league side as he has established contact with some clubs already. just arsenal opinion diaby is an exciting winger to watch and the attacker could make us much stronger if we add him to our group. if we fail to land him and another premier league side does, we will only have ourselves to blame. video - mikel arteta discusses the newcastle threat and gives an update on arsenal injury problems calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link...",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-06T14:30:00Z
"this week, we've been made to believe arteta has a perfect plan to add much-needed quality to his squad in the summer. arsenal want to clinch the premier league title this season, but there is a chance they won't win it. manchester city looks like they are on course for another league title. is a PS million transfer budget enough to complete these six deals? darren n video - mikel arteta talks about the reasons arsenal are second - ""we were so close"" calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... caicedo would likely cost more than PS m, diaby might be too expensive as well, zaha is too old to be our winger and guehi's abilities seem too similar to white's i'd be surprised if they just rely on jesus, balogun and trossard for the cf position there is a few options, ndicka is a quality defender from german league, free and would defo upgrade on rob holding who could be sold for a few million along with taveres. get elneny & vieria gone also and replace with teilimans on a free then leaves room and money to buy a quality defensive midfielder to help thomas partey out & cover him. seems declan rice may be that guy or caicedo by the looks of it. that leaves the attacking options to work on. reiss nelson is leaving on a free, flo is back and eddie is hit or miss so its a hard choice what to do there tbh. ode & smithrowe keep battling away against each other is the best way to work that as emile was brilliant in that role and reason he got the no, injuries are killing this young lad. we need a striker who is a natural born goal scorer like a haaland type, big strong fast & knows where the net is. alot of work to be done in the summer, interested now to see are we heading in as champions or runners up. a war chest of PS mill was a recent estimate for four players off the gaffer wish list. not sure what we could salvage from our own fire sale. balogun tavares lonkango marie nelson caicedo rice diaby tapsoba vlohovic zubimendi players on that list alone would cost us million (rice, vlohovic ) diaby imo is worth no more than million not a patch on pepe who's not deemed good enough ,only player on your list i would be interested in would be zubimendi . as for your list as sales we would get million at most ,nelson is out of contract. my word :hushed_face: think they will need minimum million but to really challenge recon million on - top quality players if they do that then believe they can challenge again for the prem league next season although don't think they would have ever got a better chance than winning it this season as everyone else will strengthen there squads and will definitely be more competitive next season so gona get even harder to win the league! lets not forget that man city are fixing their finances to be we're they are. and the fa are allowing this by doing as little as they can. cheating on or off the pitch is always unacceptable.. there's got to be some decent money available as arsenal spent a lot less in the last window due to the mudryk thing falling though. also with the league position certainly being much higher this season than in previous years, and champion's league/etc, that's got to leave things looking very good in terms of funds for bringing in players. too little for a team aspiringuy ivan toney and forget about a winger. we have enough to be champions. i don't believe in spending huge fund on over hyped players. arsenal scouting team should comb the lower leagues in south america, asia and around the world to unearth young talents like martinelli and guendozi etc. we don't need to spend too much to be competitive. chelsea spent fortune in the summer but they are still struggling.. big players don't guarantee success these days, it the tactical approach of the coach that really counts. newcastle is doing well without spending too much. nope!",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-06T07:30:10Z
"it felt, at the time, like a promise. and arteta has certainly stayed true to his word in the subsequent three years, as he and sporting director edu have reshaped the arsenal squad by bluntly removing the players they did not want. there has been no time for sentiment in north london, where star players have been exiled and big contracts have been terminated. among those who look the most vulnerable this summer are many of the academy graduates who have progressed into the senior team over the past few years. these players have been fundamental to the rebuild of arsenal in recent seasons but the train is moving quickly and it is increasingly clear that not all of them will be able to stay on board. such thoughts might not sit comfortably with arsenal's supporters. this, though, is the reality of the club's current situation. ""arsenal dna"" is important, of course, but so is champions league-level quality. now is the time for performance, not potential. reiss nelson is also out of contract at the end of this season. talks are ongoing over his future but it would be no surprise if he also departed, especially with arsenal targeting a high-class winger (it is understood they are among the clubs to have registered an interest in bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby). folarin balogun, who has starred on loan in france this season, is also regarded as likely to be sold. the -year-old has scored goals in ligue and is clearly ready for regular first-team action but it seems unlikely that he will take the same path as william saliba whose spell on loan in france was the foundation for him to become among arsenal's most important players. with gabriel jesus and eddie nketiah ahead of balogun at arsenal, he is unlikely to find it under arteta. charlie patino, the highly rated midfielder who scored on his first-team debut last season, is planning to leave on a permanent basis. with arsenal set to strengthen in central midfield this summer, the -year-old's pathway to regular first-action appears to be blocked. and then there is emile smith rowe, who has played such an important role in arsenal's development over the past few years. without smith rowe, who changed the course of arteta's tenure with his performances in the winter of /', arsenal and their manager would not be where they are today. but he has barely featured in the second half of this season, despite being fit, and his future looks increasingly uncertain. this weekend, arsenal come up against joe willock, who joined the club as a child and was sold to newcastle united for more than PS million in . the midfielder's success since his move has made it a good deal for all concerned (stylistically he was not the right fit under arteta) and arsenal can only hope for similar outcomes with the other academy players who do not become first-team regulars. arteta wants to retain a young british core, with bukayo saka and aaron ramsdale both close to agreeing new contracts. but the demands are rising on arsenal's players and, as the squad evolves, not all of their academy starlets will be deemed ready for what comes next.'}",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-06T01:30:00Z

like vieira? like kiwior? take your pick. zubimendi, savic, gravenberch, lavia, bruno, bellingham, mount, caicedo, tchouameni, thuram, that cm in lille, palhina, bennacer... idk, thats a few. arsenal should go after one or two,but i think declans fitness and availability is noted, he plays every game. i'm sure arsenal would be willing to pay up to PS m for rice, but hopefully they will make an investment for romeo lavia or sander berge instead i agree on lavia point lavia looks very skilful option in midfield area he is pretty good at keeping ball.. and he will be available for cheap as southampton anyway going to be relegated... but we strongly need cf like dusan vlahovic or youssef en-nesyri or victor osimhen you can't always win with cf like jesus sometimes you have to bypass midfield to play long ball football and then these type cfs give you extra option also sometimes you have to rely on crossing to score goals and you can't rely on jesus for that.. you need cfs like these yeah, i was really impressed by lavia's capabilities in one-on-one situations when he played against us. his playing style reminds me of partey's he will fill our england homegrown requirements and he was trained with man city's system, so he would likely not need much time to get familiar with ours i also agree that a new cf should be the highest priority. none of our cfs, including balogun, can play like the target men you mentioned :thumbs_up: kedar, hopefully lavia is a priority. agree totally on rationale for cf. we need players in the mold of martineli but midfielders, tall, fast and skilful with winning mentality, surely it must have swollen some what since with the busy summer market transfer window coming up. that wish list been touted is very ambitious and any four acquire from it will be a statement of intent. the history is obvious. edu and arteta always play a hidden cat game with selling clubs. everytime they fail to get the players the media hyped about, they go and get someone better and cheaper. such games will get more savage with boehly around. prepare yourselves folks. totally agree. they were just lucky with trossard. their record in the transfer market is bland at best. they are always buying for the future, but the future is now!!! can fan, we were lucky indeed with trossard. all i can say about that is de zerbi must be an immense coach/manager with a no-nonsense attitude and very sure of himself if he can just discard trossard like that. he must have really disliked the lad. he put it down to trossard having ""a bad attitude"". after brighton's loss to forest, he dropped mitoma and macallister, then gave wolves a good spanking without them !. very impressive. anyway thankfully trossard is ours. transfers are hit or miss, and i don't think edu and arteta are any different. martinelli, odegaard, white, etc... are hits as are others. willan, mari, luiz extension, cedric, are misses are among their misses. it helps when ownership spends around million and likely to be half a billion or more this summer. let's win something first with these players before crowing about success. the only trophy with our current leadership was through the dross and deadwood acquired by previous managers. we are primed for next year, and i believe we will win silverware of some sort. durand, you forgot about pepe (unless you rate him that is). i always thought there was a player in him somewhere, but he seemd to be a bit of a loose cannon who could only play his own way and not the way arteta wanted him to. brighton are top of the league when it comes to value for money on acquisitions.chelsea must be bottom and we would be mid table? raul brought in pepe when emery was managing i believe, and edu was fresh in his post, so i don't count arteta in that transfer. pepe had a mountain to overcome based off his fee, but at least he did better than willan and nketiah in my opinion. sorry i forgot he was already here, thanks for putting me straight. i'll never understand what happened with willian. i was quite excited when he came because i'd always rated him as the best brazilian to play in england, because he was a resounding success even playing in the shadow of hazard. he was mr. consistency at the bridge but total rubbish with us except for his first match. ot: according to reports,reiss nelson has just turned down a contract extension from arsenal.another player looking for more playing time, i'm guessing. am told brighton had made contact with his representatives but in the meantime, i am of the thinking that arsenal have yet to switched on to next summer transfer window mode. this is because the window is yet to open. and besides, arsenal are currently in this season's epl title win run in battling to win the title. in the forward positions. gabriel jesus, nkethia, balogun, saka, martinellitrossard and nelson if he stops pulling haywire on his contract extension should all be in arsenal first team squad list for next season's summer campaign. but a lot could depend on arsenal's next preseason before arteta takes the final decision on their staying status at the club to play next summer. ""but the fact is that arteta and edu have proved themselves to be extremely reliable on the transfer front"" this is not a fact. taking an opinion that you believe to be true, then calling it a fact, doesn't make it a fact. fact! in the transfer market, arsenal need a midfield power house in the mould of yaya toure. rodri of mancity, fabinho. in that caliber to sustain a league fight. a rb in the mould of walker in city, these are the kind of players that will take us to the next level. my two cents.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-04T17:30:00Z

"messi's th league goal in europe breaks ronaldo's record and secures th ligue title amid sour mood at the club. psg moved ahead of the previous record of titles set by saint-etienne in and which they equalled a year ago under former coach mauricio pochettino. it is psg's ninth title in the last seasons, a period in which they have dominated french football under the ownership of qatar sports investment. psg started the penultimate weekend of the season six points clear of nearest rivals lens with just six points to play for, and with a far better goal difference. in the end, they needed only the draw to be officially confirmed as champions with a game to spare, as lens eased to a - win over already-relegated ajaccio. kylian mbappe set up messi to put psg ahead just before the hour mark with his th ligue goal this season. it was also messi's th league goal in europe and broke cristiano ronaldo's scoring record for europe's top five leagues. ex-paris striker gameiro equalised with minutes left, bundling in the rebound after gianluigi donnarumma had saved from morgan sanson. the draw ultimately suited both teams as it enabled strasbourg to guarantee their top-flight survival. psg's triumph was secured despite christophe galtier's team losing six games in , while nearest challengers lens have taken most of the plaudits. however, they lost six of their first league games in and were eliminated from the champions league in the last by bayern munich and in the french cup at the same stage. psg's holy grail is the champions league, in which the club has regularly come up short at the crucial moment - including crashing out in the last five times in seven seasons. the mood around the club in recent weeks has appeared sullen with fans disaffected. neymar, now , has suffered more injury problems and messi was suspended for missing training after taking an unauthorised trip to saudi arabia. when results were going poorly, some of the fans' anger was targeted towards messi, who was seen to be underperforming after his return from winning the world cup with argentina. marco kirdemir, a football agent, told al jazeera earlier this month that it is clear messi - who is out of contract at the end of the season - wants a change of scenery. ""he could go with al hilal, or inter miami or barcelona ... but what is certain is that messi will not be with psg next year because there is already a rupture, including one with the fans,"" he said. there is also increased speculation that galtier - who also won the title with lille two years ago - will be replaced in the close season. ""when we take stock, we need to analyse the first half of the season and what state the players were in when they came back from the world cup,"" galtier said on friday. ""but i understand the disappointment. it has been a very strange season."" mbappe - scorer of goals this season - might wonder now if he made the right choice, although the question of his future is bound to come up again soon. according to reports, the -year-old's contract will run out next year unless he exercises an option to stay until . all eyes will be on what luis campos, psg's portuguese recruitment guru, does in the transfer market. he is restrained by uefa's financial fair play rules and by the fact that psg has an array of unwanted players on big contracts who are set to return after a season on loan. the saving on messi's annual salary of an estimated million euros ($.m) net would provide some leeway. much has been made of the willingness to focus on younger players hailing from the paris region, a prolific breeding ground for talent. meanwhile, the club's owners continue to be thwarted in their attempts to buy the parc des princes from the city of paris so they can expand capacity, raising the possibility of a move to the larger stade de france. follow al jazeera english:'}",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-28T10:08:04Z
"the young monaco midfielder has taken an unconventional path in his career and could be on the move again this summer by luke entwistle for get french football news youssouf fofana is not the only player to have graduated from the concrete pitches of the ile-de-france to the france team, but few have followed such an unconventional path. the monaco midfielder is the embodiment of the idea that maturity is not measured in years but in experience. when he joined strasbourg at , he had already endured more setbacks than many players suffer in their entire careers. ""we are one of the countries that has the most access to pitches and it's the first sport we can play together freely,"" says fofana as he attempts to explain why france develops so many young players. riyad mahrez, who grew up in the same region, articulated a similar argument a few years ago. ""we always play outside,"" said mahrez. ""when i go out in england, i never see people playing outside. other countries don't make players the same as france. in france, you can be outside because there are small football pitches everywhere."" however, three years after leaving clairefontaine his abilities earned him a second chance at strasbourg. ""strasbourg prepared me more mentally because their training centre, compared to clairefontaine and monaco, in terms of quality, is a level below. it pushed me to go higher and further, and i improved more mentally than technically or tactically,"" says fofana. france made it past england and, with fofana back in the heart of midfield, they beat morocco - to reach the final. the game against argentina started badly for the reigning champions, who were - down before they started playing. ""maybe we lacked a bit of experience,"" says fofana, who was introduced into the game during extra time. ""in the whole minutes, we only messed up the first , which cost us dearly. if we played the first like we did the rest of the match, we could have won."" despite defeat in doha, france have flourished in recent years. they have reached three of the last four major finals as well as being copied by other international sides, notably england. however, it is a different story at club level. french sides have underwhelmed in european competition this season, with no ligue side reaching the semi-finals of any of the three competitions. nice went the furthest, reaching the quarter-finals of the europa conference league before being knocked out by basel. bernardo silva, a former monaco player, said recently that ligue is ""more difficult, more physical"" than the premier league, yet he is preparing to play in a champions league final while ligue 's fifth place in the uefa coefficient came under considerable threat from the eredivisie this season. ""the french league has a dna as a physical, intense league."" says fofana. ""on the other hand, there are the european competitions where perhaps we need to manage games more to win. france lacks experience given that not many clubs have access to it every year."" despite recognising the challenges facing ligue teams, fofana is positive about the future. ""we lack experience at this level and, with experience, i think we can do big things in europe. little by little, we're getting our bearings and why not next season or in two or seasons, we'll do what italy did this season,"" he says. the story of the pizza boy turned world cup finalist is a testament to his own determination and france's elite training system; very few prospects fall through the cracks and many go on to fill premier league squads. having stepped from springboard to springboard, fofana may be the next ligue product to take the plunge in england. this is an article from get french football news follow luke entwistle and gffn on twitter'}",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-26T10:23:06Z

" ""julien laurens talks about what psg need to do in order to become a more powerful force in european football. (:) the champions league escaped the club again, ill discipline burdened the squad again and despite being on the verge of another ligue title, psg have to change. not only do they need to evolve, but they need to be aiming in the right direction ... for once. so how can the owners fix the mess? let's start with the most important thing. what the fans want more than anything else is to see a proper psg team next season. not just individuals on the pitch trying to find each other or improvise: instead, a proper team with patterns of play, a style of football, new ideas and unpredictable movement, with passing triangles, intelligence and structure. none of that has pretty much existed in the last few years, or certainly not consistently enough. under christophe galtier or mauricio pochettino, psg's two most recent managers, players would complain about them not putting in enough work on team tactics. having great stars like lionel messi, neymar or kylian mbappe is only one element of a successful team; it doesn't mean that your team should then just give them the ball and let them figure it out by themselves. when psg play with a three-man defense, it's often a struggle for them to find the wing backs in space and as a result, they rarely switch play to throw opposing defenses off. the nine (!) defeats suffered in games in all competitions in -- one loss every three matches -- were down to the team lacking tactics (lyon, monaco, lyon), being unable to press properly (bayern munich, rennes) or beat the opposition press (marseille, lens, rennes, bayern munich again). that has to change: psg should be able to press and also have the answer against an aggressive team, while possessing a clear idea on how to move the ball properly. to become a proper team, this squad will need the right manager, and the two are strongly linked. after years of the wrong coaching appointments, psg have to pick well this time. this time, whoever comes in to occupy the bench has to be the right fit -- someone with a real identity and philosophy, but also the right degree of adaptability to an evolving team. they also need a strong personality to cope with the spotlight in paris: the pressure to perform, the expectations of the fans and the club's qatari owners, not to mention the politics within the club. this manager might not exist on the market this summer, but the chosen candidate will have to be as close as possible from the profile above. so whether nasser al khelaifi and the big deciders like thiago motta, luis enrique, jose mourinho, antonio conte, luciano spalletti, zinedine zidane or julian nagelsmann doesn't matter so much. among these guys, the best one has to be chosen. - stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga, more (u.s.) finally, the players have to fit what the new manager will want. luis campos, psg's sporting director, and the club's owner must first appoint the man in charge and then deliver the players he'll need. but overall, we know what the club wants to do this summer. sources told espn that most of the transfer targets this summer will be younger players, mostly french and, ideally if possible, from paris. the likes of midfielders manu kone (borussia monchengladbach) and kephren thuram (nice), forwards randall kolo muani (eintracht frankfurt), moussa diaby (bayer leverkusen), playmaker rayan cherki (lyon) or defender evan n'dicka (frankfurt) are all on the list. there are exceptions, of course, like bernardo silva (manchester city), who is keen to join, and victor osimhen (napoli) or harry kane (tottenham), who will be more of a challenge considering the amount of interest in both. - zaire-emery, bitshiabu are at the core of psg's next generation",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-24T18:05:45Z
"- stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga, more (u.s.) napoli brought in more money from transfer fees than they spent last summer and, in effect, used the proceeds from the exit of veteran defender kalidou koulibaly to chelsea (EUR million) to add what are now regarded as two of the best players in europe -- winger khvicha kvaratskhelia (EUR.m) and defender kim min-jae (EUR.m). that helped transform them into a squad capable of running away with the serie a title, which they did. chelsea, meanwhile, became addicted to writing checks instead of actually building a team, spent more than EURm on talent acquisitions, and might end up with their worst premier league finish in years. the - season is almost in the books, and the engine of the next transfer season is revving up loudly in the background. now is a good time to reflect. who actually benefited from spending big? who nailed a thriftier approach? to look at this past year\'s winners and losers, let\'s break teams into four quadrants: two good and two bad. among the teams in europe\'s big five leagues, who spent big (in terms of transfer fee balance) and who didn\'t? who actually got better and who didn\'t? obviously, the transfer fee is only one of two numbers that matter -- the other being the salaries that teams are paying -- and not every move is made to pay off immediately. plenty of clubs build for the future. but with the urgency and non-stop nature of the transfer industrial complex, looking at immediate returns is relevant, especially considering how one great or terrible window can define your fortune for years to come.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

" manchester united are keeping tabs on bayer leverkusen star moussa diaby in an effort to lure the frenchman to old trafford this summer, according to reports. bayer reportedly want upwards of PSmillion for the french international, whose contract expires in . newcastle are also interested in diaby following their successful campaign in the premier league, having secured champions league qualification for next season under eddie howe. with leverkusen set for the europa conference league at best next term, diaby could be keen to pursue a new chapter with a champions league outfit. manchester united are reportedly monitoring moussa diaby's situation at bayer leverkusen sheik jassim (left) and sir jim ratcliffe (right) are in a bidding war to take over the red devils manchester united's pursuit of the winger will depend on the club's ownership, according to sky sports, with the glazer family in the process of selling to either sheikh jassim bin hamad al thani or british billionaire sir jim ratcliffe. ratcliffe, whose company ineos took over nice since , was believed to be in the driving seat to land manchester united, but takeover uncertainty has continued to linger on at old trafford in recent weeks. meanwhile, it is understood newcastle's attempts to lure diaby to st james' park have not advanced in recent months. manchester united have also been linked with napoli centre-half kim min-jae ahead of the summer window and are continuing to plot a move for tottenham ace harry kane, who took his tally to premier league goals against brentford last weekend. manchester united have also been linked with a summer move for napoli defender kim min-jae bayer leverkusen believe manchester united and newcastle target diaby is worth up to PSm juventus hitman dusan vlahovic and serie a top scorer victor osimhen are also being targeted in deals worth PSm and PSm respectively. united are also interested in brighton teenager evan ferguson, who is being lined up as a potential star for the future. the red devils will hope to rival champions manchester city to the premier league crown next season and feel diaby, alongside a handful of additions elsewhere, could be enough to secure more silverware. share what you think",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-23T14:51:22Z
"play now men\'s brackets play now women\'s brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop it has been the most familiar mood music over which an arsenal season has been conducted: a star attacker wanted by the biggest clubs in the world, one whose contract is ticking towards a pivotal moment. in theory, it should have been tinkling away throughout this campaign. you\'d have done well to hear anything over the din the emirates stadium has made in its most boisterous moments but even without that jubilance, the sense of danger over an impending departure was nothing more than an echo of a whisper. saka believes he has found just the right spot to develop into the best version of himself. it was not so long ago that a particularly worrisome question hovered over arsenal: would they be able to provide saka with the canvas for his masterpiece? it would be one thing that the likes of robin van persie, samir nasri and alex oxlade-chamberlain concluded they needed to go elsewhere to fulfill their potential, quite another for arguably the greatest academy graduate since tony adams (all due respect to david rocastle, ashley cole and jack wilshere) to make the switch to manchester city or liverpool. that possibility seems further away now than it has in decades. if a talented young player wants to fulfill his potential there are precious few better-placed clubs to do so than arsenal. hence why declan rice has been so taken by interest from the gunners at a time when manchester united and chelsea have been gazing covetously in his direction. arsenal have similarly emerged as a serious option for mason mount, the sort of predatory move from a nominal rival that was once done unto this club. ""time is on our side,"" said saka. ""you can look at our team and a lot of the players are young. we\'re hungry, and a lot of us haven\'t won trophies at arsenal so we want to achieve big things. if you watch the way we all speak, we want to win and we want to win here. ""it\'s been too long since this club has had champions league football. i\'m really looking forward to tuesday and wednesday nights in this stadium, the atmosphere is going to be special."" as for saka, arsenal need only to cherish and protect him. with one game of the premier league season left, he has played , minutes, among the top midfielders and forwards. among manchester city\'s forwards, only erling haaland has logged more than ,. indeed saka has featured in every top-flight match for the gunners since may . no wonder he has looked a little burned out in recent weeks. in such circumstances, the monitoring of moussa diaby and raphinha makes sense; with a champions league campaign around the corner, he will need to have time off. happily, for arsenal, there are plenty more days ahead with saka in the team. there was no great contract crisis, just a team and talent in perfect harmony. now they can bask in the light of their star boy for years to come.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-23T13:01:30Z
" ""ilkay gundogan lifts the premier league trophy german midfielder ilkay gundogan will make a decision on his future after the champions league final, with the manchester city captain considering reported interest from arsenal. city are expected to offer gundogan a new contract, but the -year-old has put talks over his future on hold until after pep guardiola's side have completed their bid for a historic treble. catalan giants barcelona have also expressed interest in gundogan, who would add goals and experience to the arsenal midfield, especially as granit xhaka is expected to leave north london. however, arsenal's interest in gundogan will not affect their pursuit of their top summer target declan rice. arteta raided his old club city for gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko last summer and has a good relationship with gundogan from his time at the etihad. after that game in istanbul, city will make their final attempts to tie their captain down to a new contract. gundogan is seeking a two-year contract, but so far, city have only offer him a one-year extension despite his key role in their title success. today's sports news in seconds - rd may as well as gundogan and rice, the gunners also have interest in chelsea midfielder mason mount.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-23T10:41:23Z
"with the title race over, arteta and his boys set to finish second, can we look forward to what the summer awaits for the gunners? a few weeks ago, a report showed that arteta had a -man summer wish list. in that list, bayer leverkusen winger mousa diaby was featured. there was a suggestion that arteta sees diaby as the perfect alternative to bukayo saka. over the last few seasons, saka has been relied on for the right wing; with no one available to challenge him for that spot the -year-old has delivered, but at times fatigue has held him back. with champions league football back in the emirates, arteta needs saka to be fresh, and for that to be so, he needs to rest occasionally. there needs to be a reliable deputy for saka, and diaby could be that. so what are the chances diaby moves to the emirates? -- afcstuff (@afcstuff) may , daniel o calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... arsenal and anyone concerned should not be talking of back ups. thats part of the problem and why we are becoming ""backups"" spot on. one of our biggest problems this season was that the manager didn't seem to trust that we could win without saka and certain other players. that's one of city's strengths - you can't be certain if grealish will start, or mahrez, or alvarez or even de bruyne, so it's harder to set up against them. it also means they can sub first team players into the game if they need to change it. we need a pool of first team players, not a starting and backups. bowen ,quality player and could be as good as saka if playing in a better team . as for diaby ,no thanks he would be another pepe who imo is better . i think samuel chukwueze is a perfect back up for bukayo i honestly agree we should stop thinking about back ups as we've always treated them as such, believing or arteta always thinking ""they aren't ready"". arsenal should buy a player that can challenge saka for that position and as such bring competition and rotation to bear. if we want to challenge man city, we should buy like man city. quality players of equal strength and value. if we buy to improve our squad, we must learn to use the players, not only as spare tyres. we buy backups and then people complain, the backups are not good enough when the starter is out. what do people expect. if we do buy backups, which i would hope we dont, then we will always struggle. the engine room of a team is the central midfield and the fullbacks. arsenal need energetic athlete players in those positions which was lacking towards the end of this season. so caicedo and rice are perfect options and one quality energetic flexible full back that can play across the back four. i would use tossard as a permanent no first option started and have jesus and saka rotate on the right. tossard should only play as number not as a singer because he lacks the pace but he is creative and intelligent and has close ball control to be an excellent false number . i would promote tierney to rotate with martinelli on the left because they can both carry the ball with energy with martinelli more of a drbbler and tierney more of a crosser of the ball which we lack sometimes. sak a fan also cross the ball better from the left side so he needs to switch wings during the game sometimes to both provide crossed and shake off the double marking which he can't seem to beat. get a top striker who can deliver goals. jesus can compete with saka for rw. all the years with man city and this year with us have shown jesus is not a striker to lead the attack. he has proved himself and arteta wrong. he isnt a striker, pep knew that and is rubbing his hands with glee. durand true said bro, with our pacey wingers we need a center forward, which jesus is not. we need balogun back next season, and make additions to the midfield, defense and forwards. the we are good to go and compete for both the league and champions league. we are still hurting not winning the league. use one stone and kill two birds by bringing in an attack bully as in vlohovic leaving jesus and saka to compete on the right never mind back ups .the need for a stronger c.f has been evident since jesus returned from injury as he has been distinctly average at best imo.many well known central strikers have been mentioned in despatches and most would cost upwards of m.bearing in mind the need for quality recruits in central midfield, our budget is unlikely to extend to a high cost cf.however there is a young central striker currently playing for coventry city who may well be available for nearer m.i refer to victor gyokeres, the young swedish international.i have seen him on occasions this season and he has impressed me and many professional pundits.at ''' "" he is physically powerful and adept at holding up the ball. while he is not a flier, he makes great runs between the lines and is a good finisher.he is a handful in the championship and while he may find it more difficult in the premier league we should not lose sight of the fact that the likes of toney and watkins served their apprenticeship in the lower division and have gone on to do very well at a higher level. grandad, i watched that swedish striker the other night and totally agree with you. he looks a right handful. i always like hearing your recommendations - i hadn't heard of this player, but he looks interesting. one player i'm interested to know about is chuba akpom - he's had a fantastic season from the looks of it. have you had a chance to catch any of his games? i'm wondering if he's finally blooming and if you think he would be useful back at arsenal? i gues leo of ac milan could couilddo a lot in my own opinion although i like the look of kulusevki, i would go for bowen, as i would say with bowen there's more end product. yes davi i've seen akpom a few times for middlesborough and while he has done well, i think gyokeres is better.i also agree with hd and others on ja who appreciate bowen .he must be one of the hardest workers in the epl with great attitude and skill and he can finish.a cut above trossard imo. thanks for the reply - i have no idea, but it would be nice to bring back one of our former youth players. has to be at the level though!",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-21T11:00:00Z
"the phrase ""nobody's perfect"" just might not apply to jose mourinho when it comes to european soccer finals. the -year-old mourinho has won all five of the european finals in which the teams he has coached have appeared, and he now has an opportunity to add to his % record after roma reached the europa league final on thursday, drawing - against bayer leverkusen to secure a - victory on aggregate in their semifinal. even after all those trophies, emotion still poured out of mourinho as he was left in tears at the final whistle, after his team had somehow frustrated an utterly dominant leverkusen. it marks a second european final in as many years for roma under mourinho, after a -year absence for the italian club, but the portuguese coach was quick to downplay his own achievements. ""my concern isn't marking my place in the roma history books,"" mourinho told sky sports after the match. ""it's helping these kids (players) to grow and achieve important things. it's also helping the roma fans who have given me so much since day one. it's an immense joy to get to another final."" entering the tie with a - lead after edoardo bove's goal in the first leg, roma's defense held firm throughout the match despite the german team having % possession, and engineering shots compared to the giallorossi's one. forward moussa diaby perhaps came closest to that elusive goal for leverkusen but his effort hit the crossbar. roma will now face sevilla in the europa league final at budapest's puskas arena on may . the spanish team is likely to be a formidable foe - not least because sevilla has won all six of its previous europa league finals. as well as providing a chance for mourinho to add to his already sizeable trophy haul, victory in budapest would secure a spot in next season's champions league which otherwise seems unlikely given that roma is currently sixth in serie a. ""if they called, they didn't find me,"" he quipped in a sky sport italia interview ahead of the semifinal first leg, when asked about the psg reports. ""he sees roma as a way to bounce back to another big job,"" horncastle said on the football daily podcast. ""jose is someone who ultimately wants to win wherever he goes and i think he feels that at roma, unless they start changing the strategy and start spending more money, they're not going to be able to deliver a league title. ""he would like a project that is befitting his legacy again, which would be the chance to compete for a champions league."" cnn's ben church contributed to this report.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-19T10:42:41Z
"the uefa europa league final in budapest won't simply provide the opportunity to lift international silverware for italian side roma, who last night knocked out germany's bayer leverkusen in a hard-fought semifinal return leg. last night, both uefa europa league semifinals were packed with drama. at ramon sanchez pizjuan stadium, sevilla and juventus offered a very entertaining first half, featuring clear goal-scoring opportunities on both ends. the bianconeri probably had the biggest chance with fifa world cup champion angel di maria, who surprisingly missed the target from close range with an outside foot effort. substitute dusan vlahovic finally broke the deadlock in the th minute, just a few seconds after he stepped on the pitch. the serbia international showcased all his composure in front of goal when he beat sevilla's goalkeeper with a gentle, left-footed chip that gave his side the - lead. supported by , loud fans, sevilla immediately found the strength to come back from the disadvantage. the spanish side took six minutes to equalize the score, courtesy of former ac milan attacking midfielder suso, who fired from distance into the top-left corner. roma, who started on a - aggregate following a goal in the first leg by italian youngster edoardo bove, traveled to germany knowing that a tie against bayer leverkusen would suffice. the giallorossi lined up in a very organized -- system, channeling their energy on containing the opponent's attacks rather than bringing numbers forward. their efforts eventually paid off: after nine, seemingly eternal minutes of added time, the roma players could finally scream in joy for having clinched their second european final in two years and their first uefa europa league final since . reserving a spot in the uefa champions league has proven particularly challenging this year for serie a clubs, as six of them are fiercely fighting for three available slots with only three league rounds to spare. on may , roma are scheduled to take the field against sevilla at budapest's puskas arena, but there is already great anticipation in rome among the giallorossi fans. jose mourinho's men are ready to battle it out in a game that will define their current season as well as shape the fate of the upcoming one.

"by kyle fansler may , sevilla and roma punched their tickets to the europa league final in two weeks' time with dramatic results. roma withstood a bayer leverkusen onslaught in germany. meanwhile, sevilla required extra time to get past juventus in a classic. much like the first leg of this semifinal tie, the first half in germany was fairly devoid of clear chances. it took one moment for roma's edoardo bove to find the breakthrough in italy. that made it so roma simply had to defend a lead to advance to the final. from the start, it was always leverkusen to test the roma net. the best chance, though, was ever so slightly off target. moussa diaby let a shot go from, but it met the corner where the post meets the crossbar. rui patricio was left watching and thankfully saw it avoid the back of the net. that was the trend for the entire game. roma sat back and welcomed the german attack. even though roma attempted one shot, it was not the side that had to score. leverkusen, despite ripping away shots at rui patricio, only managed to get six of those on target. the portuguese was equal to each of them. leverkusen held the ball for over three-quarters of the game. despite leverkusen's dominance and an astonishing eight minutes of stoppage time, it is roma through to another european final. last season's europa conference league winners are through to budapest for a clash against another european power on may . that opponent came down to a thrilling contest in spain between sevilla and juventus. federico gatti, the man who secured a late equalizer for juventus in turin, almost had the breakthrough at the ramon sanchez pizjuan. the italian found himself alone on a corner and he pumped a header on net. however, a reactionary save from yassine bounou did enough to keep the game, and the tie, level. having played minutes, sevilla had its best opportunity with lucas ocampos. a low-driven cross from sevilla's right flank met a diving header from ocampos. the argentine guided the ball toward goal. however, a fantastic save from wojciech szczesny did enough. goal line technology showed half the ball was in, but not the entirety of it. not long after, angel di maria was wasteful following terrific work through the juventus midfield, especially adrien rabiot. the left-footed star opted to scoop the ball up with his left foot instead of going with his right or laying off to moise kean. the ball did not even test bounou in goal. three minutes after, szczesny saved a goal at his end, after marcos acuna fired a stinging shot from yards that was moving away from the polish goalkeeper. first-half chances continued to flip as moise kean hit the post just a minute before ivan rakitic lashed a volley over the juventus net. regardless, it was juventus to have the ball in the back of the net first. rabiot's strike did not count, as the visitors were offside in the build-up play. based on the first half, a goal was coming. however, both teams required substitutes to deliver a goal. for juventus, that was dusan vlahovic, who was on the pitch for a total of seconds before he scored. the serbian took advantage of poor sevilla defense. while bounou charged at vlahovic, he dinked it up and over the moroccan. yet, that lead in both the game and the tie lasted all of six minutes. for sevilla, it was suso, who came on in the nd minute. he delivered a powerful shot with his left foot from just outside the area to beat an outstretched szczesny. szczesny did well to keep the game level after that. in the minutes, sevilla fired off shots, and nine of those reached the italian net. another sensational stop in the th minute on youssef en nesyri kept juventus alive to force extra time. erik lamela delivered an inch-perfect header to beat szczesny four minutes into the minutes of extra time. the out-swinging cross from bryan gil the left side met the argentine, who guided the header past the goalkeeper. it had to be in such an ideal placement given szczesny's performance in the game. juventus played cross after cross over those last several minutes. none of it tested bounou. the spanish side is through to its seventh europa league final, even if it will be without marcos acuna due to his red card. the kings of the competition have never lost in a europa league final, and roma has the challenge of ending that run. includes: premier league + sports channels includes: bundesliga & la liga includes: champions league & serie a includes: premier league includes: every mls game and leagues cup world soccer talk (c) . made in florida. world soccer talk is reader-supported and may earn a commission through our partner links.'}",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-18T21:41:41Z

" mikel arteta's side have shown incredible progress, resilience and quality to bounce back from last year's heartbreak of missing out on the champions league to mount a title challenge that few predicted at the start of the campaign. once the spaniard licks his wounds and reflects, he will no doubt have immense pride at how his young side have developed over the past months. it's expected to be a big summer for the club as they prepare for their first champions league campaign in seven years, with a sizeable squad overhaul on the horizon. reports claim the gunners will have upwards of PSm to spend as they loosen the purse strings, plus any money raised from the sale of several first team and squad members. mikel arteta is planning a major squad overhaul after arsenal's title challenge imploded it has been a fantastic season for the gunners but arteta (right) is keen to improve his options reiss nelson is out of contract at the end of the campaign and has rejected any new offers so far as he seeks more first team football, while kieran tierney, rob holding and emile smith rowe could move on after struggling for gametime. meanwhile, PSm-rated folarin balogun - who has enjoyed a fine season on loan in ligue at reims - is attracting interest from around europe and is reluctant to return to the gunners in a bit-part role. surprisingly, granit xhaka could also be allowed to move on, with bayer leverkusen having a concrete interest in the swiss star. the gunners have been linked with several players including declan rice, wilfried zaha, moussa diaby, moises caicedo and marc guehi. there were several memorable moments for arsenal as they launched a shock title challenge with clean sheets this season in games, aaron ramsdale has enjoyed a fine year in net for the gunners with several stunning saves regularly keeping his team in games. at the age of , he is still relatively young for a goalkeeper and the former sheffield united and bournemouth stopper will be a pillar of this side for years to come. he's been guilty of a few errors of late but ramsdale is still highly rated and will be hopeful of claiming the england no jersey soon. aaron ramsdale has enjoyed a fine campaign and will be arsenal's no. for several years despite being a natural centre back, ben white has looked at home on the right side of defence this season and has featured in every single league game. white had to endure a difficult moment after leaving the world cup with england 'due to personal reasons', but he has more than bounced back. ben white has also impressed and has made the right back spot his own for arteta's outfit you only have to look at the stats before and after his back injury to see the importance of william saliba to arsenal. having started the first games of the season, arsenal had points and had only conceded goals. in the nine games he has been absent for, arsenal have amassed only points and alarmingly conceded goals as their title challenge imploded. it has been a superb first season in the first team squad for saliba after numerous loans away from the club and provided he can return from injury, the -year-old will be integral fo arteta next year. willliam saliba, , has enjoyed a fine breakout campaign after several loan spells in france ever since moving to crystal palace from chelsea in for PSm, marc guehi has impressed and he has regularly captained the eagles this year. guehi's form saw him break into the england squad in and he has since won three caps for the three lions. arsenal's scouts have been impressed by guehi in a position where the gunners have badly struggled in the absence of saliba. arsenal are eyeing-up a move for crystal palace and england defender marc guehi, while gabriel magalhaes has been a reliable presence, he has been guilty of making costly errors at key moments during the title run-in, such as conceding a penalty against west ham in the - draw. meanwhile, their lack of depth at centre back has been exposed with rob holding and jakub kiwior struggling at times and guehi would provide a quality option. at the age of , he is a star of the present and the future and would be an astute pick up, although he could cost up to PSm. both jakub kiwior (left) and rob holding (right) have struggled to fill the void in defence in the absence of william saliba despite their title challenge imploding in recent weeks, the leadership and quality of oleksandr zinchenko has been a major plus point for arteta this season. he's been vocal and a character in arsenal's squad - while providing a solid and reliable option at left-back, keeping kieran tierney out of the team. arsenal's PSm move for the -year-old defender has paid off and his ability to tuck inside into their midfield is an integral part of the gunners' attacking play and will continue to be so as he enters the peak years of his career. oleksandr zinchenko's (left) leadership and passion has been a major part of arsenal's success still only , rice has already racked up appearances for the hammers along with england caps and he will be a hugely exciting addition for whoever acquires him. if they were able to complete the transfer, rice would provide an instant injection of quality in the gunners' midfield, and an upgrade on xhaka - who himself has been so impressive this season. at the age of , the ecuadorian will only get better and could be an integral member for the gunners for the next decade if he was to move. with thomas partey's form dipping towards the back end of this season and jorginho and xhaka not getting any younger, there is a clear need to replenish the club's midfield stocks. and the prospect of rice and caicedo together at the base of the midfield is an extremely mouthwatering one. it is hard to put into words the impact bukayo saka has had for arsenal this year with the hale end academy product a symbol of arteta's burgeoning young side. with goals and assists in premier league games, saka is in the running for various end of season awards and like several others, will no doubt be a staple of the first team for years to come. bukayo saka continues to impress for both arsenal and england despite still being only along with saka, the impact of club captain martin odegaard has been simply phenomenal, with the norwegian providing goals and eight assists in the league. he tends to lead with his performances rather than by cajoling his team-mates, but at , odegaard is another symbol of an arsenal team with an extremely bright future. the gunners have had a lot of hit-and-miss skippers over the years but with odegaard, they look in good hands. arsenal captain martin odegaard (left) has led from the front with his performances this year gabriel martinelli and leandro trossard might have something to say about it after fine seasons respectively, but the gunners are reportedly keen on a move for bayer leverkusen and france star moussa diaby. having broken through at psg, before moving on due to a lack of gametime, he is inherently talented, emphasised by his nine caps for france. PSm-rated diaby has goal contributions in games for his club side since joining in and he would no doubt add more depth to arteta's attacking options. this would be particularly pertinent given fringe attackers eddie nketiah and reiss nelson are likely to be among those who move on in the summer. PSm-rated bayer leverkusen star moussa diaby has been linked with a move to arsenal crystal palace icon wilfried zaha is another player who could be one of the most sought-after premier league stars this summer given he is yet to decide on his future ahead of his contract at selhurst park expiring. the ability to pick-up a proven premier league goalscorer on a free would be a fine piece of business despite zaha being aged . arsenal are one of several clubs keeping an eye on wilfried zaha ahead of his contract expiring while his preferred position is on the left wing, zaha has also featured up-front in recent years and that may be the best position for him at arsenal given the quality of options out wide. although jesus does have a key role in the gunners' build-up play by dropping deep, zaha would be more of a willing runner in behind and would provide another useful attacking option for arteta as he looks to go one better next season. our full arsenal xi features guehi at the back, rice and caicedo in midfield and zaha and diaby in attack share what you think",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-17T17:05:00Z

"play now men\'s brackets play now women\'s brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop with goals in ligue this season, reflecting a superb decision to move to france that he himself was the driving force of, balogun has become one of europe\'s most talked about and coveted young forwards. the attention on him will only intensify now that he profiles to be the usmnt\'s starting striker at their home world cup. where could he start the - campaign? let\'s take a look: once his loan spell at reims ends, balogun will return to arsenal a player with a dramatically different standing and expectations than the one who departed. the gunners have long thought highly of the year old, but they and he accept the reality of his situation after a breakout campaign. balogun wants regular first team football. arsenal cannot offer him any guarantees in that regard with gabriel jesus established as their no. and mikel arteta keen to add to his attacking options this summer. that is likely to take the form of a versatile forward who can play across the frontline with moussa diaby and mohammed kudus figuring prominently among the players they are considering. and all that is even before considering current arsenal backup, eddie nketiah. ultimately balogun is viewed as among arsenal\'s more likely departures in a summer where they will be looking to fund an injection of quality that would include two new midfielders and reinforcements in defense. a price tag of around PS million goes a fair way to funding a move like declan rice from west ham. in a summer where they will be looking to replace the goals of chelsea-bound christopher nkunku, leipzig have balogun on a list of targets that also includes canada\'s jonathan david. ultimately the decision may well come down to cash with lille expected to demand a fee of around EUR million for david, contracted until , whilst balogun\'s fee would be more within reach. leipzig are said to have balked at arsenal\'s initial demands for the year old but their interest has not faded. balogun also profiles as a decent fit for what might be considered rb\'s traditional approach (if such a concept is possible for a club repurposed for the needs of an energy drinks conglomerate). with reims he has excelled in a counter-attacking system that gets him the ball moving swiftly up the field and putting him in a position for close range finishes. leipzig have oscillated in their commitment to a similar approach but under marco rose seem to have settled on a more direct approach. a side that plays the right football, has a space in attack, can likely offer champions league football and has need for a center forward? leipzig certainly tick all the boxes for balogun. if balogun really wants to test himself at the highest level on a weekly basis then it would have to be the premier league. west ham, brentford and wolverhampton wanderers are among the clubs who have been tracking his progress at reims but perhaps only the latter could offer him decent assurances of a starting role on a weekly basis. crystal palace, meanwhile, have been linked with a move and have swiftly developed a reputation for coaxing swift growth out of talented youngsters like balogun. the opportunity to test himself at the highest level would be a double-edged sword however. balogun may be scoring for fun in ligue but there is quite the step required from the french top flight to its english counterpart. many players have taken that stride with ease, many more have not and have fallen foul to a competition that prioritises development only when there is not relegation to worry about or european qualification to dream of. balogun has also been linked with several clubs from serie a. ac milan hold a strong interest in him but are not in a position to commit to any big money moves at the moment, given that they cannot be sure whether they will be playing in the champions league this season, a matter which is as much up to the governing bodies judging juventus as it is stefano pioli\'s side. inter milan have also been linked with him while napoli could well find themselves in the market for a striker and with money to burn if victor osimhen departs. one thing is for sure, he will certainly not be short of takers. while that will be good news for arsenal it will pose quite the conundrum for balogun. if his move to reims is anything to go on though, he can be trusted to make the right call.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-16T17:32:33Z

" ""the gunners squad overperformed this season and the head coach must replace the senior figures likely to be moving on it felt like a throwback to darker days when mikel arteta, wan and downcast, faced the media after his side's destruction by brighton. there have been few reasons for dejection this season and, even after draws or defeats, he has generally emphasised the sunny aspects of arsenal's revival. this time, though, there was the clear sense a title dream had died and the note arteta struck was bleak. ""if a team is capable of doing that when it comes to the biggest stage, there's a lot of things to analyse and think about because it cannot happen,"" he said ominously, subsequently reiterating they were short of the level needed to compete for honours domestically and in the champions league. the difference is stark, although some degree of tail-off might have been expected from a young team in that position for the first time. it will make frustrating reading for arteta, who could bemoan injuries but knows they cannot account for everything. gabriel jesus and william saliba have been missed at different points of the campaign, and takehiro tomiyasu's versatility would have come in useful this spring. yet the treatment room has never been overflowing and the squad must be better stocked if they are to see the job through in future. numbers have been less of a problem than quality. saliba required a higher-grade deputy than rob holding or jakub kiwior, although the latter's performances in recent weeks have shown genuine promise; out wide there is no semblance of serious competition for bukayo saka, who has been muted of late; fabio vieira is not ready to swap in regularly for martin odegaard if required; up front there appears a vacancy for a striker of real stature who can present an alternative to jesus; and at left-back kieran tierney, a fine player but incomparable to oleksandr zinchenko in arteta's preferred buildup, has seen the team evolve beyond him. to keep up the pace in -, arteta will need better alternatives, individuals whose rotation into the side will not diminish the effectiveness. that will mean more established players and, in order to attract them, a greater willingness from the manager to chop and change. he wants saka to be capable of playing more than games a season but it would surely do no harm if someone of comparable gifts, maybe bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby, were ready to start at least a third of them. perhaps jesus would take less of a buffeting if a first-rate centre-forward were available to soften up defences when deemed necessary. saliba, who is yet to agree a new contract, could do with cover of equivalent virtuosity. arsenal should bring in more than PSm if tierney, holding, xhaka and the unfortunate emile smith rowe depart along with well-regarded younger players such as folarin balogun and charlie patino. their transfer window pot is expected to be substantial and arteta will search for additions who hit the sweet spot between ready-made talent and a higher ceiling. kick off your evenings with the guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion perhaps he will also wonder whether opponents figured out elements of arsenal's approach at the halfway mark. they have been vulnerable to an aggressive press in recent weeks and, with that, sloppy in building from the back. goals conceded against southampton and brighton, along with what may have been a season-changing penalty award for west ham a month ago, were directly linked to errors in first-phase buildup. further forward jesus has spent much of his time marshalled into less dangerous areas and saka, while a huge threat going inside or out, has more often been ushered to the byline on his weaker right foot than permitted to cut inside and let rip with his left. in a league of few secrets, arteta must conjure up fresh surprises. next year they can expect an enhanced threat from newcastle and it is impossible to imagine at least one of manchester united, liverpool, tottenham and chelsea not straightening up. ""you have to do a lot of good things, incredible things, to be second in this league, and we've done that,"" arteta said before returning to problem-solving mode. history will agree with him but it may also judge arsenal's long-term viability as contenders by their response to the near miss that so dispirited the manager.""}",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-15T14:57:27Z

" ""play now men's brackets play now women's brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop twenty years on from his first european triumph, the jose mourinho template is still paying dividends. let the opposition have the ball. let them make the mistakes. bayer leverkusen were totally free to drive themselves to distraction at the stadio olimpico, a team eager to play the match at pace dragged into a turgid, tetchy affair they could never win. now mourinho finds himself minutes away from another european final with roma, a chance to go back-to-back with first conference league and then europa league. he will be the last person who needs reminding that he has never lost any of his previous five continental finals. he probably does not need telling that another european crown would give him more than pep guardiola, louis van gaal and zinedine zidane. on the basis of thursday's game, roma are eminently capable of progressing to budapest solely off the back of edoardo bove's snapped effort on the hour. they might have allowed leverkusen to have -plus percent of the possession but for minutes of this game, rui patricio had only a solitary save to make. roma spoiled, they clipped and they needled but their defense was diligent and they posed a continuous threat off set pieces. by the final whistle, they had left bayer leverkusen with a sense of bafflement and persecution, florian wirtz's sarcastic applause of the officials typical of the distraction to which mourinho can drive his opponents. it was not destined to go this way. early on leverkusen looked like they might have the guile to prise their hosts apart, their intricate play swiftly taking themselves ultimately they produced what might have been the best of the match inside the first minute, moussa diaby gliding from his perch on the right flank into midfield. florian wirtz took the attack on there, laying it wide to pierro hincapie. his cross to the edge of the box was met by a tame robert andrich effort, anything with a bit of ferocity might well have beaten patricio. wirtz was roma's cheap tormentor early on, beating three midfielders and combining with adam hlozek before rolling a shot wide of the near post. that seemed to be the prompt for mourinho to tighten up the defensive wall and though roma would occasionally press the leverkusen back three in a bid to force errors, they were more than prepared from then out to drop into a low block and challenge their visitors to charm a way to goal. it helped that the hosts carried by far the greater threat from set pieces, roger ibanez drawing a superb save from lukas hradecky off a lorenzo pellegrini free kick. roma were certainly prepared to play for dead ball opportunities and this game swiftly descended into a gritty affair where yellow cards were far more frequent than clear-cut shots on goal. as leverkusen pushed further forward, the gaps emerged for roma to dart through. a swift counter and tammy abraham found himself with his back to goal, spinning and clipping a well-struck shot towards the right corner. hradecky might have felt he could have done more than palm the shot straight back into a dangerous area with bove on hand to score his first european goal off the rebound. he might have had an extremely similar second soon after as hradecky parried an andrea belotti effort into the center of the penalty box. only once did the roma defense look like buckling, patricio spilling a regulation cross that landed at the feet of jeremie frimpong. bryan cristante was on hand to block on the line, his arms close enough to his chest that leverkusen appeals for a penalty were little more than the final prayer of a team who had only hope to cling to. come next week, mourinho will relish snuffing that out too.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-11T21:21:55Z

"play now men\'s brackets play now women\'s brackets pga tour and beyond see who to add and drop his players would be the first to acknowledge that. ""when he first came we were all down,"" says jeremie frimpong. ""he had to lift the team up."" that he certainly did. seven months later and leverkusen\'s horizons are utterly changed. before friday\'s dispiriting - derby loss to cologne, alonso\'s men were undefeated in all competitions since feb. . they have risen from the bundesliga graveyard and find themselves in the sunlit uplands of the european places. they have left it too late for a charge into the top four but they may not need that to qualify for the champions league anyway. thursday brings with it the first leg of their europa league semifinal against roma (live on paramount+), a chance to add just a second continental trophy for a club that has a reputation for being the nearly men of german football. ""it would mean everything,"" says frimpong. ""i don\'t think leverkusen have won a trophy in a long while. it feels like it\'s time. we\'re a good team, we should win a trophy. hopefully, it\'ll be this one."" how has alonso done it? one of the most elegant playmakers and progressive ball players of his generation started with the most basic principles, shoring up a defense that was leaking . goals per game under his predecessor gerardo seoane. some of leverkusen\'s early season difficulties were the result of individual errors from otherwhile reliable performers, a little from finishing variance at both ends of the pitch, particularly some off form from the likes of patrik schick and moussa diaby. those foundations are looking solid. under alonso, leverkusen have allowed opponents two fewer shots per game and their expected goals (xg) allowed has dropped from . to .. per game. the . non-penalty xg per shot their opponents were taking before friday\'s defeat gave die werkself the best mark in the top flight. that is quite some achievement for a team who were hardly known for their resilience even last season. only now that the backline is secure has alonso loosened the strings. their scoring dried somewhat in recent weeks with both wolfsburg and union berlin holding on to earn - draws at home to leverkusen; in the five game bundesliga winning streak that proceeded they scored . they are also the leading scorers of the europa league knockout stages with in six matches, ""we started to build that up through the middle and then up front with more ideas,"" says wirtz. ""how could we break down our opponents on the attacking third? how could we best utilize our strengths?"" ""i think i am at the level i was at before, in some areas, maybe even playing a little better,"" he said. ""that was always the goal from the beginning of recovery -- to get the best out of the rehab and be as ready as possible. ""i didn\'t have any doubts at all that i would be able to play good football again. i remember being quite shocked when the diagnosis came in [after the injury] and i was determined just to look forward and make the best of the situation. there was a lot of work to be done -- a lot of different things to focus on -- but it was always looking ahead, keeping an eye on being on the pitch again. just give everything to be back in your position."" wirtz is flowing and so are leverkusen. witness the ease with which he breezed through the union saint-gilloise defense in the first leg of the europa league quarterfinal, five defenders collapsing into the same patch of turf and the youngster simply stepping into a low shot into the bottom left corner, a crucial goal that kept his side from having to overturn a deficit in belgium. even he has to acknowledge that ""it all feels really easy out there for the time being. roma boss jose mourinho might feel confident in coming up with a defensive scheme to slow down wirtz alone but what can he do when he\'s also coming up against a devastating right flank of frimpong and diaby? between them, these two have goals in all competitions, of which have, rather remarkably, come from wing-back frimpong. both players rank among the five quickest in the bundesliga this season; diaby just shading the two even though his teammate seems to think the difference is sizeable. ""he\'s faster than me. have i tested it? i just know,"" says frimpong with the air of a man who is really not inclined to get involved in one of the few foot races he might not win. that explosive movement rather frees them up to take whatever unorthodox position best tests the defenders. under alonso, frimpong, for instance, will on occasion drift into more inverted positions to supplement the threat he poses down the byline. diaby\'s touch map, meanwhile, looks nothing like that of a so-called right winger, even in games where, according to transfermarkt, he starts on that flank. if all their opponents have no idea how to stop leverkusen\'s dynamic right flank it is perhaps no surprise that frimpong is at a loss to explain it too. ""how would i stop us? i don\'t know to be honest. is it impossible? no, but i don\'t know, it\'s a very fast attack. i guess you\'ll have to figure it out."" good luck mourinho. the question that leverkusen may well face once their europa league race is run, however, is the same one that faces all but the dozen or so richest teams across the continent. how long can we keep this all together? diaby is wanted by newcastle and arsenal. frimpong has been linked with a move to work alongside compatriot erik ten hag at manchester united. as for wirtz, there isn\'t a top club in europe that doesn\'t want him with liverpool, manchester city and barcelona firm admirers. ""i\'m here in leverkusen. we have a good team. we have a young team. i have a lot of friends. i am just fully concentrating on my tasks here. i have some of my own personal goals to accomplish here in leverkusen so i\'m really not looking or thinking about other clubs and instead just proving out there that i can be the best player that i can be in each game and helping the team win games,"" he said. ""they\'ve helped big time, not just me but you can tell from our results and the way we play that they\'ve done the same for the whole team,"" says the dutch wing back. ""the coach has made a big difference and the staff, we\'re just really grateful to have them and hopefully he can keep us going."" wirtz added, ""he really shows, even in practice, how good he can still play. he has so much experience on the field as a player, he really knows how to carry himself and give the guidance we need so our team can reach its full potential and so all of us are at full capacity. he\'s really putting it on himself so that the team is really locked in mentally and focused but also that we are physically there in full as well. ""the atmosphere has been great. we\'ve really come together as a team. we\'re giving all we can to be successful with the team."" a squad of fearless, explosive young talent now has a boss of whom you could say the same thing. that leap of faith leverkusen took on alonso looks to be an inspired decision.",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-10T11:04:33Z

" arsenal are planning big reinforcements this summer, as the mikel arteta revolution continues arsenal could be ready to part with a PS million star - who only joined months ago. that's according to one report, following the gunners' resurgence in the title race after back-to-back wins. arsenal were on a wretched run that looked to derail hopes of a first premier league trophy in years but have clawed back hope with victories against newcastle united and chelsea. integral to this recent improvement is a subtle change from mikel arteta, as he looks to give his team more control. while it's been good news for some, others may lose out from this tweak. for the past two fixtures, arteta has omitted thomas partey from the starting line-up, opting instead for jorginho at the base of midfield. partey has appeared as a substitute in both games, shoring up the midfield from a no. position. now, football.london are reporting that the change in style may affect fabio vieira, who moved from porto last summer for over PSm. a cultured playmaker, vieira has impressed sporadically but struggled in some respects to adapt to the physicality of the premier league. the report suggests that a beefing up of the arsenal midfield may leave the portuguese as a casualty and that he may have to depart on loan. arsenal also have emile smith rowe to return to the midfield, with the hale end academy graduate also an option on the left wing. vieira is valued at EURm by transfermarkt. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. luton town's pelly ruddock mpanzu makes history with promotion to premier league luton promoted to premier league after beating coventry on penalties at wembley by tom hancock may by mark white may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by conor pope may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may (c)",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-09T09:02:40Z

"dyche's men must prove they are no pushovers on the road, starting at stamford bridge this evening everton face a tough task over the next few matches, if they are to build on an impressive start under new boss sean dyche, which has seen the team pick up ten points from seven fixtures. tottenham hotspur, manchester united and fulham lie in wait, before an on-paper ""easier"" match with relegation rivals crystal palace. first up though, before the international break, is a trip to stamford bridge in saturday's late kickoff, to face graham potter's chelsea. the blues started the season off with a visit to goodison park, where they ground out a solid - win over an everton side unable to field a genuine centre forward (how times have changed). a patchy start, which saw the londoners win three and lose two of their first six in the league, in addition to an embarrassing opening to their european campaign, suffering defeat to unheralded dinamo zagreb, was enough for the new ownership group to pull the plug on tuchel, who had cut an unhappy figure for some months. boehly moved quickly. appointing the highly-regarded brighton & hover albion manager, graham potter as tuchel's replacement. now under pressure from fans and the media, potter again managed the lifeline of a win over crystal palace, but three draws on the bounce, followed by three defeats during which spell chelsea managed to score just one goal saw the manager seemingly on the brink of losing his job, even if publicly he enjoyed unwavering support from the boardroom. since then he's overseen a mini-revival, now standing at three wins, two in the league over shaky outfits in leeds united and leicester city, the other a round of champions league knockout of dortmund. coming off that - away victory over the foxes, which was nowhere near as clear cut as the scoreline suggests, chelsea sit in tenth place in the league table, with a negligible chance of a top four finish and the odds against any kind of european qualification. the question was: what would the intelligent, articulate, thoughtful new man do with a squad full of top-drawer talent, at a side possessing very high expectations and - at least during abramovich's reign - little leeway for anything resembling failure? after all, even with the consideration that he was operating under a tight budget in what was essentially a buy-to-sell club, in brighton, the englishman had a reputation for being streaky in terms of results, not something you'd expect a club such as chelsea to have much tolerance for. as it's worked out, under boehly the west londoners have allowed potter far more rope than the russian ex-owner would have found acceptable, so the -year old has (so far) been able to ride out some unimpressive results that would have seen him handed his p in previous campaigns. chelsea operate a big squad - typically loaning out large numbers of first team players as well as prospects from the academy - so integrating a half dozen new recruits, including EURm man enzo fernandez, mykhaylo mudryk (EURm) and joao felix (on loan from atletico madrid) into a team that already had seen seven major additions last summer, has complicated things even further. now potter had to juggle even more high-value assets, many of whom will not be happy sitting on the bench and fit them into whatever system he intended to go with. over the last few matches, the manager has cut his cloth somewhat, compromising his progressive values and implementing a more pragmatic approach, which has so far borne out reasonably well. we've seen chelsea come out fast, show lots of fluidity in attack and try to gain an early advantage, then, once this has been secured adopt a defensive posture. in a way it's not an awful lot different to what dyche has been about at everton, though considering the vast difference in squad quality and depth the londoners have over the merseyside outfit, this is quite a humbling shift. kai havertz has played more minutes than anyone else in a blue shirt this term but still is a player in search of a position. typically played through the middle - chelsea puzzlingly still being without a reliable centre forward despite the vast sums spent out - the german lined up on the right last time out. he's an intelligent player with good movement that appears better suited to a role of support striker. the forward has just six league goals this term, though has found the back of the net in chelsea's last two matches. everton have yet to convince under dyche away from goodison park, posting one draw (with nottingham forest) and two comprehensive defeats (to liverpool and arsenal) away from the comforts of home, scoring twice and conceding eight goals in the process. chelsea have not impressed themselves this term, despite an already top side being strengthened to the tune of a net spend of more than half a billion euros since the summer. it's probable that the hosts will line up in the -- we've seen them use recently and almost certain that everton will again go with a --. the only question over the visitors lineup is whether the manager will stick with centre half ben godfrey at left back, or revert to the fit-again vitalii mykolenko. this is going to be a cagey, tactical game. both teams will attempt to make a good start, get in front and then shut things down. although lacking a true striker, chelsea have a lot more goals in their team and the visitors will have to show all the organisational qualities they possess to shut them out. it's tough to see the toffees creating many chances from open play and they'll have to rely on the occasional counterattack, using demarai gray's pace, otherwise set-pieces will be the order of the day. the londoners still don't look entirely comfortable dealing with dead-ball saturations, so this may be everton's best route to goal. any mistakes by the visitors and it is game over, but i feel chelsea's revival of late is not suggestive of a genuine major improvement, so i'm going with the merseysiders getting something out of this match. prediction: chelsea - everton stats provided courtesy of fbref.com, transfermarkt.co.uk and whoscored.com gambling problem?

(nm) it sure sounds like someone different will join the chelsea goalkeeper competition next season. after the below reports that chelsea was eyeballing leeds' youngster illan meslier, there's more talk that the blues wants fresh blood between the posts. andre onana, , has been a shining star at inter milan and would be of interest to a great deal of teams should he hit the transfer market. fichajes says chelsea loves the idea of onana in london. and will chelsea's possible (probable?) failure to make the uefa champions league stop prospects from seeing stamford bridge as a - possibility? (nm) kepa arrizabalaga has taken the proverbial no. shirt from edouard mendy, and could that mean an exit for the senegalese goalkeeper as multiple reports say chelsea's informed mendy he can find a new home this summer. the -year-old mendy, of course, won the champions league with chelsea in but they're apparently happy to let him move on in the summer despite a contract settled through the - season. that much time left on a deal -- and status as senegal's no. goalkeeper -- should net chelsea some money and the blues may be ready to spend it right back on leeds united keeper illan meslier. meslier is just years old and made a huge impression on the premier league last season with leeds, though this season has seen ups-and-down for the club, kepa leads the league in save percentage but meslier is well off that pace. and only leicester's danny ward and southampton's (also young) gavin bazunu rate worse in goals prevented according to fotmob. football insider says $ million is leeds' asking price for meslier. (nm) world cup winner alexis mac allister is ""ready"" to leave brighton and hove albion this summer, and a host of premier league big boys want to secure his services. mac allister, , has been absolutely massive at brighton and his work as a feature player in argentina's world cup win only served to elevate his standing. chelsea, liverpool, newcastle, and spurs are linked with the most interest and each carries a reasonable link to mac allister but would any make more sense than a reunion with -year-old international teammate enzo fernandez? at some point chelsea is going to have to rein in the spending but the midfield still holds plenty of potential transfer energy with mateo kovacic linked with man city, n'golo kante injured and not getting any younger, and mason mount still yet to agree a new deal. mac allister is a hungry, complete, and forward-thinking midfielder who doesn't shy away from a tackle. he's a huge part of why the seagulls have been able to navigate so many sales and does seem likely, along with moises caicedo, to be the next to leave the amex stadium... especially if the brighton can't get european football.

'i'm a fast player, a crosser and box-to-box.' there's going to be change around everton, and chelsea may be taking advantage of it. this is all according to metro. at some point chelsea won't be able to spend more money but everton needs it and seemingly gordon's figure has dropped a little given his drop down the toffees' pecking order. it all seems wild, but this is chelsea in -. (nm) chelsea could be set to live life without pierre-emerick aubameyang and raheem sterling as reports circulate that barcelona would like to take ""auba"" back to spain and that the blues are open to offers for sterling this winter. the sterling sale would be stunning as new chelsea owner todd boehly is showing little patience when it comes to making things fit for new boss graham potter. who could afford sterling? very few, and sterling would not be able to help several clubs' champions league pushes. coming in would be psv eindhoven star noni madueke. the london-born winger came through the academies of crystal palace and tottenham before moving to psv at age . madueke, , has goals and assists in senior appearances for psv and is said to carry a $ million price tag. a right winger and attacking midfielder, madueke has. a tantalizing profile highlighted by dribbling, ball progression, and comfort in the attacking penalty area. he's not afraid of a tackle, relatively speaking, either. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

(nm) update: this deal has been confirmed by chelsea, dec. brazil u- starlet andrey santos is reportedly todd boehly's latest transfer swoop, according to multiple reports. santos, a central midfielder turns in may, has eight goals in serie b matches for vasco da gama in brazil. he's reportedly carrying a $ million price tag. chelsea previously added youngsters carney chukwuemeka and gabriel ""gaga"" slonina to the fold in the summer, and were linked with endrick earlier this month, but the player will instead join real madrid in the summer of . todd boehly is working hard to make sure his new manager gets his men, and graham potter will have former psg starlet and current leipzig star christopher nkunku come summer. french international nkunku, , missed the world cup with torn knee ligaments but had scored times with four assists in appearances across all competitions for leipzig early this season. when he's back fit and firing, it will likely be for the blues in the premier league rb leipzig duo christopher nkunku and josko gvardiol are both being lined up to arrive at chelsea next summer. a report from the athletic states that chelsea have offered to pay leipzig more than nkunku $ million release clause (which kicks in next summer) and want to wrap up a deal which would see the -year-old french international arrive at stamford bridge next summer. the report says that nkunku has already agreed to the deal, while our partners in the uk at sky sports believe the prolific striker (who has already scored six goals in eight bundesliga games this season) has yet to make up his mind. a story out of the netherlands says chelsea's sent waves through ajax camp with a $ million bid for mexico star edson alvarez. the report says that newcastle and rennes came calling for alvarez but ajax would not be moved, but this chelsea offer has seriously turned the player's head. alvarez, , operates as a central defensive midfielder but is not one-dimensional and has spent a little but of time at center back and a bit more more advanced, too. he's been a regular starter and will want regular playing time ahead of the world cup. chelsea can provide some given injuries and schedule congestion. (nm) according to fabrizio romano, chelsea and barcelona are locked in talks over deals for pierre-emerick aubameyang, , and marco alonso, . aubameyang will have extra medical checks after his jaw was reportedly broken by attackers on his home in barcelona earlier this week, while alonso has agreed personal terms with barca many months ago and has been waiting for the two clubs to agree a fee in a separate deal. (jpw) pierre aubameyang update. the two clubs are in direct contact today as they want to reach an agreement in the next hours -- been told that marcos alonso is again discussed as part of the deal. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc ready to give everything! :blue_heart:#fofanaischelsea a report from football insider claims that chelsea have offered conor gallagher and armando broja, plus $ million, for anthony gordon. the -year-old winger scored for the toffees in their - draw at brentford at the weekend and showcased his wonderful speed on the break and his incredible work rate. gallagher and broja have worked so hard on loan spells over the years but it just doesn't seem like they're gong to become regulars at chelsea under thomas tuchel. they could definitely be stars at everton and if the toffees get the duo (permanently or on loan) plus get a good chunk of cash for gordon, that is a very good deal for them. gordon is good but frank lampard and the everton board should snap chelsea's hand off. (jpw) wesley fofana, , is reportedly in the usa undergoing his chelsea medical as his transfer from leicester city edges closer. the athletic are reporting that fofana flew to the u.s. on sunday as chelsea's co-owner todd boehly wanted extra checks after fofana fractured his leg at the start of last season. it is believed chelsea and fofana have agreed terms on a six-year deal, as the transfer fee with leicester could rise to almost $ million.

(jpw) a report from the guardian says that chelsea have renewed their interest in wilfried zaha as the crystal palace winger has less than a year left on his current contract. zaha, , has been linked with chelsea, tottenham and arsenal on multiple occasions over the years and a report from the independent says his agent is pushing for a move to chelsea. the guardian says that pierre-emerick aubameyang is still chelsea's top target but zaha is another option. it seems like chelsea and leicester city have finally agreed a fee for wesley fofana, as the athletic believe an agreement is in place. chelsea badly want, and need, a new center back and fofana, , will be perfect for their system and style of play. he has been left out of training at leicester in recent days after having his head turned and on the eve of chelsea hosting leicester (fofana will not be playing) the two clubs have agreed a fee. it is believed that fee will be a world-record for a defender and fofana is worth it. (jpw) a report from cbs sports says that chelsea and barcelona are close to agreeing a $. million fee for pierre-emerick aubameyang. the -year-old is closing in on a reunion with thomas tuchel and a return to london and the premier league. given barcelona's financial situation, and their plethora of new attacking talents, letting aubameyang go makes sense. chelsea need a clinical finisher to put away the chances tuchel's side create game after game and having auba, raheem sterling and mason mount in attack is a very good trio. this will give chelsea's attack a ruthless edge, which they badly need, and will be a huge boost in their push for a top four finish. (jpw) aubameyang to chelsea is now very close and is a straight-cash deal. leicester manager brendan rodgers is expected to leave wesley fofana out of his matchday squad when the foxes face southampton on saturday, as the -year-old center back tries to force through a transfer to chelsea. the blues have had two previous bids for the frenchman rejected, but new owner todd boehly has thus far been undeterred. this isn't quite the point of no return for fofana, but the developing saga is trending that direction. (ae) chelsea are set to step up their pursuit of pierre-emerick aubameyang, as a meeting is scheduled to discuss doing a deal for aubameyang. per the report from fabrizio romano, chelsea will soon make their opening bid to barcelona for aubameyang as the -year-old is a top target in the final weeks of the transfer window. according to multiple reports out of the uk, chelsea offered everton $. million for -year-old midfielder anthony gordon, the breakout star and a rare bright spot in the toffees' - season, but the blues were swiftly rejected with a further bid expected in the not-so-distant future. when it comes to chelsea, are they overpaying for players this summer? marc cucurella, raheem sterling and kalidou koulibaly have all arrived for huge transfer fees and it seems like chelsea's new owners are paying somewhat of a premium because they are, well, chelsea's new owners. todd boehly is getting a lot of stick for paying over the odds and only time will tell if cucurella, fofana and co. are worth these huge transfer fees. the focus at chelsea will likely now be on selling players and they will have to move on a lot of fringe players to offset this huge spending spree. (jpw) chelsea are willing to go to PSm for fofana and believe that would be enough to get him. would take their spending over PSm and could be more beyond that (fdj, casadei, auba targeted). so are they going to be able to make anything back on sales? #cfc chelsea\'s latest bid for wesley fofana is over PSm and won\'t be the last one made if rejected. brendan rodgers again said fofana isn\'t for sale, but todd boehly means business. fofana is chelsea\'s number one target between now and when window shuts. longtime chelsea leader and captain cesar ""dave"" azpilicueta is not going back to spain after all. meanwhile, football.london says that brighton manager graham potter has removed marc cucurella from first-team training amid reports of a fee agreement with chelsea. now that agreement has been denied by brighton, but it does make it seem like cucurella is moving closer to getting his transfer request. keep an eye on this space. (nm) would aubameyang be a good fit for chelsea? he would fit their system and we know he's a great finisher. aubameyang could also add plenty of experience to a very youthful attack and if he's happy and teams are playing to his strengths. thomas tuchel will be wary of aubameyang potential throwing his toys out of the pram like he did at arsenal but the player and coach know each other extremely well from their time together at borussia dortmund, which was hugely successful for auba. blue suits you, @chukwuemekaa! :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: read all about it! #chukwuemekaischelsea marc cucurella to chelsea, here we go! full agreement in place between chelsea and brighton for more than PSm. levi colwill on the verge of joining brighton soon. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc chelsea has added a pair of highly-rated teenagers this tuesday. usmnt goalkeeper gabriel ""gaga"" slonina will carry a bit more interest in america, where the teenager has been unveiled by chelsea on a six-year deal that includes a loan back to chicago for the rest of the mls season [ more info here ] then there's england youth international carney chukwuemeka, the -year-old who was willing to run down his contract at aston villa. rather than lose him for nothing in next summer, steven gerrard's villans have sold chukwuemeka to the blues for a reported $ million. not a bad return. (nm) chelsea are pushing to hijack marc cucurella deal! direct talk today with brighton - levi colwill could be part of the negotiation. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc so, is this actually going to happen!? it seems like this deal for -year-old usmnt goalkeeper gabriel slonina has dragged on and on, but there is no real rush on either side as slonina will be heading back to the chicago fire on loan. as we've said below, slonina will eventually head to chelsea over the next year or so and his next step is to head out on loan in europe. the american goalkeeper has a very bright future and this is a good move for him to enter the european market and have a huge club like chelsea handling his development. (jpw) gabriel slonina's agent jaime garcia has informed chicago fire that they reached an agreement on personal terms with chelsea. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc cfc will submit official bid and send paperworks, after verbal agreement with chicago: m plus add-ons. manchester city internal decision: oleksandr zinchenko can leave the club, arsenal are prepared to submit an official proposal. :police_car_light: #afc nathan ake stays at the club after talk with guardiola despite personal terms agreed with chelsea. #mcfc kalidou koulibaly to chelsea, here we go! full agreement in place for EURm fee add-ons completed, bid accepted. napoli are checking the documents then it will be official. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc he\'s here! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:#sterlingischelsea would gnabry slot in well at chelsea? everything suggests so. he is versatile, clinical in the final third and along with sterling would give chelsea's attacking unit a totally different look. tuchel prefers to play without a target forward and sterling and gnabry could start underneath havertz, or one of them could even start up top with mason mount in the attacking midfield position. gnabry would give tuchel flexibility and the german coach loves that from his team. gnabry doesn't appear to be closer to agreeing a new contract at bayern munich and chelsea could take advantage of that situation. (jpw) how big of a priority is center back for chelsea? in a word, huge. after losing antonio rudiger to real madrid and andreas christensen to barcelona on free transfers, captain cesar azpilicueta could also be heading to barca and that leaves chelsea very short in defense. ake and koulibaly would be perfect fits for chelsea's --- system and koulibaly would be a very good direct replacement for antonio rudiger. koulibaly will be expensive but he does have just one year left on his contract at napoli and the -year-old may feel like now is the time to take his talents to the premier league after what seems like constant links in every single transfer window of the last five years. (jpw) chelsea have reached verbal agreement with chicago fire for gabriel slonina, after direct talks between todd boehly and mls club. m deal plus add-ons, he\'d stay at chicago on loan. :blue_circle: #cfc should chelsea cash in on kante now? they will likely get close to $ million for him if they sold him this summer and the french international struggled increasingly with injuries last season. when he's fit and firing on all cylinders there are still few defensive midfielders better than him in the world but it seems like thomas tuchel wants to freshen up his midfield options with jorginho also coming towards the end of his contract at stamford bridge and plenty of replacements, such as matheus nunes and frenkie de jong, have been linked with chelsea in recent weeks. (jpw) raheem sterling has agreed to join chelsea after seven seasons at manchester city, according to multiple reports. the -year-old england star would move with the world cup coming up, and the move could alter the club futures for fellow international stars christian pulisic, timo werner, and hakim ziyech. what would this transfer mean for chelsea? more details and analysis, here. (nm) a report from the athletic claims that chelsea chairman todd boehly has been in talks with jorge mendes about a potential deal for cristiano ronaldo. ronaldo, , has reportedly told united he wants to move on this summer and he did not turn up for the first day of preseason due to 'family reasons' as it appears his second spell at old trafford is coming to an abrupt end. per this report, chelsea are exploring if they could do a deal for ronaldo but there are apparently some hestitations from thomas tuchel about ronaldo being a good fit for the blues. would this work? firstly, it would be shocking if man united sold ronaldo to a direct top four rival in the premier league. why would they do that? ronaldo is under contract for another season so they would rather keep him against his will for one season rather than strengthen a rival. secondly, it's quite clear that ronaldo would score plenty of goals at chelsea but would his arrival upset the balance of the squad as it did at united? the second point is wading into muddy waters as chelsea have had success in bringing in a superstar veteran (thiago silva) and if ronaldo is willing to work with their talented youngsters, he will get plenty of chances to score. chelsea need a new no. after loaning out romelu lukaku and ronaldo wants to play in the champions league, which chelsea are in. on the face of it, this makes sense for everyone aside from manchester united. that is the big problem. (jpw) once a chelsea prospect, dutch defender nathan ake is wanted by thomas tuchel for the first team at stamford bridge. the -year-old ex-bournemouth star has not played as much as he'd like at manchester city but the premier league champions rate him much higher than the proposed chelsea bid. the blues are said to be willing to offer around $ million, about half of the reported city valuation. what fee would it take to get city to sell a player to a would-be title rival. if gabriel jesus moved to london for $ million, albeit with less time on his deal, perhaps that's nearer to the bullseye. (nm) full story this time around, lukaku scored goals in appearances (all competitions - in in the premier league), bringing his chelsea career total to goals. in total, chelsea have paid roughly $ million for lukaku. quick math says, $ million per goal. (ae) the todd boehly revolution is well underway at stamford bridge, where brazilian attacker raphinha is set to arrive from leeds united. it's a deal that could reach $ million, according to fabrizio romano, and certainly loads up jesse marsch's transfer kitty at leeds. this, of course, assumes that chelsea can come to an agreement on a contract with raphinha, who has also been linked with barcelona and arsenal. raphinha scored times with three assists for leeds last premier league season, a year after scoring six times and adding nine assists following a transfer from stade rennais. a report from the telegraph states that chelsea boss thomas tuchel has reached out directly to raheem sterling to discuss a possible move to stamford bridge this summer. the england international, , could well be surplus to requirements at manchester city next season and chelsea need to freshen up their attack. with romelu lukaku on his way to inter milan, hakim ziyech in talks over a loan move to ac milan and timo werner likely leaving too, it's clear that tuchel wants to rebalance his attack and sterling is one of his top targets. per the report, city value sterling at $- million and chelsea will now make a bid after tuchel spoke directly with the player. would this be a good move for both sterling and chelsea? probably. sterling has been a star at man city over the last seven seasons but he probably isn't appreciated as much as he should be and with erling haaland and julian alvarez arriving this summer at city, the speedy winger will face even stiffer competition for a starting spot. he struggled for minutes a little last season ( compared to in -) but his quality is clear for all to see. the way he stretches teams on the break and cuts inside would suit tuchel's --- system well, as sterling could play as the central striker or as one of the two underneath forwards. sterling has just one year left on his current contract at city and with gabriel jesus set to leave this summer for arsenal, are city going to allow both to move on? maybe. they have always been pretty good at letting players move on if they want to but pep guardiola may feel a little shorthanded if both sterling and jesus leave this summer. (jpw) per the report, ronaldo was discussed and chelsea are interested in seeing whether or not he can be temped to west london. given that he only has one year left on his contract and they'd be strengthening a direct top four rival, united would surely rather keep ronaldo than sell him to chelsea this summer. united have since briefed plenty of outlets, including our partners in the uk at sky sports, that ronaldo is not for sale and will not leave this summer. a report from our partners at sky italy states that hakim ziyech could head on loan to ac milan in a similar deal which will see romelu lukaku move to inter from chelsea. per the report, ziyech is keen on the move and he has been a target for ac milan for some time. the moroccan winger has never really settled at chelsea despite the odd sublime goal and stunning display. with tuchel looking to freshen up his attack this summer, ziyech, werner, lukaku and even christian pulisic appear to be surplus to requirements as tuchel expects plenty of new arrivals under the new ownership group led by chelsea chairman todd boehly. according to a separate report from the telegraph the blues boss expects up to six new players to arrive at stamford bridge this summer. with de ligt, raheem sterling, richarlison and ousmane dembele strongly linked with a move to chelsea, this is going to be a very different looking side, especially in attack. (jpw) a report from di marzio in italy suggests that timo werner plus $ million is the offer chelsea have put forward for juventus defender matthijs de ligt but the turin club want werner and closer to $ million. per the report both werner and de ligt are up for the move, with the dutch center back set to be the new center-piece of thomas tuchel's defense, while werner is keen for a fresh start in italy as his goalscoring woes in the premier league continue. would this be a good move for all parties? de ligt has been much better in recent seasons at juve but he has struggled at times and perhaps the premier league would suit his game slightly better. as for werner, well, he's beloved by the chelsea fans for his incredible effort in games but his finishing has really let him down and if he moves on now he can leave with his head held high. (jpw) juventus center back matthijs de ligt's $ million release clause and its expectation not to budge much from the price tag may not stop chelsea, according to sky sports. the blues are pursuing the -year-old dutch star, having lost antonio rudiger and andreas christensen this summer. chelsea has to address the crew of thiago silva, malang sarr, and trevoh chalobah. de ligt cost juventus about $ million from ajax. amongst defenders, only virgil van dijk, harry maguire, and lucas hernandez have cost more than de ligt's transfer fee then and only four players have cost more than his current release clause, which expires in . should it happen, this would be huge splash from new chairman todd boehly? (nm). richarlison can certainly do that and given his experience in the premier league and his tenacity and work-rate, he seems like a very good fit for tuchel's --- system at chelsea as he could play up top or in one of the two underneath positions. the transfer fee is going to be sizeable (probably $- million) but richarlison has been consistent at everton and there's reason to believe he will create and score plenty of goals in a team who are on the front-foot more often. (jpw) would this be a good move for chelsea, and sterling? it seems like a pretty good fit and if chelsea can drive down the price a little, they will go all-in for sterling. that said, city could be selling to potential title rivals so they will want a big transfer fee. sterling is not really and out-and-out winger and tuchel doesn't like to play with pure wingers in his --- system. he would be very good on the left of the two forwards underneath a central striker and he loves to cut inside and cause havoc. even though sterling gets a bad rep for missing big chances he has still scored goals in all competitions for man city over the last three seasons. that's goals per season and chelsea need someone what that production in their forward line as christian pulisic, timo werner and hakim ziyech have all struggled to stay fit and in-form. with erling haaland arriving this summer at city, sterling could well struggle for playing time this season at city and he has been in and out of the team over the last months. he could play centrally at chelsea, as the report suggests, and tuchel is said to be a big fan of sterling. add in all of that to the fact that sterling grew up in west london and his family connections are in the area and it all kind of makes sense, right? (jpw) if that move doesn't happen due to barca's financial situation, christensen will not be short of options. with the futures of cesar azpilicueta, marcos alonso, romelu lukaku and several other forwards (see below) uncertain, it is building up to be a very intriguing summer at chelsea. and, oh yeah, they also have new billionaire owners who are keen to make their mark.

" arsenal have been linked extensively with declan rice - but according to one former player, they may not break the bank for him arsenal won\'t be paying over the odds for declan rice, according to one former star. the north londoners have been linked with a huge move for the west ham united captain, with a figure as big as PS million touted. arsenal eight points clear at the top of the table, likely to qualify for the champions league next season and will likely invest heavily in their squad this summer. but despite more money being available to manager mikel arteta, one former gunner says that the club won\'t be paying any more for rice than what they believe him to be worth. the former croatia international who spent three seasons in the premier league hastened to add that should arsenal spend nine figures on rice, it would be so because they felt that the player was worthy of that fee. ""however, if they were going to spend PSm on declan rice, that must mean the club thinks that he is worthy of that value,"" he added. despite thinking that the gunners could spend a lot of money this summer, eduardo added that it wouldn\'t be a ""crazy"" window for the club. ""they may sell some players and if they do, they will surely need to replace them,"" eduardo said. ""however, if arsenal keep the same team next season, i don't think they will go crazy in the transfer window. they may buy a young player and mould him to fit their ideologies, but we will have to wait and see."" rice is valued at EURm by transfermarkt (opens in new tab). thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. kylian mbappe top of sheikh jassim\'s manchester united shortlist, should he become new owner: report tottenham report: paulo dybala could join from roma for just PS million brighton vs manchester united live stream, match preview, team news and kick-off time for this premier league match by ryan dabbs may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by ed mccambridge may by ryan dabbs may by mark white may (c)",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-03-20T14:32:33Z

(nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low. (nm) de zerbi: ""caicedo is a good guy. we will see. we hope he stays with us but this question for the club and moises"":police_car_light: #bhafc #afc excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

" ""there is a lot to like about cody. he is still only years old but he already has a lot of experience. he was the captain of psv, he was the player of the year in holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great world cup with his national team. so, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him."" there could hardly be a better time for this move whether you're discussing in terms of the club or the player. injuries to luis diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and gakpo certainly showed at the world cup that he's on his game. might this be the difference for the reds as they charge onward in both the premier league's top four race and the uefa champions league? more at liverpoolfc.com. (nm) what did @virgilvdijk tell cody gakpo about the club before the move? :thinking_face: psv and @lfc have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of cody gakpo. the -year-old attacker will leave for england imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. ""it is an unbelievable place to be. in my eyes, probably one of the best -- if not the best -- clubs in the world at the minute. the opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. ""obviously, i have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things i still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. i have got more to learn and the time to do that. the incredible journey continues :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:#salahstays ramsay is a red :raising_hands::red_circle: the reds came so close to the quadruple in - so improving this squad will not be easy but after a shaky premier league campaign so far, they need some more depth, especially in midfield. given their current owners looking for extra investment, it will be intriguing to see which direction they head in over the next few transfer windows. below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on liverpool transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. according to a report from the mirror, liverpool held talks just last week with representatives for bayern munich midfielder ryan gravenberch. the sides reportedly came to a loose agreement on contract terms for a summer move, with a transfer fee still needing to be agreed between the clubs. gravenberch joined bayern from ajax last summer, but the -year-old has reportedly grown frustrated by his lack of playing time and would like to leave this summer. also last week, liverpool pulled out of the race for jude bellingham, with a pair of starting central midfielders a high priority for jurgen klopp's side. (ae) liverpool is looking to brighton and real madrid to fix their midfield. so say the sunday papers, with spanish site revelo claiming that liverpool is ready to duel with chelsea to land alexis mac allister from brighton. and catalan site el nacional says liverpool wants to build around aurelien tchouameni, as the real star is playing but not featuring as much as expected in madrid after his move from monaco. mac allister's shown he can star in the premier league and the world cup winner won't come cheap. and might he want to stick around brighton if the seagulls and liverpool are in the same european competition or, perhaps, if brighton's in the superior competiton? as for tchouameni, you have to ask the same questions. no, he's not a nailed-on starter in a brilliant midfield behind eduardo camavinga, but he'd playing plenty at age and on a perennial champions league contender. mac allister would seem the easier and less expensive -- not my much -- lure, but watch out for chelsea who already has his world cup-winning midfield mate enzo fernandez. (nm) bayer leverkusen phenom florian wirtz is back from a major knee injury and has shown he's fit and firing, recalled back into the germany set-up. fabrizio romano says liverpool is ready to rival barcelona and real madrid for his services, while min claims that man city, arsenal, tottenham, newcastle, bayern munich, and borussia dortmund are in the chase for wirtz. wirtz, , has a contract with leverkusen through the - season and his fee will be massive should he continue to show no ill effects of his acl injury. liverpool has a bevy of young attack-minded midfielders in harvey elliott and fabio carvalho, but wirtz is legitimately one of the most exciting prospects to come out of the bundesliga since kai havertz and timo werner came from leverkusen and stuttgart. football insider says that liverpool could turn to wolves for a pair of midfielders including club captain ruben neves. matheus nunes is also a target for jurgen klopp, according to the site, who says liverpool faces serious neves competition from newcastle united. barcelona is also going after neves, , who could slide into the blaugranas lineup and refresh the midfield for club legend sergio busquets. barca, of course, also has teen midfield phenoms gavi and pedri, and also currently boasts dutch star frenkie de jong. (nm) carlos baleba's only been in ligue for just over a year, but he's earned his way to the wishlist of jurgen klopp and several other premier league suitors. liverpool has been joined by arsenal, manchester united, newcastle, west ham, and leicester city in pursuit of baleba, who will cost near the $ million lille got from everton's amadou onana last summer. baleba as the joining harvey elliott and stefan bajcetic as s -- not to mention fabio carvalho -- would give klopp four midfielders under the age of . (nm) after eight years at anfield, roberto firmino will leave liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the current season. the -year-old brazilian has thus far scored goals in appearances since arriving from hoffenheim in the summer of . in his liverpool career, firmino has won the premier league, uefa champions league (twice a runner-up) and the fa cup. will mohamed salah end his anfield years if liverpool fails to make the uefa champions league? a report from fichajes says, yes, and jurgen klopp would be fine with it. liverpool has restocked its attacking cupboard with powerful (but snakebit so far) darwin nunez and cody gakpo joining luis diaz, and diogo jota in the team. calcio mercato says that the reds could also move on from diaz if it means landing ac milan star rafael leao in a swap deal. leao, , has eight goals and six assists across matches in serie a this season, and the left winger is one of the most sought-after players in the world. would you, if you were jurgen klopp? (nm) would he work better with inter milan's nicolo barella or bayern munich's ryan gravenberch? we may find out on at least one count. barella, , came up through the ranks at cagliari before moving to inter in . he's an elite playmaker and ball progressor who seeks to find spaces up the pitch to receive it, too. he has six goals and seven assists in appearances across all competitions this season, and he's up to caps with italy. gravenberch, , moved from ajax in the summer and has made appearances totaling minutes as of post time, scoring a goal and an assist in cup play against viktoria koln. before making the move, gravenberch was one of the most sought-after young players on the market. he's not on the same level as barella in ball movement but he's very good at creating shots and is a harder tackler and defensive presence than barella. liverpool's forward ranks have been turned over and its injury list has been long, but the reds' have been bossed in the midfield for large portions of this season and things may not be better until the summer. jurgen klopp's admitted as such, and he's known it a lot longer than real madrid's - embarrassment of his reds at anfield: his mentality monsters might still be confident but the system's not going to work without better players. in other words, you can't romanticize the relative efficiency of your club and also be mad about it, especially when a reputation is built on ""jurgen klopp doesn't miss on transfers"" but also you're missing on transfers. here are a whole lot of klopp quotes, via the liverpool echo: ""of course, we are not that dumb. it's not like, 'today is not good and now we have to change.' this is clear, it was always clear. this team has a wonderful history. the way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. our transfers always have to be on point. so that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club. ""last year was not a season for a big change. we played until the last moment. if you want to change again, this club, we can't just bring in new players and then realise later, 'oh, nobody wants to leave.' it doesn't work, it doesn't work like that. that's why it's not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. played the season until the last minute, played the champions league final. then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the world cup. ""all the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. and now we are in it and i know it's too long. for me it's too long because i have to always face you in the press conferences. believe me, i don't like to talk about it all the time. but i have to think it all the time. but that's not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because i don't have to read it the next day. that's the situation, i cannot change it. ""now the people are not happy. we try to fight through and make the best of this season, that's the idea. and stay in the period as good as a person as you can. if i said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. the more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless. ""but based on the way this club is led. it's obviously different to other clubs, that's how it is. but it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. let me say it like that. but that's something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. and for us, from my conversations with the owners. but that's it, nothing else. it's just work."" ins cody gakpo - psv eindhoven ($ million plus incentives) outs none england midfielder mason mount reportedly wants a raise from chelsea, who is loading up on young talent amidst its season struggles to stay in the top four mix. liverpool sees a good solution for the blues: sell mount to the red part of merseyside. the reds would love to bring mount to anfield and the player has only months left on his current deal at chelsea. one thing that hasn't often been mentioned about owner todd boehly's big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue. mount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an england national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also chelsea's desire to balance their books)? juventus is also linked by the guardian and chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for mount... but just something to put onto your radar. (nm) given liverpool's struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed jude bellingham is their preferred long-term target. they probably needs neves and bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. can we see this happening? it would be pretty crazy for wolves to sell neves this month as they battle against relegation. that said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell. (jpw) liverpool manager jurgen klopp is the mouthpiece for the club, and the mouthpiece for the club would like to stop answering questions about transfers. ""it must be a language issue,"" klopp said. ""it must be, that you ask these questions again and again and again,"" he told reporters, via the liverpool echo. ""i answered it already so often. we look outside as well. it's not that we are stubborn and think, 'that's it. we'll go with these boys until .' that's not how we see it."" klopp said he forgave the reporters because he knows they are being asked by their bosses to ask about transfers. liverpool has brought in darwin nunez, cody gakpo, and fabio carvalho on permanent deals while also loaning in arthur melo. last season, they bought luis diaz and ibrahima konate. the reds looked as mixed up as a hound's breakfast in their weekend loss to brighton, a setback that klopp implied was the worst performance of his managerial career. (nm) there are reports that ruben neves' contract situation at wolves could give liverpool its latest anfield discount. somehow, the reds have been able to land players below market price rather often but this one is an easier explanation: neves only has months left on his deal and wolves may want to cash in now. neves is a sensational midfielder but wolves would potentially be risking their premier league status, though perhaps they feel julen lopetegui's system can thrive without neves. it's a no-brainer for the reds, even in klopp's money-complaint world (see update above this one). (nm) brighton and hove albion's strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the premier league, but the latter adjective makes roberto de zerbi's club vulnerable to big-money suitors. liverpool's said to want the ever-energetic -year-old ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by fabinho, jordan henderson, and thiago alcantara. caicedo learning from fabinho could be a match made in anfield heaven for jurgen klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from jordan henderson. the pay packet rise and champions league opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for caicedo, and this one could cost $- million less than enzo fernandez. (nm) it's official: cody gakpo is part of the anfield set. liverpool announced gakpo's arrival on wednesday with an interview on its web site, and manager jurgen klopp issued glowing praise for the dutch forward. ""there is a lot to like about cody. he is still only years old but he already has a lot of experience. he was the captain of psv, he was the player of the year in holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great world cup with his national team. so, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him."" there could hardly be a better time for this move whether you're discussing in terms of the club or the player. injuries to luis diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and gakpo certainly showed at the world cup that he's on his game. might this be the difference for the reds as they charge onward in both the premier league's top four race and the uefa champions league? more at liverpoolfc.com. (nm) what did @virgilvdijk tell cody gakpo about the club before the move? :thinking_face: his current club, psv eindhoven, have confirmed an agreement has been reached and gakpo is heading to liverpool for a medical. psv and @lfc have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of cody gakpo. the -year-old attacker will leave for england imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. where would gakpo slot in at liverpool? with liverpool already having mohamed salah, darwin nunez, diogo jota and roberto firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. gakpo, nunez and diaz will be liverpool's front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. this is a surprising move by liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score plus goals a season in the premier league. just like they did with luis diaz, liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (jpw) ""it's obviously a special moment for me and my family. another one that you dream of as a kid, and one i don't take for granted. ""it is an unbelievable place to be. in my eyes, probably one of the best -- if not the best -- clubs in the world at the minute. the opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. ""obviously, i have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things i still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. i have got more to learn and the time to do that. ""i think i have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. i think as a group, the sky is the limit. we want to go one, if not two, better than last season and aim for it all."" so, updating the note below... read more here the incredible journey continues :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:#salahstays liverpool are reportedly open to selling mohamed salah this summer as the egyptian star has just one year left on his current contract. the reds have been locked in talks with salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the the sun, liverpool could sell salah this summer for $ million. per the report, real madrid are the club salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on kylian mbappe and erling haaland this summer. should liverpool cash-in on salah just like they did with sadio mane earlier this week? with one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and salah has won everything he can at liverpool. with darwin nunez and luis diaz arriving over the last six months at anfield, it feels like liverpool have already made the moves to replace mane and salah long-term. now it's all about whether they sell salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. the latter option would not be good for liverpool from a business sense, especially as they've been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years. (jpw) bayern munich is claiming sadio mane as a coup for its club and league after the bundesliga champions unveiled the -year-old on wednesday. here's bayern board member hasan salihamidzic: ""in sadio mane a top international star is coming to fc bayern, who has left his mark on world football. we're proud to have brought him to munich. sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for fc bayern. everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. he will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. the fact that he's joining fc bayern shows that our club and he have big aims. sadio mane fits perfectly with the football that fc bayern play under julian nagelsmann."" (nm) ""there's obviously a pathway here - that's one of the reasons i chose it as well. it's not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,"" ramsay said. ""so if i can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there's no reason why i can't push to get in the first-team squad."" ramsay is a red :raising_hands::red_circle: liverpool is awaiting a fresh bid from bayern munich for star winger sadio mane, as reports claim the senegalese has agreed to terms with germany's serial champions. mane, , has been linked to bayern for some time and fabrizio romano says that it'll be a three-year contract for the forward. liverpool manager jurgen klopp is excited by the potential of his latest massive purchase, especially because possible nine-figure striker darwin nunez is already very, very good. ""darwin is a wonderful player; already really good but so much potential to get even better,"" klopp said.

" liverpool transfer news, live! latest reports, rumors, updates welcome, maximo! :blue_heart:#mancity more premier league leicester out of bottom three after - draw with everton brighton unload six goals on woeful wolves manchester city cruise past arsenal to take control of title race kalvin phillips - leeds united ($. million) julian alvarez - river plate ($ million) sergio gomez - anderlecht ($ million) stefan ortega-moreno - arminia bielefeld (free agent) maximo perrone - velez sarsfield ($ million)outraheem sterling - chelsea ($. million) gabriel jesus - arsenal ($. million) oleksandr zinchenko - arsenal ($. million) gavin bazunu - southampton ($. million) romeo lavia - southampton ($. million, plus $. million possible add-ons) fernandinho (end of contract) taylor harwood-bellis - burnley (loan) cj egan-riley - burnley (free agent) manchester city archived transfer news, summer ""it was a pride working with him from the first day. i used to watch manchester city when i was younger and he was the captain of the team. he was a role model for everybody. to me, it was an honour working with him and i'm very grateful to him for everything that happened last season at anderlecht. ""i spoke to him a few days ago. i told him about an option to move to manchester city and he told me he was very happy for me. he said he was proud of me for this big step in my career."" gomez, , will be with the first team, though it will likely take some time for pep guardiola to bed in the spaniard. (nm) following weeks of reports and speculation, and even confirmation from his former manager, oleksandr zinchenko is officially an arsenal player. the gunners announced the -year-old left back/midfielder's arrival on friday, with the ukrainian international calling it ""a boyhood dream come true."" (ae) england international midfielder kalvin phillips has switched his boyhood club leeds for manchester city, as the move costs an initial $. million. phillips is the long-term replacement for fernandinho and will add steel, creativity and class to city's engine room. this seems like a very good fit for pep guardiola and the transfer fee is pretty decent too. perhaps that was impacted by phillips having a rough - season as he spent most of it out injured. regardless of those struggles, the yorkshire pirlo has an incredible range of passing and he should slot in very nicely alongside rodri to give city's stable of wonderful attacking players plenty of license to roam free. phillips, , is joining city in his prime and guardiola will no doubt take his game to the next level. this is a very good deal for city and phillips. (jpw) usmnt goalkeeper zack steffen was expected to leave manchester city on loan this season should the citizens find a home for him. the out-of-contract -year-old starred for arminia bielefeld in the bundesliga but saw the club relegated as he finished out his contract. (nm) it comes as little to surprise to hear that new burnley manager vincent kompany would look to man city in a bid to boost the clarets back to the premier league. city will send highly-rated center back taylor harwood-bellis, , on a season-long loan to turf moor, while cj egan-riley moves to the clarets on a permanent deal. england u- back harwood-bellis started double-digit games for kompany's anderlecht last season and then went to stoke city, where ran up almost , minutes in the championship over a half-season. he's played eight times for city, scoring a goal against port vale in the fa cup. egan-riley, , is also an england youth international and made three senior appearances for man city last season. deal depends on zack steffen to find a good solution on the market, but ortega's waiting for city. fernandinho, oleksandr zinchenko and joao cancelo are out the door, while erling haaland, julian alvarez, and maximo perrone have arrived at the etihad stadium since the summer. will the new pieces help man city keep hold of the premier league and chase down the final jewel in its infinity gauntlet, the champions league title? and who will city chase in the future as a few positions look in need of a refresh under pep guardiola? below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on manchester city transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. it also reports that bellingham could be in advance talks with other clubs as well, so there's a grain of salt in this one, but we're going to share the buzz any time a possible $m+ player could be on the verge of a move. bellingham rates high in pretty much all metrics. the attack agile midfielder in an elite class at his position for interceptions and blocks, and is a willing and tremendous ball carrier. (nm) bayer leverkusen phenom florian wirtz is wanted by any of number of teams now that he's healed from a serious knee injury. man city's in the fight for wirtz's services, according to min, where it will jostle with barcelona, liverpool, real madrid, arsenal, tottenham, newcastle, bayern munich, and borussia dortmund amongst others. wirtz, , has a contract with leverkusen through the - season and his fee will be astronomical should he continue to show his injury hasn't changed much about him. it takes very little time watching newcastle united to see that bruno guimaraes is the straw that stirs the midfield drink for eddie howe. and it isn't often that pep guardiola is linked with a big-money buy these days that doesn't at least have a strong helping of truth in it. bruno running man city's midfield just kinda makes sense, as much as it might drive newcastle insane to consider guimaraes lining up with kevin de bruyne, rodri, phil foden and company. a report says guimaraes would be a target and guardiola could overhaul city by selling aymeric laporte and bernardo silva in addition to letting ilkay gundogan walk. silva and gundogan have been linked with barcelona, while lavia's future -- as detailed below -- is still in city's hands. is there smoke here? it certainly sounds logical enough, especially if newcastle doesn't land a place in the champions league. but newcastle's rise has been special for the players in the fold, and guimaraes may love the idea of continuing down the road of becoming a club legend. (nm) romeo lavia has impressed in a massive way since leaving manchester city for southampton last summer, reportedly sending tongues wagging at arsenal, chelsea, and manchester united. but hold on, folks: man city inserted a buyback clause in this summer's sale and may leap to the front of the queue after lavia's strong showings for saints. that said, this all probably hinges on whether southampton stays up, because lavia is still growing as a player and the pl minutes at st. mary's have done him well. chelsea wrecking ball mateo kovacic will enter the final months of his contract this summer, and multiple reports say city wants to bring the croatian midfielder aboard. the former dinamo zagreb, inter milan, and real madrid player has caps for croatia and is an elite ball mover in the midfield. his expected assists and shot-creating actions are also impressive, and you can imagine his actual assists would be higher on a normal year of finishing for chelsea. this makes sense for man city, but what about chelsea? normally you wouldn't see the blues selling anyone to a rival, especially one set for centurion status at croatia and still in his prime, but given the money chelsea's spent under new boss todd boehly... maybe this helps balance the books a bit. but selling jorginho and kovacic in the same six-month span? wild. (nm) could fulham's antonee robinson be on the move to a european club even if fulham do not quality for the europa league? football insider says newcastle united, manchester city, and ac milan are clubs who very much like the self-glossed ""jedi,"" who has thrived for club and country this year. would he leap at the chance to go to europe despite a great relationship with club captain and fellow usmnt back tim ream? robinson is about to hit his prime if he isn't in it already, and the everton alum might have eyes for the opportunity (nm). ins maximo perrone - velez sarsfield ($ million) outs joao cancelo - bayern munich (loan with $ million buy option) what a wild move, as pep guardiola sanctions the loan of joao cancelo to bayern munich with the option to buy in the summer. joao cancelo has only fallen out of favor with pep guardiola in recent weeks, but the portuguese left back is set to depart manchester city for bayern munich. cancelo's move to the -time bundesliga champions will be a loan initially, with a $-million option to buy in the summer. (ae) man city transfer rumors have had a ""where there's smoke, there's fire"" feel over the past few windows, so it's no surprise to see maximo perrone quickly going from reported target to man city player. we reported last week that his reported release clause would be triggered by man city but there was some question whether velez sarsfield would find a way to stand in the way of his move. perrone is a fine reader of the game who is also not afraid of a tackle. an excellent dribbler and play driver, perrone should learn plenty from both rodri and kevin de bruyne (amongst others). (nm) welcome, maximo! :blue_heart:#mancity velez boss sergio rapisarda is less than pleased with city, however. what will he do if perrone's reported meager $ million release clause is triggered by city? ""the boy, he wants to go,"" rapisarda said. ""the city coach called him three times. mascherano also persuaded him, which i don't like. the boy loves the coach of that club. we are going to take the risk. we are trying to be the best in the transfer and with numbers that favour velez. perrone, who just celebrated his birthday earlier this month, has also been linked with newcastle united amongst several other sides, but the center midfielder and argentina u- debutant fits well with guardiola. (nm) in erling haaland - borussia dortmund ($ million) - more kalvin phillips - leeds united ($. million) julian alvarez - river plate ($ million) sergio gomez - anderlecht ($ million) stefan ortega-moreno - arminia bielefeld (free agent) maximo perrone - velez sarsfield ($ million) out raheem sterling - chelsea ($. million) gabriel jesus - arsenal ($. million) oleksandr zinchenko - arsenal ($. million) gavin bazunu - southampton ($. million) romeo lavia - southampton ($. million, plus $. million possible add-ons) fernandinho (end of contract) taylor harwood-bellis - burnley (loan) cj egan-riley - burnley (free agent) the left back below is going to city, as man city announced the capture of anderlecht's sergio gomez on a four-year deal. as expected, the vincent kompany connection was huge to the deal. ""it was a pride working with him from the first day. i used to watch manchester city when i was younger and he was the captain of the team. he was a role model for everybody. to me, it was an honour working with him and i'm very grateful to him for everything that happened last season at anderlecht. ""i spoke to him a few days ago. i told him about an option to move to manchester city and he told me he was very happy for me. he said he was proud of me for this big step in my career."" gomez, , will be with the first team, though it will likely take some time for pep guardiola to bed in the spaniard.

(ae) england international midfielder kalvin phillips has switched his boyhood club leeds for manchester city, as the move costs an initial $. million. phillips is the long-term replacement for fernandinho and will add steel, creativity and class to city's engine room. this seems like a very good fit for pep guardiola and the transfer fee is pretty decent too. perhaps that was impacted by phillips having a rough - season as he spent most of it out injured. regardless of those struggles, the yorkshire pirlo has an incredible range of passing and he should slot in very nicely alongside rodri to give city's stable of wonderful attacking players plenty of license to roam free. phillips, , is joining city in his prime and guardiola will no doubt take his game to the next level. this is a very good deal for city and phillips. (jpw) usmnt goalkeeper zack steffen was expected to leave manchester city on loan this season should the citizens find a home for him. the out-of-contract -year-old starred for arminia bielefeld in the bundesliga but saw the club relegated as he finished out his contract. (nm) it comes as little to surprise to hear that new burnley manager vincent kompany would look to man city in a bid to boost the clarets back to the premier league. city will send highly-rated center back taylor harwood-bellis, , on a season-long loan to turf moor, while cj egan-riley moves to the clarets on a permanent deal. england u- back harwood-bellis started double-digit games for kompany's anderlecht last season and then went to stoke city, where ran up almost , minutes in the championship over a half-season. he's played eight times for city, scoring a goal against port vale in the fa cup. egan-riley, , is also an england youth international and made three senior appearances for man city last season. german goalkeeper stefan ortega could become manchester city's no. goalkeeper if zack steffen finds a transfer destination to his liking, according to sky sports. ortega, , has spent much of his career with arminia bielefeld, which was relegated to .bundesliga this season. steffen, meanwhile, may want to pursue a no. shirt this summer as ederson is not likely to lose his at man city any time soon and the usmnt backstop is locked in a battle with matt turner to start at the world cup. the -year-old american cost city around $- million in when he made his second trip abroad. he was previously on the books at freiburg and columbus crew, and starred on loan to fortuna dusseldorf from city in the - season (though fortuna was relegated). deal depends on zack steffen to find a good solution on the market, but ortega's waiting for city. follow @nicholasmendola latest premier league news premier league table, -

"monday morning headlines to start your week. if you buy something from an sb nation link, vox media may earn a commission. see our ethics statement. what a win for manchester city women over chelsea fc. the ladies are now second in the fa wsl table. the men are returning to manchester to begin prepping for a weekend visit from liverpool. sky blue news is here to get you ready for the week ahead. manchester city moved up to second in the barclays women's super league table with a hard-fought - win over reigning champions chelsea. a spectacular strike from fillipa angeldahl set the tone for a convincing first half display, with the swede lobbing ann-katrin berger from just inside the area. lauren hemp doubled the advantage soon after with a stinging drive into the top corner to send the majority of the ,-strong academy stadium crowd into raptures. and while city were unable to add to the advantage in an evenly contested second , victory extended our unbeaten wsl run to matches as our title bid gathers momentum. although the blues were excellent in the first half, city didn't have everything their own way and it was the visitors who had the better of the opening exchanges. ellie roebuck, back in wsl action after missing the match at brighton two weeks ago, was called into action to prevent sam kerr from beating her at the near post, and later prevented sophie ingle's deflected effort from finding the back of the goal. they would be the best chances chelsea had as city took a grip on the game and forced the visitors back into their own half. the blues were finding space inside the chelsea area but couldn't take advantage, and it would take something special to break the deadlock. and angeldahl duly obliged. chelsea were hesitant in defence and a ball out from the back was cut out by the swede. chloe kelly, who tormented the chelsea left side throughout the first half, charged forward before finding angeldahl in space on the edge of the penalty area. taking a touch, the swede floated a magnificent strike beyond the keeper and into the top corner to give city the lead. city were swarming all over the champions and when hemp made it - on minutes, the fans were wondering just how many city could get. kelly's cross into the box wasn't dealt with and coombs had time to knock the ball down and find hemp completely unmarked. the england winger wasted no time and arrowed a first-time strike into the corner of the goal to leave chelsea shell-shocked. the premier league and manchester city's title chase resumes next weekned with a crunch home game against liverpool. city currently sit points behind arsenal, having played a game less. a loss or a draw against liverpool, whilst not a death blow to city's title pursuit, you do feel the mountain becomes almost insurmountable. arsenal do have some tough fixtures coming up, but for me a win over liverpool is a must. we know liverpool will be up for the game at the etihad, they always are against city. with their top chances slipping away with every inconsistent performance of theirs, you do feel they'll be up for the clash as per usual. i'm expecting a exciting game, on a par with the usual city/liverpool clashes of seasons past. foden was a substitute in england's win at italy on thursday, before being taken off shortly after following luke shaw's red card. he would have hoped to have featured in the home fixture with ukraine on sunday, but city have confirmed that the winger has withdrawn from international duty. england confirmed foden had surgery on sunday to remove his appendix, while city said in a statement, that foden will now return to manchester for recovery. he is definitely out of the liverpool clash next weekend, and the club have not given a timeframe on how long he will be out for. ""manchester city can confirm phil foden has left the england squad after undergoing surgery in london for acute appendicitis,"" the statement read. ""phil will now return to manchester to begin rehabilitation. he will not be fit for this weekend's premier league game at home to liverpool and it is unclear at this stage how long he will be unavailable for. man city confirm phil foden has undergone surgery #mcfc while adedire mebude is yet to register a single senior appearance for pep guardiola's first-team squad, his performances in the premier league , uefa youth league, and efl trophy so far this season have earned him a promotion in scotland's international youth set-up. mebude was selected for scotland's under-s this week for their round of international fixtures, making his debut for the age group on thursday night against sweden's under-s in a friendly match at the pinatar arena in murcia, spain. just nine minutes into that debut, and mebude marked the occasion with a sublime solo goal, receiving the ball from manchester city's on-loan midfielder lewis fiorini, before weaving between defenders and smashing a low, driven effort past goalkeeper noel tornqvist. ""i really liked raheem sterling. he was my man. i wanted to learn from him, leroy sane and riyad mahrez,"" explained mebude. ""i've trained with the first team a few times. they are out of this world. it's surreal training with them and it's great to be involved. john stones and kyle walker played the full minutes as england claimed a comfortable - win over ukraine at wembley. goals from harry kane and bukayo saka mean gareth southgate's side have two wins from two at the start of qualifying for euro following the - defeat of italy on thursday. jack grealish was a late substitute at wembley while kalvin phillips stayed on the bench after playing an integral role in naples. phil foden was unavailable after having surgery for acute appendicitis. ukraine gave as good as they got in the opening half hour with stones and walker part of the defence on hand to deny chelsea winger mykhaylo mudryk, marseille man ruslan malinovsky and club brugge forward roman yaremchuk. stones and @kylewalker star as england cruise past ukraine! tap to read and finally... it's awesome to meet an absolute sporting legend. we're sure usain bolt was thrilled. man city defender esme morgan told goal of hemp's excitement after meeting bolt: ""i've heard usain bolt just asked for her shirt so she must have impressed! i don't know when he did but she just came to me. she was like, 'es guess who's just asked for my shirt?' ""i was racking my head through the chelsea team thinking, 'who's she had a battle with today? they might have wanted it after.' i was too tired to think of anyone and she was just like, 'usain bolt!' i couldn't believe it. it must be the pace."" asked who is faster between hemp and bolt, morgan replied: ""lauren."" there you have it. be sure to stay with bitter and blue for all the latest. have a great monday and check back tomorrow for more from sky blue news. gambling problem? call () - or visit gamblinghelpline.ma.org (ma), call --hopeny/text hopeny () (ny), odds and lines subject to change. + (+ nh/wy). physically present in az/co/ct/il/in/ia/ks/la (select parishes)/ma/md/mi/nh/nj/ny/oh/or/pa/tn/va/wv/wy only. void in ont. eligibility restrictions apply. see terms at draftkings.com/sportsbook. on behalf of boot hill casino & resort (ks).""}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-03-27T10:30:00Z

"aston villa continue their impressive form to mastermind another away victory to increase pressure on the chelsea manager graham potter tried a new look on the touchline, but this was the same old chelsea under the beleaguered head coach who saw the pressure piled back on his position by aston villa. dressed in skinny black jeans and a hoodie for the first time, potter saw everything he tried go wrong as ollie watkins became the first villa player to score in five successive away games and john mcginn net for the first time in club games. he will not have been surprised to hear the jeers and shouts for him to go at the final whistle, given potter has already been through it once before in his short chelsea reign. it will not have helped the mood of the chelsea fans to have learned that the club's former head coach thomas tuchel won his first game in charge of bayern munich, - against borussia dortmund. having gone into the international break on the back of four games unbeaten, potter finds his chelsea team back to square one, in the bottom half of the table and fans yet again questioning his suitability for the job.

""with mason, i just felt we were there in the game. we had made some attacking subs and we wanted to see how it all landed. mason's coming back, he's only had a couple of days training."" villa's victory meant they leapfrogged chelsea, who now prepare for the visit of liverpool on tuesday night in the bottom half of the table with pressure back on potter's shoulders. potter will know that chelsea are yet to beat a side in the top half of the table and seven of their final games of the season are against teams above them, which suggests things could even get worse before they get better.

"untold arsenal: supporting the club, the manager and the team ""i believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art."" a wenger how chelsea got mudryk wrong by bulldog drummond and yet they didn't. of course we won't know for sure, but if arsenal seriously were in for mudryk, that would have been the first major mistake of arteta's career - and the fact that he hasn't really made any blunders like that, makes me think arsenal were never interested, but were happy to see a cover for the real story - the transfer of trossard. i must say i'm very happy with the way leandro has settled in at the arsenal. i couldn't have hoped for a better start of his arsenal career. and here is something rather funny. when trossard was mentioned leaving belgium and was transferred to bha there also was a rumour that arsenal was having a close eye on him at the time. in flanders we then at the time had a bit of a moerman moment and didn't think it was a good idea from arsenal. but as things stand trossard has proven to be a great addition to the squad and has filled in perfectly. so the series on tv was fiction after all. but then again... a young brazilian making the headlines.... not completely fiction.... great story! as fun of a read as this was, i must say that it's all that it was - a fun read. i'm fairly certain that the interest in mudryk was very real - but i strongly suspect that once chelsea started sniffing around and the price started increasing, our interest in being milked for more cash began decreasing and the decision was made to string chelsea along and get them bidding against themselves, while we looked at alternatives (much as was done to us with pepe - and i'm glad we learned from it). if he ever figures out the mental part of the game, mudryk will be a very good player - but i'm not sure that he'll manage it at chelsea with the weight of those expectations. even if he does, trossard was still the right buy for us given our needs at this time. thanks walter, always great to hear from you. well, now we can read on the deadwood 'so-called newspages' that arsenal are prepared to swap cash zinchenko and tierney for hernandes from ac milan. i mean...yeah....replacing a vital cogpiece, as well as the second player on the left side...by an unknown to arsenal...such a crap. as much as i take all the transfer rumours with a pinch of salt i do believe we were in for mudryk. the thing is we have a budget. chelsea do not. both them factors effectively mean that the moment chelsea, or any club without a budget for that matter, enter the fray, we have no chance of landing our target. i don't think mudryk had any say in his destination. i still believe, although it is merely speculation on my part, that his preferred destination was arsenal. as to whether we have 'dodged a bullet', only time will tell? similarly, would this of been arteta's/edu's first real error in the transfer market? again, only time will tell. regarding both of those possibilities, personally i prefer to reserve judgement on him. after all he has joined a very dysfunctional team under a manager that seemed incapable of utilizing the enormous resources at his disposal. in and out of the team. a complete lack of a coherent strategy. playing alongside players that seemed to lack any confidence at all. who knows how he would have performed in a properly functioning chelsea team, or indeed arsenal team? maybe, once a new manager is installed at stamford bridge the real mudryk will emerge? maybe we have already seen the real mudryk and he's not that great? as i said, only time will tell. as for trossard. well, given how astute edu and arteta have be in the transfer market i have every faith in the fact that he was a clear and worthy plan b. the fact he has worked out so well, so quickly, has i believe even shocked them. but that's what can happen when you fit the perfect cog into an already well oiled, perfectly functioning machine. but, of course it could all of been an audacious plan, involving duplicity and mis direction? who knows. personally i just think it was a masterstroke having trossard as a plan b. we don't know how mudryk would have evolved under the guidance of arteta.... but for m one can expect a bit of a finished product.... it was also interesting that some arsenal players followed mudryk's including zinchenko's wife, instagram account. in the recent ukraine match. zinchenko mentioned along the lines of he made his mind up to go to chelsea so have to put up with it. chris ""why even arsenal fans must be wishing they had daniel levy at their club after this transfer window. our man in madrid darren lewis reckons the tottenham chairman has played a blinder this summer"" ""the mirror sports writer believes the now-traditional mockery of the tottenham chairman's approach ignores just what a stellar acquisition he has managed to land his club. yes, he may be a pantomime transfer villain but you have to give daniel levy credit. the spurs chairman has left the club in terrific shape ahead of their first champions league campaign under mauricio pochettino."" ""tottenham hotspur's season looked to be on track for a nightmare campaign, but chairman levy has worked his magic to get spurs off to a promising start and keep hold of star striker harry kane"" this is what darren lewis said about arsenal back in : ""arsenal fans won't admit it but even they must secretly wish they had a custodian with his (daniel levy) ruthless streak and his skill at protecting the interests of his club. even they must secretly wish they had someone at the emirates to impress upon arsene wenger that, with the game having changed during his time at the club, you really do get what you pay for."" arsenal /: th fa cup /: rd fa cup community shield /: nd community shield /: th fa cup /: th community shield /: th /: th fa cup /: th community shield /: th so that's fa cups and community shields, you know, just for a bit of fun. spurs /: th /: th /: rd /: nd /: rd /: th /: th /: th /: th now the first thing you may notice is that the trophy column for spurs is, well, a bit spartan. but still over the years they did manage the th is not a trophy position times, which is more than we managed, so credit where credit is due. even then their average finish over the years has been . where as ours has been .. about half a place, and we've been rubbish by all accounts, whilst spurs have been exceling!! but you do have to wonder what it was about levy that mr lewis found so bedazzling? after all this is what he had to say just recently: journalist darren lewis of the daily mirror, writing on social media, claims kane will 'try again' to leave spurs this year amid what can only be described as a real mess. ""conte is challenging spurs to be better - as redknapp, pochettino & mourinho did before they went. he's reached the conclusion carrick, berbatov, modric & bale etc did before they left. kane too - he tried to go two years ago. he'll try again this summer."" so what conclusion is that lewis is drawing? according to lewis, levy has been doing a fine job since as far back as . back then apparently arsenal could of learned a thing or two from levy's 'genius' dealings in the transfer market, as well as making us fans as jealous as hell! but now apparently lewis suggests that managers and players alike from as far back as have been leaving in droves on the basis the club is simply incapable of 'challenging'!! so either levy is a 'genius' or he's not. what is it i wonder? depends what way the wind blows i suppose, aye mr lewis? you do have to wonder how on earth he keeps his job. assistant editor no less. i know if i was that crap at mine i'd of been out long ago. @nitram, yeah....deadwood scribler or deadwood pr loudspeaker enthralled by the 'genius' of mr levy. now about mudryk...i don't believe anyone held a gun to his head for a year contract...so...he's rich, has got a safe job and is out of the war zone. so i don't see any need to feel sorry for him. and i mean, hiring a sports director or whatever his title was who was entangled in a scandal and on the way to be potentially banned.... i don't think i can call this 'sound business acumen' and absolutely not 'genius'. to me, levy. boehly, same matrix. as i've posted before, the spurs backoffice is an abyssmal pit of incompetence. @nitram, and just to put things into perspective... it ain't like spurs are the worst managed team in the world...far from it. just look at psg. - more the millions in losses, - average monthly player salary above million euros (k a week as average salary...) - just lost this week-end to lyon and are not sure to clinch the ligue trophy - no relevant success in the cl since...ever....except being the receiving team of a few remontadas. and chelsea are kind of starting to head the same way. money, too much of it, is no guarantee for success. which brings me to the team i kind of like in the pl (i love arsenal...not the same thing) : brighton. what they are succeeding at is quite a feat. and by the way, the toffees are playing better then spurs after minutes. let's hope they win it. yep, actually not a bad game. dyche has done with everton what he does. made them hard working and hard to play against. quality lacking hence the inconsistency. i'm predicting a - draw. my issue with spurs is not really spurs, or levy, it's the fawning media. that lewis has endlessly sung the praises of levy whilst endlessly criticising arsenal and their custodians, yet we are by far the better run club, and the more successful. i have said a few times, that given their nett spend, which is relatively low, at least in pl terms, they have done well. top finishes. pl r/u cl r/u. but we have done better. spurs just cannot win anything, and that is a massive flaw in the character of the club. even when we are not doing so well we still win things. yet the media endlessly deride us, and praise spurs. yes they are taking a bit of stick at the moment but if they put wins in a row together they will be the mighty spurs again. if we have defeats we'll be calamity gunners again. as i say, it's not really spurs or their fans that get my goat, rather the fawning media. kane kicks people pulls the guys shirt then dives like a big girl. what a cheat. ""okay he went down theatrically but that's okay"" that's what he said. as i say, media just love spurs. that was just embarrasing by kane. he was swinging his arms just like the everton player and was hit lightly on his face. goinggoinggooner anyway, all's well that ends well. spurs just show again why 'spursy' has ended up in the dictionary. spurs are the gift that just keeps on giving. well, say what you want, it must be the dna of the club or the air in that part of town. spurs are thugs and cheats, whichever manager they have. what kane did, from behind on a player he pushed on the ground is just mean and cowardly. and moura did was just so dangerous. anyway, there was some justice, iwobi should get some congrats from arsenal and except for our game against them, i am going to be a fan of brighton until the end of the season. i have a bottle of bubbly all ready to go. this season, ben white has scored more goals in the pl than richarlison. darren lewis is of the opinion that potter should have been sacked. he talks about potter's poor form. nothing to do with the players then. he describes potter as a rookie, when potter has a history of success at his previous teams. the only rookies i can see are boehly/eghballi who appear to have no previous experience running a football club. lewis appears to be a ""reactionary journalist"", only able to see events in a short-term context, missing the bigger picture entirely. read some of his other articles, and you'll quickly see a pattern emerge wherein he is unable to ""join dots"", much less identify cause and effect. piers morgan's spiritual heir. to be truthful , i never ever heard of mudryk , and still don't know which club he came from ! when all this was going on , i was thinking of smoke being blown up someone's arse . when chelsea bought him , my chelski loving son , was gloating . well we now know how that went down ! i think that even he did not know of said player till all the fuss was made . the lesser said about their last two managers and that alleged prolific striker they bought from barca , the better . that he may have seen more managers than years supporting his club , is lost on him. nor the millions wasted by the club ! just so you can see it by yourselves...perfect picture... @seismic, i would not call this lewis guy a 'journalist'. a weather vane could be better. by going after potter he just is licking chelsea owners' boots and doing their dirty work. a journalist presents facts. not a mention of the fact chelsea had players... that potter had most probably no say at all on who comes and who goes. chelsea reportedly paid around million euros for a year old kid from ecuador. seriously ?!?! we are seeing casino players at work here. then again, throwing money around is not illegal. seismic, chris et el ""lewis appears to be a ""reactionary journalist"", only able to see events in a short-term context, missing the bigger picture entirely"" when we infamously lost those opening matches it wasn't just the 'deadwood' journalists calling for artetas head, but a vast number of arsenal fans as well. untold has watched and analysed artetas and the teams progress in minute detail across seasons. from: -getting the defence sorted. -employing the low tackle approach. -developing the young guns. -implementing an impeccable scouting and buying policy. -re engaging with the fans and turning the emirates into a high octane theatre of love. -employing an attacking style so flexible an unpredictable it's almost impossible to plan against. it has to be said that none of this could of happened without the full backing and support of our owner and ceo. they stuck by arteta when those deadwoods were screaming for his head. when many of our fans were calling for change. they not only stuck by him but they have backed him to the tune of PS million.(PSm per season) that compares to wenger's relatively 'high' spending last years of a mere PS million. (PS m per season) so they have well and truly put their money where their mouth is. untold has noted and talked about all these strings being pulled together. whether we win the premier league or not, what has happened over the last years has been remarkable. it hasn't been cheap, and artetas predecessors relative short comings must be put into perspective with regards to this, but it has worked. 'bigger picture' 'long term' 'joining dots' don't make me laugh. these concepts are so alien to a football hack that if you even attempted to explain any of them they would turn to the wall and start quivering like a jellyfish on a spin dryer!! the kind of in depth research and data analysis carried out by untold, as well as many of us contributors, is of no interest to these goldfish brained morons. @martin, the owners of arsenal have a multi-million dollar business based on running (not buying and then selling for more) sports clubs. they don't bet on this player or that result. they look for long term financial results, hopefully positive. they have other businesses as well. they've been doing it for a long time. in this regards they are different then most if not all the other owners in the pl. and this is something the deadwood outsourced pr scribblers have still not yet understood. but then, when all you do is repeat and move in circles like a weather vane. chris @martin? seems i've been rumbled. @nitram, don't know what happened ther....was talking irl with a friend called martin while writing. ;=)) cheers ! curiouser and curiouser. d \t\t\t\t\ttheme by seos themes'}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-04-03T13:14:00Z

"here's a funny stat shared over the weekend. erik ten hag is the premier league's ninth-longest serving manager. he's been on the job eight months. the intense pressure of the true super league, which is what the premier league is, claimed two more victims yesterday when chelsea put graham potter in a box marked, ""to timbuktu,"" and then leicester city agreed to part ways with brendan rodgers, i.e. told him to go kick rocks and he agreed he should depart for some rock-booting. caffeinate yourselfa whole array of breville espresso machines--from manual to super-automatic--are on sale for % off. chelsea don't have a spine both physically and spiritually, which is where the blame for potter comes in. they have looked utterly toothless for most of his run, and as soon as they went down - to villa they never really looked like they would claw back anything. there are some interesting patterns they weave in the build-up with the ball, but once they hit the final third it's like everyone's controller gets shut off. which was the story for potter's brighton teams, that they would play some really beautiful stuff but couldn't make it count nearly enough. a problem that roberto de zerbi seems to have solved in potter's wake. it's hard to say chelsea don't have too much left on the table, given that they're in the quarterfinals of the champions league and have a date with real madrid. while running through madrid and then the winner of man city-munich to even get to the final is about as tough of a draw as any team could ask for, it's not like it's impossible. that gets harder with either an interim manager in place or a permanent one who's been in the job a few days. the league season is shot. they're currently in th. but clearly, boehly and the rest of the execs need this incredibly expensive squad to be formed into something from jump street next season, otherwise, all that money spent might draw some interest from the financial fair play investigators. but does a prime managerial candidate like julian nagelsmann or luis enrique want to step into a club that is seemingly trying to run in five different directions at once? the cull of managers in the premier league is only a testament to the rewards at hand, no matter what level a club finds itself. for tottenham or chelsea, it's about trying to claw back the riches of the champions league. sort of the same for leicester, though now they're eying the trapdoor as if it contains the tell-tale heart. leicester is not a club that can pay premier league wages while in the championship. which is the story for all the other eight clubs in the relegation fight, which is why all of them have changed managers save west ham and nottingham forest (southampton has done so twice). and forest spent over $ million on new players this season. for instance, leicester earned nearly $ million in tv money last season from the league's various tv deals. right now, sky sports in england pays the efl, which runs the lower three divisions in england, $ million in total for the tv rights to all those leagues. you can see the problem. and that doesn't get into cheaper tickets and everything else that deflates upon relegation. the urgency is overwhelming. while most clubs will have some players on relegation clauses with a lowering of their salaries should the club go down, cutting the wage bill down by or even percent doesn't make up for the loss of the rest of the income that springs from premier league status. clubs simply don't feel like they have time for ""a project"" to come together without feeling like they'll get passed by another club operating like a vegas coke binge. patience may land you in hell. there are only four champions league spots for seven ""big"" clubs. well-run machines like brighton, brentford, and maybe aston villa now under unai emery are waiting to pounce on what's left. everyone else is spending to keep their heads above the relegation waters, and that includes the teams who get promoted. it's a sprint on the field and in boardrooms. give clubs a taste of the good land and they'll want more and more. they'll need it to survive. which will see managers run over like this become the norm. you either hit the highest gears immediately, or you won't get time to catch up. for more of sam's barely coherent footy thoughts, follow him on twitter @felsgate.'}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-04-03T18:44:00Z

" ""real madrid just had to be good enough against opponents resembling a sinking vessel peopled by castaways well, there goes the season. perhaps summer budget too. who knows maybe the entire chelsea . blue sky project stage one? with minutes to go in a champions league second leg chelsea always seemed to be losing, even when they were threatening vaguely to win it, the home bench took a deep breath, cleared its throat, and coughed up PSm of randomly assembled attacking talent. admittedly chelsea were - down in the tie by the time raheem sterling, joao felix and mykhaylo mudryk came on to the pitch, having spent an hour playing with five defenders and three defensive midfielders, one of them installed as an assiduous and energetic no -cum-right-winger. and yes, by that point this thrillingly overmanned attacking machine had mustered a single goal in its last minutes of football. but hey: boehly-ball. go with it. disrupt. subvert the dominant paradigm. storm the dressing room. anything to keep away the gathering sense of quiet horror around this whole grand, baffling, viciously wasteful football-style project. this was a strange football match. there is something sad, but also grotesque about seeing this chelsea team toiling through their patterns, all mangled shapes and blocked talent. nothing here feels permanent or stitched together, or put in place with any skill or love. we are the hollow men. we are the stuffed men. we are the human spoils of todd boehly's incoherent acquisitiveness, the top down confusion as to how this complex and heavily ritualised sport actually works. for all that chelsea did also play well here. stamford bridge was boisterously full, those low white midweek lights conjuring the muscle memory of more coherent times, of teams that looked like teams, of some guiding intelligence behind this -year project team. there were key missed chances before madrid took the lead. the ball kept falling to n'golo kante close to goal, but then this will happen if you select n'golo kante to play close to goal. frank lampard had picked a team to snipe and harry and chase, with conor gallagher and kante as his dogs of counter-pressing. and it worked for a bit. chelsea did snap and chase and force some hurried clearances, producing minutes of angry, chastened, slightly vague attacking pressure. things happened but didn't happen. chelsea almost made chances. reece james had an excellent game after the chasing in madrid. chelsea have many problems. james really isn't one of them. just before half-time marc cucurella allowed thibaut courtois to produce a world-class save, waiting just a little too long in front of goal. still, though it felt a little bit desperate measures, an attempt to throw a shape over something shapeless. by the end chelsea had launched crosses into the madrid box, which really is a lot of crosses. is this the right way to do this thing? maybe. who knows. what does todd think? madrid just had to be good enough here. they took the lead through rodrygo, set up by a lovely little pass from vinicius junior. rodrygo also walked the second goal into the net to make it - on aggregate. kepa arrizabalaga launched a wild, swinging leg as he lingered on the line. it felt a little insolent. but can you blame madrid for that? this wasn't so much men against boys as a highly competent team against a hallucinogenic fever dream of how to do soccer, winched into place by a coterie of hyped up management consultants. something a little grotesque has been created here, a real-time reminder of the things people want to do to this sport, of the distorting effects of money without sense or love or care. even the half-time warmup was an excruciating spectacle as chelsea's star substitutes bumbled about in their padded coats bantering with antonio rudiger, swaggering vaguely, conveying a sense of total alienation. there may have been more contemptuously disinterested knee lunges than those performed by hakim ziyech on the stamford bridge pitch. but not many. and none that spring to mind. kick off your evenings with the guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion and so chelsea's season has pretty much reached an end point. perhaps the promise of a europa conference league place might fire the synapses. more like this entity is heading for some more public contortions. the air is starting to hum a little. and pretty soon nobody around here will have much to lose. what happens to this club from here? there is no way of clawing back the stupid amounts of money spent. income will now take a dive. what do you do to recoup those investment funds? capsize the premier league and start a money harvesting super league? or cut your losses and move on to hydrogen batteries or olive oil or lithium mining? right now this place is starting to resemble a footballing version of the raft of the medusa, a sinking vessel peopled by castaways, hanging on not out of love or duty but self preservation. who is really looking out for this thing anyway, the delicate, patchwork entity that is chelsea fc. the club's third manager in the last eight months is basically a sole trader, expert, if nothing else in self-preservation. the players have their own brands and auras and future worth to protect. the season may be dead on its feet, a lesson in nothing more than how to turn human talent into cold product. but there is still a sense of unresolved energy about this toxic escapade. the next few weeks might just make for interesting viewing.""}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-04-18T22:38:33Z
" thiago silva hit out at the chelsea hierarchy following the team's lacklustre champions league exit at the hands of real madrid on tuesday night and blamed their 'indecision' for the west london side's disappointing season. the veteran defender - who won the champions league with chelsea under thomas tuchel in - cut a disappointed figure on the pitch after the final whistle as he was consoled by frank lampard. defeat at stamford bridge not only put chelsea out of contention for silverware this season, but all but sealed next season's fate in europe. currently languishing th in the premier league table and on their worst run of form since after four losses in all competitions, the blues are unlikely to qualify for european competitions as they sit points off sixth-placed aston villa. todd boehly and co-controlling owner behdad eghbali came under fire for a dressing-room speech given after the side's weekend loss against brighton during which they are said to have singled out a 'senior player' and left him disillusioned heading into tuesday's fixture, and called the team performance 'embarrassing'. thiago silva hit out at chelsea's owners, blaming their 'indecision' for a disappointing season behdad eghbali and todd boehly were in attendance and seen making their way to the dressing room after the club's defeat to real madrid speaking after the match, silva decried the 'incorrect step' the owners have taken and said that the team's downfall could not be placed on their managers - four in total as it stands - alone. 'i think the first step has been made. an incorrect step, but it has been made,' silva began. 'we can't be blaming the managers if we don't take responsibility. it's a hard period for the club, with a lot of indecision. 'change of ownership, new players arriving - we had to increase the size of the changing room because it didn't fit the size of the squad.' 'there is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play,' silva went on. 'the manager can only pick from a squad of -something - that's tough. despite the influx of players in west london, silva frequently makes the blues' starting xi new recruits joao felix, mykhaylo mudryk and raheem sterling were three of the boehly-era players to make an appearance at stamford bridge as the blues are said to be narrowing their focus to the appointment of julian nagelsmann as potter's long-term replacement, silva pointed out that a change in manager would not be a catch-all solution. 'everybody talks too much about replacing managers. i think we, as players, must also take responsibility,' he said. 'we have had three managers this season, plus a fourth with bruno where we failed to win. we have lost today and with lampard we have failed to win. 'everybody is talking about the manager but we must look at what has been done wrong and try to change.' he has a year left on his contract with chelsea and although the brazilian is a highly valued member of the starting xi, silva was realistic about his future long-term. tuesday night marked silva's th appearance in the champions league, and possibly, his last. 'it has been a very difficult season and a frustrating one for me personally,' silva said. 'it might have been my last match in the champions league. silva was disappointed to think that tuesday could have marked his last european outing but focus will shift to the league as frank lampard continues to hunt for his first win in charge 'i have only one year left on my contract and my career is reaching the end. it's a very sad day. 'but i think we must continue working to try to win as many matches until the end of the season.' due to rescheduling around manchester united's fa cup commitments, chelsea have a week to regroup before returning to stamford bridge for their league tie against brentford. lampard and his squad will seek the first win of his second stint in charge of the blues. share what you think",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-04-19T08:05:31Z
" ""chelsea have not placed luis enrique among the leading candidates for the permanent head coach job as the club start to cut down their shortlist and prepare for a new round of talks. enrique flew to london two weeks ago for discussions with chelsea but there are no further talks planned with the former barcelona man, which could leave the path clear for tottenham hotspur to make their move. chelsea are expected to hold further talks with nagelsmann, who was interviewed last week, and pochettino, along with other coaches, with club sources still insistent there is not yet a favourite or single leading contender for the post. nagelsmann is believed to have impressed chelsea during his interview but, despite outside sources and some players believing he is the most likely permanent successor to graham potter, insiders have rejected any notion that the german is emerging as the favourite yet. as disclosed by telegraph sport, tottenham have made moves to contact enrique and it appears the north london club might have a clear run at him with chelsea's attention focused more vividly elsewhere. chairman daniel levy has previously expressed reservations over enrique's lack of premier league experience, but the spaniard has been highly recommended to spurs and is on the club's shortlist of candidates to permanently succeed antonio conte. despite their elimination from the champions league, the chelsea job is still rated as one of the most attractive in europe, but boehly and eghbali know they cannot afford to get their next appointment wrong. boehly and eghbali have already sacked thomas tuchel and potter, and put frank lampard in caretaker charge until the end of the season, inside months. but, following the champions league defeat by real madrid, defender thiago silva warned: ""everybody talks too much about replacing managers. i think we, as players, must also take responsibility. ""we have had three managers this season, plus a fourth with bruno where we failed to win. we have lost today and with lampard, we have failed to win. everybody is talking about the manager but we must look at what has been done wrong and try to change.

""change of ownership, new players arriving - we had to increase the size of the changing room because it didn't fit the size of the squad. ""a positive point is that there are amazing players in the squad, but on the other hand there are always players that are going to be unhappy. there is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play. the manager can only pick from a squad of -something - that's tough. chelsea's champions league exit has left some players facing the prospect of pay cuts of up to per cent, while others will not see their wages immediately hit by a failure to qualify for the competition should they stay at the club. the boehly-clearlake capital owners introduced a bonus system after buying chelsea from roman abramovich, who only paid bonuses for winning trophies and did not include champions league reduction clauses in contracts. having spent PS million in the past two transfer windows, the move to insert champions league clauses will help offset some of the costs of not playing in europe's top competition, although some of the cuts may be deferred past next season. big earners from the abramovich era include kepa arrizabalaga, kai havertz, mateo kovacic, hakim ziyech, christian pulisic and n'golo kante, who has been in negotiations over an extension to his contract past the end of this season. two weeks removed from spraining his right knee, sixers star joel embiid scored just points in a series-tying - loss to the celtics in game of the eastern conference semifinals. bosa will play for his third different defensive coordinator in five years with the ers. he's not worried about it affecting his game. ""obviously, it's not the team that we've put together,"" cashman said of the yankees' rough start to . ""we've had a lot of injuries."" the world's top athlete earners collectively cracked $. billion in the last year. rory mcilroy is back on tour this week for the first time since he missed the cut at the masters. the chiefs lost pro bowl left tackle orlando brown jr. to the bengals this offseason.

"editions: en/football/chelsea the blues have been struggling this season real madrid dealt a major blow to chelsea as los blancos eliminated the blues from the champions league quarter-finals after beating them - on aggregate. todd boehly landed at stamford bridge as a sports guru and his experience at the two-time european champions is starting to border on disaster. there are two sides to boehly. in the united states, he owns the mlb side los angeles dodgers. he took over, along with a prestigious investment group, in the midst of bankruptcy. the franchise got back on its feet and the results are backing the project. they bought the team in and made them champions of world series. under boehly\'s management, the dodgers became playoff regulars, reached three finals and won one. however, chelsea is the opposite case. they have been eliminated from all the competitions they competed in and they struggle in the premier league, where they are expected to miss out on european qualification for next season. boehly has already invested as many as million dollars in players at chelsea. he has done the same at the dodgers, with chief operating officer andrew friedman being the basic pillar of his project. friedman joined the club in and the team spent million dollars in payroll the year that they won the title. ""payrolls don\'t decide the standings, and i think we see evidence of that every year,"" friedman said. ""having a really deep and talented roster regardless of what your payroll is is the key to winning games, and that\'s what they have. and it\'s been through a lot of very shrewd moves, some through the draft, some through trades and all kinds of different creative ways of player procurement."" meanwhile, chelsea have spent big in several players such as enzo fernandez, mykhaylo mudryk, noni madueke, benoit badiashile and david fofana. ""i think the first step has been made. an incorrect step, but it has been made,"" thiago silva told tnt sports after the elimination at the hands of real madrid.

"craig burley debates whether frank lampard will ever secure another permanent managerial role in the premier league. (:) - stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga & more (u.s.) while we wait to see how much competitive balance the soccer gods elect to share with us, we\'re also awash in post-mortems. a number of the world\'s more successful and/or monied clubs are already out of the champions league running, and some have suffered dour league form as well. the present tense still has plenty of questions to answer, but let\'s look into the future a bit, as well. for the teams thus far eliminated from the champions league knockout rounds, what questions await as they attempt to prepare for greater success moving forward? last season: third place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by real madrid in the champions league quarterfinals this season: th place (on pace for points and - goal differential), eliminated by real madrid in the champions league quarterfinals most immediate issue to address: goals, obviously. for the comprehensiveness of chelsea\'s collapse in -, it\'s mostly shown up on one side of the ledger. the blues have still allowed the fourth-fewest goals and fifth-lowest xg averages, and while those aren\'t the greatest numbers this club has ever produced, it\'s not the problem. even with romelu lukaku and timo werner suffering through their own issues, chelsea was still third in premier league scoring last season; it sent both of those forwards away (werner permanently, lukaku on loan) and spent a market-redefining amount on a new team, and is averaging less than half the goals. the blues have fallen from fourth in shots per possession to ninth and from seventh in xg per shot to th. rb leipzig\'s christopher nkunku will arrive this summer, and the club has added five players -- including raheem sterling and the extremely expensive mykhaylo mudryk -- via transfer, plus felix on loan. they still have havertz, christian pulisic and hakim ziyech. in theory, this summer will be about thinning the attacker crop a good amount, crafting something cohesive out of what\'s left and then ceasing with the transfers for a while. this isn\'t football manager! last season: second place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by real madrid in the champions league final this season: six place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by real madrid in the champions league round of most immediate issue to address: defensive resistance. in matches last season, liverpool allowed opponents total shots, worth at least . xg. in just matches this season it has allowed and , respectively. when liverpool has struggled in the past under jurgen klopp, however briefly, it was almost always because opponents were creating too many high-quality looks in transition. it\'s the risk of klopp\'s high-wire, risk-reward pressing approach. as tends to be the case, liverpool is allowing the highest xg per shot average in the premier league this season, but any attempts at limiting shot quantity has fallen apart. liverpool defense, - (all competitions): . goals allowed per game, . xg allowed, . shots allowed per possession, . xg allowed per shot liverpool defense, - (all competitions): . goals allowed per game, . xg allowed, . shots allowed per possession, . xg allowed per shot that\'s a % increase in goals allowed and a % increase in xg, all with the same shot quality. liverpool\'s entire defensive apparatus has grown creaky, and the club has allowed the midfield to get particularly old. while it spent EUR million in transfer fees this season, roughly EURm of that went toward acquiring attackers darwin nunez and cody gakpo. let\'s see what midfielders it brings in this summer, and let\'s see how much of an immediate effect the additions have. last season: fourth place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated in the conference league group stage this season: seventh place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by ac milan in the champions league round of most immediate issue to address: a future identity (one that actually sticks). one minute into the usa network broadcast of sunday\'s tottenham-newcastle match, the announcer was declaring this a make-or-break week for spurs, who also play manchester united on thursday and at liverpool on sunday. as he was saying this, newcastle scored its first goal. it scored again four, seven, and minutes later on the way to a stunning - win. gab marcotti and julien laurens discuss tottenham\'s disastrous - loss to newcastle in the premier league. pochettino\'s spurs reached the champions league final and earned three straight premier league top-three finishes with an aggressive, proactive, possession-heavy approach. when that burned out, spurs hired three straight managers who play more reactive, counterattacking ball (but only after considering managers with completely different styles first). despite the successes on conte\'s resume, his version of reactive ball grew less and less successful over time. tottenham ranks th in shots allowed per possession this season; spurs also rank second in xg allowed per shot, but when you\'re giving opponents that many opportunities, and when your goalkeepers rank th in save percentage, you\'re going to allow too many goals. i\'m not sure what style would work best for spurs moving forward, but they\'ve wasted the past few years of harry kane\'s prime, refusing to ship him to another club for huge money while failing to craft anything cohesive around him. they need to actually craft a future vision and build around it, and thanks to the past few years of decision-making, it\'s hard to be confident in their ability to pull that off. last season: first place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by villarreal in the champions league quarterfinals this season: second place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by manchester city in the champions league quarterfinals most immediate issue to address: shot quality. over its past six matches, bayern has won only once, drawn twice, lost three times, found itself eliminated from both the champions league and dfb-pokal and has fallen to second in the bundesliga race. this all came after it inexplicably panic-fired manager julian nagelsmann, who had lost just three times in the season\'s first seven months. on one hand, you could say bayern has been unlucky -- in these six matches, it scored five goals from shots worth . xg, a dreadful finishing funk that won\'t last. on the other hand, xg averages aren\'t all the same. the higher percentage of particularly high-quality shots you create, the more likely you are to score, and bayern is creating fewer high-quality looks than ever. last year in all competitions, .% of its shots were worth at least . xg; this season it\'s just .%, and it\'s been just .% in these dismal six games. this is what happens when you lose robert lewandowski and replace him with a natural winger (sadio mane) and a -year-old (mathys tel). robert lewandowski, -: . shots per minutes, % worth . xg or more sadio mane, -: . shots per , % worth . xg or more mathys tel, -: . shots per , . xg per shot, % worth . xg or more with bayern losing its composure both in the boardroom (with the recent panic move) and locker room (with the dust-up between stars), it will be interesting to see whether the club digs itself more of a hole or if it quickly rights the ship. shot quality isn\'t its lone deficiency, but if it can add an excellent center-forward this summer -- napoli\'s victor osimhen? eintracht frankfurt\'s randal kolo muani? -- a lot of those other issues will take care of themselves. last season: second place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by rangers in the europa league round of this season: first place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by chelsea in the champions league round of most immediate issue to address: defensive passivity. bvb is on pace to almost perfectly match last year\'s point total and goal differential, but it\'s in first place now because of bayern\'s regression. still, it had erling haaland last year and has battled a steady stream of injuries and illness this season, so the fact that it\'s on a similar pace is an accomplishment. opponents are attempting % of their shots in the box (th) and averaging . shots per possession (th), however, and this passivity was magnified in the champions league, where opponents averaged . shots per possession. goalkeeper gregor kobel played brilliantly (. save percentage in the champions league), but elite opponents are still too comfortable and settled in attack, and bvb will likely have to improve on that without star midfielder jude bellingham next season. there are two directions bvb could go from here. either it commits to a reactive, counterattacking approach -- and with winger karim adeyemi\'s speed, that isn\'t entirely unattractive -- or it does what borussia dortmund tends to do: attack. with the money it would get from a potential bellingham transfer, it would need to seek out players (midfielders in particular) who can put pressure on opponents and make them more uncomfortable in buildup if it wants to advance further in europe. last season: third place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by rangers in the europa league semifinals this season: fifth place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by manchester city in the champions league round of wednesday, may (all times et) * valencia vs. villarreal (: p.m.) * stuttgart vs. frankfurt (: p.m.) * atletico madrid vs.

(: p.m.) friday, may (all times et) rb leipzig can still sometimes hit you in transition, but its pressing game hasn\'t created as much opportunity as usual, and as with bvb, its attacking numbers are down. that\'s somewhat understandable considering star christopher nkunku\'s injury issues, but he has gone after this year anyway, so it has to figure out how to better create opportunities moving forward. leipzig also needs much, much better goalkeeping. it has lost matches this season, and in nine of them, its goalkeeper was in the negative in goals prevented (the difference between goals allowed and the post-shot xg value of the shots on target that he faced). it is eighth in the league in goals prevented this season and th in save percentage. peter gulacsi has missed much of the season with a torn acl, but he had a dreadful % save percentage before his injury, and backup janis blaswich is at only %. they are also and years old, respectively. a refresh is probably needed. last season: th place ( points, - goal differential), won the europa league this season: ninth place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by napoli in the champions league round of most immediate issue to address: depth. it was forgivable last season, when eintracht faded dismally in league play while focusing entirely on its miraculous europa league run. it won it and therefore qualified for the champions league, so it didn\'t matter that it only pulled points from its last bundesliga matches. it matters a bit more that it has pulled only four points from its past eight matches this season. eintracht reached the champions league knockout stages -- its best performance in europe\'s biggest competition in years -- during a solid fall run, but it bowed out meekly against napoli and, with help from injuries, it seems to have completely run out of gas. with this season\'s champions league revenue -- plus the funds from a potential transfer for star randal kolo muani if it is unable to keep him -- eintracht simply needs to add more capable bodies. it also needs a more balanced midfield. it has crafted an odd style under oliver glasner -- one too direct to be a possession team, but not nearly direct enough to sport a defense-and-countering identity. it ranks th out of in the bundesliga in shots per possession, and in what i define as ""transition possessions"" (possessions that start outside the attacking third and last or fewer seconds), it ranks th in goals allowed. it really feels like an upgrade is needed in central midfield. sebastian rode (, minutes in all competitions) is years old, and daichi kamada (, minutes) is out of contract this summer. djibril sow is solid, but needs more sturdy help, as glasner\'s attack-minded --- formation has resulted in a little too much stress and midfield isolation in a bundesliga less vulnerable to pressing and attack. last season: third place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by barcelona in the europa league round of this season: first place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by ac milan in the champions league quarterfinals most immediate issue to address: again, depth. it feels odd to put the soon-to-be scudetto winners -- their magic number for clinching their first serie a title in years is down to four points -- on any sort of ""disappointments"" list. but for as grand as the celebrations will be when they eventually clinch the title, their form indeed suffered just enough this spring to remind us that they aren\'t yet a finished product. still, there\'s been obvious evolution in nearly every statistical category this season, and a lot of it stems from a nearly perfect set of summer transfers. the addition of khvicha ""kvaradona"" kvaratskhelia had obvious effects -- he has goals and assists in all competitions -- but the team also added immediate stalwarts in defender kim min-jae from fenerbahce and midfielder andre-frank zambo anguissa from fulham. keeping on-loan forward giovanni simeone from hellas could be vital if the club ends up biting on a big transfer offer for osimhen. no one gets a+ transfer-window grades year after year, but clubs like liverpool and ac milan have proved that if you can nail a couple in a row, you can completely transform your club. napoli is not yet a finished product from a depth perspective, but it is one more great summer away from another potential scudetto and champions league run. last season: first place ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by real madrid in champions league round of this season: first place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by bayern in champions league round of most immediate issue to address: what does psg want to be? ligue has been particularly watchable this season, but in a sea of fun middleweights, the team with kylian mbappe, lionel messi and a sometimes-healthy neymar is going to once again run away with the title, just as it did (with almost identical rate stats) last season. neither familiar contenders like marseille and monaco nor the rising lens could avoid potholes, and psg was once again too talented for france and too imbalanced for a champions league run. no matter who suits up next season, psg will be the favorite once again. that\'s the way ligue works right now. but while the big summer story in paris could be messi\'s likely departure after just two seasons, and the mbappe transfer rumor industry is always looking for just a single shred of a reason to kick into fifth gear, there\'s still a long-term building project to watch. sporting director luis campos has been on the job for only a year, and he completely transformed psg\'s aging midfield, adding the likes of vitinha ( years old), nuno mendes (), fabian ruiz (), carlos soler () and nordi mukiele (), who have combined for nearly , minutes at midfield and wingback this season. warren zaire-emery, just years old, has also contributed minutes. last season: third place in the primeira liga ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by ajax in the champions league round of this season: first place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by inter in the champions league quarterfinals most immediate issue to address: keeping goncalo ramos. we know how things tend to work for portugal\'s top clubs in the overall european food chain: play quality ball, succeed domestically, acquit yourself well (but not too well) in the champions league and send your best players to bigger clubs, usually in the premier league. dan thomas is joined by craig burley, shaka hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. stream on espn+ (u.s. only). benfica will have another shot at particularly strong ball next year, but it will probably require holding onto -year-old forward goncalo ramos, a.k.a. the primary reason it was so strong without nunez, who has scored goals in all competitions this season. benfica will be as good as normal without him, but it could be special if he stays in lisbon for one more season. last season: first place in the primeira liga ( points, + goal differential), eliminated by lyon in the europa league round of this season: second place (on pace for points, + goal differential), eliminated by inter in the champions league round of most immediate issue to address: the balance between veterans and young star power. porto lost vitinha to psg and fabio viera to arsenal and fell behind a torrid benfica in the fall. it looked like the league race was lost, but it has pulled points from seven matches to pull within four points; it also outplayed inter for large portions of their champions league tie, but somehow none of its shot attempts, worth a combined . xg, found the net. poor finishing, plus saves from inter\'s andre onana, doomed porto. last season: first place in

"untold arsenal: supporting the club, the manager and the team ""i believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art."" a wenger by bulldog drummond through this season we have, before most matches, had a look at the league table based on the last six games, as this can often indicate which way a match is likely to turn, better than looking at the conventional table for the whole season. and normally in doing this we don't run the whole ""last six"" table, but just the bit at the top showing arsenal, and wherever the club arsenal are playing is sitting. but really, to fully appreciate the drop in arsenal's form of late and the position of chelsea, we do need to see the full table... of course this doesn't actually mean that arsenal are not qualifying for the champions league next season, nor that chelsea are heading for the championship, but it does show the decline in both clubs of late. and that is with mykhaylo mudryk who cost EUR.m, raheem sterling at EUR.m, noni madueke (EUR.m), pierre-emerick aubameyang (EUR.m), david datro fofana (EUR.m), and joao felix on loan for a hefty fee (of which no one is quite sure how much it is). it really is a frightening statistic, not least because it starts in just after the end of the unbeaten season, when arsenal were still a force and a half to be reckoned with. oh yes and manchester united looks like it might be sold to a very rich person. next up: the team. yes chelsea spent PS.m. but they did it without buying a centre forward, the one position everyone could see they needed to fill. looking deeper its not clear what their strategy actually was or if they even had one. the big difference from the abramovich era is that roman would hire a manager then go out and buy the players the manager wanted. then when the manager was inevitably fired he'd do the same thing again. the current owners on the other hand bought a bunch of players then hired a manager to try and turn them into a team. so yes spending doesn't ensure success but its worked pretty well for manchester city over the years and chelsea under the russian. clearly though its not just how much you spend but how well you spend it. chelsea have spent about as badly as its possible to spend. jod very well said. i have said, and have demonstrated it many times with statistics, that spending big is the only way to succeed. yes, you can spend big and fail, especially now as so many teams spend big, but you cannot, not spend big and expect to succeed. we are back were we are not simply because we have arteta, but because we have arteta, and we have allowed him to spend a lot of money, in fact one hell off a lot more money that wenger was ever allowed to spend. chelsea are where they are because they have an idiot owner who has so much more money than sense. simple. d \t\t\t\t\ttheme by seos themes'}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-05-02T12:30:37Z
" nemanja matic has issued a warning to mauricio pochettino about a problem he will have with the blues next season, if he takes over at chelsea. the defensive midfielder, who played more than times for the club between -, had his say on his old side's current plight. chelsea lost - away at arsenal on tuesday night and are th in the premier league table, losing every game under interim boss frank lampard following graham potter's sacking. they appear to be closing in on a deal to make pochettino the next permanent boss but matic thinks the argentine will need time to fix the issues he'll be presented with. 'i think so (pochettino will need time), he told sky sports. former chelsea star, nemanja matic, now at roma, thinks the club have an issue next season chelsea are in crisis and lost against arsenal on tuesday night amid a dismal run of form he also pointed out that not all of those young stars, the likes of enzo fernandez, mykhaylo mudryk and noni madueke - who were all part of new owner todd boehly's PSm-plus spending spree since taking over - will develop at the same rate. 'some will need time to adapt to the premier league,' the -year-old went on. 'they will need six more months or one season to adapt, but during that transition the experienced players can help them.

" as they gladly close out what has been a disastrous season both on and off the pitch, chelsea seem to be saving the worst until last after one of their most spineless and calamitous displays yet against arsenal on tuesday night. it took the gunners just minutes to wipe out frank lampard's sorry side at the emirates, with most visiting supporters heading for the exits long before the half-time whistle after watching their team fall three goals behind. while they did manage to pull a goal back after the break, noni madueke's strike was not enough to spark a miraculous comeback and chelsea instead slumped to a sixth defeat in six under floundering caretaker boss lampard. chelsea's nightmare season went from bad to worse in a dismal defeat at arsenal on tuesday . benoit badiashile perhaps the only player on this list who can hold his head high, badiashile has barely put a foot wrong when called upon this season and, with that in mind, his lack of minutes under lampard is incredibly puzzling. the french centre back is physically strong, quick and reliable in the air, and at years of age he looks a mature head on young shoulders. yet he has only been afforded one appearance in lampard's six games at the helm so far. one of the few positives for boehly to take from an otherwise catastrophic couple of transfer windows is badiashile, who looks capable of one day filling thiago silva's shoes when the -year-old eventually bows out. . enzo fernandez enzo fernandez (left) and benoit badiashile (right) have both shown glimpses of their quality yet in a more settled team next term alongside a sharper n'golo kante in midfield, and with compatriot mauricio pochettino potentially in charge, the argentina world cup winner can begin to show his worth. . wesley fofana like badiashile, the -year-old is another centre back whose calming nature on the ball often defies his years, and paying PSm to prise him away from leicester is likely to prove superb business later down the line. as lampard's men were ripped apart by both arsenal and real madrid, he endured torrid nights against the likes of gabriel jesus and vinicius jnr, though it is fair to say he was not alone in capitulating on both evenings in question. the positives from his debut season at chelsea undoubtedly outweigh the negatives and he has all the tools to lead the blues' backline for the next decade, meaning boehly can mark fofana down as one of his few business successes this season. wesley fofana has let errors creep into his game of late but he has enjoyed a solid first season the french centre back endured a torrid outing in tuesday night's - defeat away at arsenal . joao felix (loan) after serving a three-match suspension, he began demonstrating his mouthwatering ability on the ball upon his return and got on the scoresheet twice in his first six premier league outings thereafter. but for a player as talented as felix, chances do not come at a premium and the one glaring flaw in his arsenal is a lack of end product. in premier league appearances so far, the -year-old has averaged . shots from inside the box per game, meaning his tally of two goals speaks volumes about the number of opportunities he wastes. his ambiguous playing position, with lampard admitting prior to tuesday's defeat at arsenal that he is unclear which role suits him best, also represents a problem and suggests chelsea will not seek a permanent deal this summer. joao felix has talent but lacks end product in the final third and is unlikely to join permanently . kalidou koulibaly after arriving from napoli last summer with a reputation as one of the best central defenders in european football, koulibaly has somewhat failed to live up to the hype in a rollercoaster of a debut campaign. a terrific strike on his home bow against tottenham was followed by an encouraging first few months, only for his form to drop off in dramatic fashion after the world cup break. and just when he seemed to be finding his feet again last month, the senegal international picked up a hamstring injury which may well have ended his season prematurely. while he has hopped on board a sinking ship, and it can also be argued that he rocked up in english football with his best years behind him at , koulibaly's first season at chelsea will go down as a slight disappointment. . raheem sterling sterling only cost chelsea PSm last summer which, considering the scale of his achievements at manchester city, where he scored goals in games while winning four premier league titles, was rightly considered a bargain at the time. yet glancing back at that fee months on, the same assessment can't be made after what has been a miserable debut season at the bridge. raheem sterling's arrival for PSmillion seemed a bargain when chelsea pulled it off but the former manchester city winger has looked a shadow of the player he once was the england winger has scored just four times in league outings this term and looks a shadow of the player who previously flourished under pep guardiola at city, although when considering he spent the majority of this campaign operating in a disjointed blues side led by an underqualified potter maybe that is no surprise. there is no doubting the quality sterling possesses. his cv in english football speaks for itself. however, as a senior member of the squad at years of age, chelsea needed him to step up to the plate and inspire those around him throughout testing periods this season, and it is difficult to pick out many occasions when he has done so. his move therefore can't be considered anything but a failure as of yet. . noni madueke prior to this week's clash with arsenal, the england under star's first half-season at chelsea would have been graded as unsuccessful given his lack of action. it may have only been one game, but madueke's spirited and at times inventive performance was a sneak peek of the potential he clearly obtains. and at PSm, the blues will not be concerned about taking a huge financial hit. . denis zakaria (loan) when he was finally brought into the side, it was baffling as to what took so long. . marc cucurella given the PSm price tag and teacher's pet jibes after following potter from brighton, not to mention his eye-catching hair, cucurella has almost become a poster boy and scapegoat for chelsea's expensive struggles throughout this season. criticism of the spaniard has at times crossed the line - no player deserves to be jeered by his own supporters - yet when taking that out of consideration it can only be concluded that he has looked worryingly out of his depth. marc cucurella has almost become a poster boy for chelsea's expensive struggles this term the PSmillion buy looks out of his depth and could be better off departing this summer particularly in home defeats against arsenal, manchester city and aston villa earlier in the campaign, as well as the draw at west ham, which sparked unjustified booing from the away end, cucurella has struggled defensively and offered very little going forward. in a -- system, it is still unclear whether he is most comfortable at left wing-back or on the left side of a defensive trio, and if not for a probable lack of suitors chelsea may be better off cutting their losses this summer. . mykhaylo mudryk many argued at the time that boehly and co had paid well over the odds considering the -year-old only racked up senior appearances in ukraine before sealing a mega-money move to one of europe's major clubs. and following an underwhelming start to life in england, that PSm fee is already looking rather questionable. mykhaylo mudryk has resembled a player devoid of confidence since his PSmillion move a breathtaking debut off the bench at liverpool has been followed by flashes of quality in recent weeks, but the ukrainian youngster is clearly a work in progress and needs time to adjust to the pace and power of the premier league. . carney chukwuemeka one of their cheaper recruits last summer at PSm, chukwuemeka hardly represents a financial gamble for chelsea and he has impressed when used off the bench this season. a loan move to a fellow premier league club this summer would be an ideal next step in the -year-old midfielder's development. . pierre-emerick aubameyang eyebrows were raised when chelsea paid PSm to prise aubameyang away from barcelona last summer, given his prior fall from grace at arsenal and bust-up with mikel arteta. those question marks initially seemed out of place when the gabon international powered home three goals in his first four matches, however since then his blues career has very much been on a downward trajectory. pierre-emerick aubameyang's disastrous chelsea spell was summed up by an abject display at arsenal on tuesday night on tuesday night he made a surprise return to the starting lineup on a hostile return to arsenal, and his abject display in a shambolic chelsea performance pretty much encapsulated his spell at the club. . david datro fofana share what you think",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-05-05T14:58:51Z
" the premier league season came to an end on sunday, with everton staying up at the expense of leicester and leeds. it was a season with engaging battles for the title, european places and relegation. but it was a strange season, too. but we did have another break this season for a winter world cup, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. bbc sport takes a look at some of the unusual things to happen this season... this was a season of unprecedented managerial overhauls, with changes in total. chelsea, leeds and southampton sacked two managers each. including caretakers and interims, several of whom were chopped and changed, people took charge of at least one premier league game this season. only one of the managers - graham potter going from brighton to chelsea - left out of choice. and he ended up being two of the changes as he was sacked by chelsea after less than seven months. only nine of the premier league teams ended the season with the same manager who started it. all three relegated teams - leicester, leeds and southampton - ended the season with short-term managers whose deals have expired. chelsea are set to appoint mauricio pochettino to replace stop-gap frank lampard, who started the season as everton boss. roy hodgson and ryan mason are out of contract at crystal palace and tottenham respectively. chelsea\'s - season will live long in the memory, but not for the right reasons. the blues finished in the bottom half (th) for the first time since -, but that is barely half the story. since todd boehly took over as owner at the end of last season, they have spent PSm on players and had four different managers (including interims) this season. boehly sacked champions league-winning manager thomas tuchel before appointing potter on a five-year deal and paying PSm compensation for him and his coaching staff. seven months later, potter was sacked and his deputy bruno saltor took interim charge. he was given one game before boehly brought back lampard - the man who had been sacked a couple of years ago, leading to tuchel\'s arrival. they only won once in his -game spell. tuchel, meanwhile, ended the season winning the bundesliga with bayern munich. and pochettino is now on his way to stamford bridge. for all the managerial changes, it was a big surprise steve cooper was not one of them. he was widely expected to be sacked when forest were bottom after eight games, but instead he got a new contract. it worked in the end as forest stayed up, with all four teams below them changing managers. this season we all - well, not the teams involved - enjoyed a really open relegation tussle. eventually teams started to pull away - and southampton stayed where they were - but it was still the first season since - that no team were relegated after games. by the final day it was between everton, leicester and leeds for the final two relegation places - with abdoulaye doucoure keeping the toffees up with the only goal against bournemouth. referees\' body pgmol spent more time than it would want apologising for video assistant referee mistakes. there are not always apologies for mistakes - and apologies are not always public - so there is no way to know how prevalent it is. but we do know brighton have had three apologies. after rounds of games, there were incorrect var interventions, missed interventions and var errors for on-field offences. there were correct interventions during that time. that\'s not even mentioning liverpool defender andy robertson claiming he was elbowed by an assistant referee and reds boss jurgen klopp injuring his hamstring after shouting at a fourth official. by the end of the season, pgmol chief howard webb gave his time to sky sports and bbc radio live to explain some of the mistakes. some teams gave players who were not going to the world cup anywhere between a few days to a couple of weeks off, while other teams flew to the other side of the world. the united arab emirates, australia, saudi arabia, spain and portugal were some of the destinations - with about half of the premier league teams playing friendlies during that time. liverpool and arsenal played games in the dubai super cup, everton were in the sydney cup, crystal palace hosted brazilian side botafogo, a few teams faced la liga clubs and fulham even hosted west ham in a london derby the week before christmas. the table looked quite different then, with arsenal top at christmas, chelsea only off the european places on goal difference and wolves bottom. and cristiano ronaldo was a manchester united player. the amount of world cup players did not seem to have a detrimental effect on the second half of the season. a league-high of manchester city\'s squad went to qatar and they won the title, while only two southampton players, a joint low, did and they sank to the bottom. for much of the season, it looked as though arsenal were going to win their first title since the \'invincibles\' of -. but they suffered the same fate liverpool have in recent years and were unable to keep up city\'s relentless winning form in the second half of the campaign. mikel arteta\'s side spent days top - the most without finishing first in english top-flight history - yet city wrapped up the title with three games to go. since guardiola took over in , city have taken between and points in their final games of a premier league season - an average of . points per game. city have been favourites to win the league every year since -, with arsenal starting the campaign at - sixth favourites. premier league champions city now turn their sights to the treble. they face manchester united in the fa cup final and inter milan in the champions league final in the next two saturdays. win both and they become the second team to win all three after united in -. revelatory documentary detailing life in the jewish hasidic breslov community in israel greg jenner and his ""suspects"" take a forensic look at the world-famous novelist agatha christie spotlight investigates how failings in secret surveillance were exposed \'the phenomenal\' aj styles talks about his career in wwe adam peaty discusses his struggles with depression, explaining the effects it has had on his life as a family man and as an elite swimmer. everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment. the latest rumours and stories from around the world of football. analysis and opinion from our chief football writer. how to get into football -

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

" "" chelsea's interim manager frank lampard described manchester city as an outstanding side and said they have set the benchmark for excellence in the premier league under pep guardiola. five titles in six seasons underlines city's dominance and while guardiola insists every season gets harder, it is difficult to see who is ready to knock them off the summit. here is a look at the clubs most likely to give city a run for their money next season. arsenal mikel arteta's young side ultimately crumbled under city's relentless charge in the latter months of this season, but should be applauded for how they set the pace for so long and threatened to win their first title since . arteta, a disciple of guardiola's methods, restored arsenal's identity this season with a vibrant style of football and a squad packed with exciting young players will have learned valuable lessons from this campaign. liverpool juergen klopp's side have had some epic title battles with manchester city in recent years, winning the trophy in and twice coming second with more than points. they were off the pace this time, however, after failing to adequately replace forward sadio mane and seeing several key members of the klopp golden era lose form. manchester united united's first season under erik ten hag has been an encouraging one with a top-four finish all but guaranteed and the league cup trophy in the bag. tottenham hotspur striker harry kane is one target who could elevate united from a side scrapping to get into the top-four to one capable of making a sustained title run. chelsea chelsea's season has been appalling, despite spending around million pounds ($ million) on players since co-owners todd boehly and behdad eghbali took charge of the club. it is quite hard to see how they will go from a bottom-half finish to challenging near the top next season. but they are blessed with some highly-gifted young players such as reece james, noni madueke and mykhaylo mudryk and in mauricio pochettino, who will almost certainly be taking charge, they will have the perfect manger to begin a new project. newcastle united a year ago newcastle fans were just happy to still be supporting a premier league club. but after a superb season under eddie howe they are set to return to the champions league for the first time in two decades and are likely to spend heavily in the summer. with some astute business in the market it is not hard to see newcastle consolidating their new top-four status and perhaps even going higher.",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-05-22T04:53:01Z

season but coming up short at the business end of the campaign, there is an extremely good squad already assembled and arsenal will be in the uefa champions league next season. that means extra experience and quality will be needed. arteta continues to rejuvenate an already stunning attack that includes gabriel jesus, bukayo saka, gabriel martinelli and captain martin odegaard, but it is perhaps in midfield and defense where he will look to do business this summer. below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on arsenal transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. rice has long been linked with a move to arsenal or manchester united but it is believed that west ham's asking price for their captain and central midfielder (who is out of contract next summer) is putting up premier league clubs. bayern appear to be ready to pay close to the $ million west ham want for rice. is he worth it? he is. there is perhaps no better two-way central midfielder under the age of in europe and rice's ceiling is extremely high. (jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

(ae) the latest reports on mykhaylo mudryk to arsenal have arrived and although the gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the ukraine international winger has flown to turkey and gone on tour with them. shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and mudryk, , has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. he is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent. that said, a report from the daily express suggests that shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $ million and some compromises are being found. this all hinges on how much arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. the structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

(nm) a report from espn says that neymar is willing to leave psg this summer despite having four years left on his lucrative contract with les parisiens. per the report, psg would be happy to move on neymar 'if the right offer materializes' and it has seemed that way for a while. neymar, , has struggled with injuries and the report states that the brazilian superstar is now open to moving on from psg. as for the player, there's no doubting neymar's ability but his injury record in recent seasons will be a concern and so too will the transfer fee psg will likely demand for one of the top players on the planet who has four years left on his current contract. neymar is reportedly paid almost $ million per year by psg so it will be intriguing to see if those wages are matched by chelsea, or another premier league club. mac allister's shown his premier league mettle, though the world cup winner won't be an inexpensive purchase and might he want to stick around brighton if the seagulls and liverpool are in the same european competition or, perhaps, if brighton's in the superior competition. mac allister could be lured without competition given chelsea already has his world cup-winning midfield mate enzo fernandez. the corresponding wage bump could be enough to convince the argentine to focus on a domestic run in england. (nm) it sure sounds like someone different will join the chelsea goalkeeper competition next season. after the below reports that chelsea was eyeballing leeds' youngster illan meslier, there's more talk that the blues wants fresh blood between the posts. andre onana, , has been a shining star at inter milan and would be of interest to a great deal of teams should he hit the transfer market. fichajes says chelsea loves the idea of onana in london. and will chelsea's possible (probable?) failure to make the uefa champions league stop prospects from seeing stamford bridge as a - possibility? (nm) kepa arrizabalaga has taken the proverbial no. shirt from edouard mendy, and could that mean an exit for the senegalese goalkeeper as multiple reports say chelsea's informed mendy he can find a new home this summer. the -year-old mendy, of course, won the champions league with chelsea in but they're apparently happy to let him move on in the summer despite a contract settled through the - season. that much time left on a deal -- and status as senegal's no. goalkeeper -- should net chelsea some money and the blues may be ready to spend it right back on leeds united keeper illan meslier. meslier is just years old and made a huge impression on the premier league last season with leeds, though this season has seen ups-and-down for the club, kepa leads the league in save percentage but meslier is well off that pace. and only leicester's danny ward and southampton's (also young) gavin bazunu rate worse in goals prevented according to fotmob. football insider says $ million is leeds' asking price for meslier. (nm) world cup winner alexis mac allister is ""ready"" to leave brighton and hove albion this summer, and a host of premier league big boys want to secure his services. mac allister, , has been absolutely massive at brighton and his work as a feature player in argentina's world cup win only served to elevate his standing. chelsea, liverpool, newcastle, and spurs are linked with the most interest and each carries a reasonable link to mac allister but would any make more sense than a reunion with -year-old international teammate enzo fernandez? at some point chelsea is going to have to rein in the spending but the midfield still holds plenty of potential transfer energy with mateo kovacic linked with man city, n'golo kante injured and not getting any younger, and mason mount still yet to agree a new deal. mac allister is a hungry, complete, and forward-thinking midfielder who doesn't shy away from a tackle. he's a huge part of why the seagulls have been able to navigate so many sales and does seem likely, along with moises caicedo, to be the next to leave the amex stadium... especially if the brighton can't get european football.

'i'm a fast player, a crosser and box-to-box.' there's going to be change around everton, and chelsea may be taking advantage of it. this is all according to metro. at some point chelsea won't be able to spend more money but everton needs it and seemingly gordon's figure has dropped a little given his drop down the toffees' pecking order. it all seems wild, but this is chelsea in -. (nm) chelsea could be set to live life without pierre-emerick aubameyang and raheem sterling as reports circulate that barcelona would like to take ""auba"" back to spain and that the blues are open to offers for sterling this winter. the sterling sale would be stunning as new chelsea owner todd boehly is showing little patience when it comes to making things fit for new boss graham potter. who could afford sterling? very few, and sterling would not be able to help several clubs' champions league pushes. coming in would be psv eindhoven star noni madueke. the london-born winger came through the academies of crystal palace and tottenham before moving to psv at age . madueke, , has goals and assists in senior appearances for psv and is said to carry a $ million price tag. a right winger and attacking midfielder, madueke has. a tantalizing profile highlighted by dribbling, ball progression, and comfort in the attacking penalty area. he's not afraid of a tackle, relatively speaking, either.

(nm) update: this deal has been confirmed by chelsea, dec. brazil u- starlet andrey santos is reportedly todd boehly's latest transfer swoop, according to multiple reports. santos, a central midfielder turns in may, has eight goals in serie b matches for vasco da gama in brazil. he's reportedly carrying a $ million price tag. chelsea previously added youngsters carney chukwuemeka and gabriel ""gaga"" slonina to the fold in the summer, and were linked with endrick earlier this month, but the player will instead join real madrid in the summer of . todd boehly is working hard to make sure his new manager gets his men, and graham potter will have former psg starlet and current leipzig star christopher nkunku come summer. french international nkunku, , missed the world cup with torn knee ligaments but had scored times with four assists in appearances across all competitions for leipzig early this season. when he's back fit and firing, it will likely be for the blues in the premier league rb leipzig duo christopher nkunku and josko gvardiol are both being lined up to arrive at chelsea next summer. a report from the athletic states that chelsea have offered to pay leipzig more than nkunku $ million release clause (which kicks in next summer) and want to wrap up a deal which would see the -year-old french international arrive at stamford bridge next summer. the report says that nkunku has already agreed to the deal, while our partners in the uk at sky sports believe the prolific striker (who has already scored six goals in eight bundesliga games this season) has yet to make up his mind. a story out of the netherlands says chelsea's sent waves through ajax camp with a $ million bid for mexico star edson alvarez. the report says that newcastle and rennes came calling for alvarez but ajax would not be moved, but this chelsea offer has seriously turned the player's head. alvarez, , operates as a central defensive midfielder but is not one-dimensional and has spent a little but of time at center back and a bit more more advanced, too. he's been a regular starter and will want regular playing time ahead of the world cup. chelsea can provide some given injuries and schedule congestion. (nm) according to fabrizio romano, chelsea and barcelona are locked in talks over deals for pierre-emerick aubameyang, , and marco alonso, . aubameyang will have extra medical checks after his jaw was reportedly broken by attackers on his home in barcelona earlier this week, while alonso has agreed personal terms with barca many months ago and has been waiting for the two clubs to agree a fee in a separate deal. (jpw) pierre aubameyang update. the two clubs are in direct contact today as they want to reach an agreement in the next hours -- been told that marcos alonso is again discussed as part of the deal. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc ready to give everything! :blue_heart:#fofanaischelsea a report from football insider claims that chelsea have offered conor gallagher and armando broja, plus $ million, for anthony gordon. the -year-old winger scored for the toffees in their - draw at brentford at the weekend and showcased his wonderful speed on the break and his incredible work rate. gallagher and broja have worked so hard on loan spells over the years but it just doesn't seem like they're gong to become regulars at chelsea under thomas tuchel. they could definitely be stars at everton and if the toffees get the duo (permanently or on loan) plus get a good chunk of cash for gordon, that is a very good deal for them. gordon is good but frank lampard and the everton board should snap chelsea's hand off. (jpw) wesley fofana, , is reportedly in the usa undergoing his chelsea medical as his transfer from leicester city edges closer. the athletic are reporting that fofana flew to the u.s. on sunday as chelsea's co-owner todd boehly wanted extra checks after fofana fractured his leg at the start of last season. it is believed chelsea and fofana have agreed terms on a six-year deal, as the transfer fee with leicester could rise to almost $ million. (jpw) :police_car_light: excl: chelsea send wesley fofana to usa for medical. flew yesterday - owners decision for peace of mind. move should be done by midweek#cfc have reservations over aubameyang deal  gordon looking unlikely & more @theathleticuk #lcfc #fcbarcelona #efc callum hudson-odoi is heading to germany, as the england international will join bayer leverkusen on loan according to our partners in the uk at sky sports. hudson-odoi, , has struggled to get in to thomas tuchel's plans this season and his career has stalled due to injuries and a loss of form over the last months. the tricky winger will hope playing regularly for leverkusen, who are in the uefa champions league, will get him back to his best and help him make a late push for the england squad ahead of the world cup this summer. after being linked with newcastle, leicester and southampton, this is a good move for cho and he will become a key man for bayer in the bundesliga. (jpw) a report from the guardian says that chelsea have renewed their interest in wilfried zaha as the crystal palace winger has less than a year left on his current contract. zaha, , has been linked with chelsea, tottenham and arsenal on multiple occasions over the years and a report from the independent says his agent is pushing for a move to chelsea. the guardian says that pierre-emerick aubameyang is still chelsea's top target but zaha is another option. it seems like chelsea and leicester city have finally agreed a fee for wesley fofana, as the athletic believe an agreement is in place. chelsea badly want, and need, a new center back and fofana, , will be perfect for their system and style of play. he has been left out of training at leicester in recent days after having his head turned and on the eve of chelsea hosting leicester (fofana will not be playing) the two clubs have agreed a fee. it is believed that fee will be a world-record for a defender and fofana is worth it. (jpw) a report from cbs sports says that chelsea and barcelona are close to agreeing a $. million fee for pierre-emerick aubameyang. the -year-old is closing in on a reunion with thomas tuchel and a return to london and the premier league. given barcelona's financial situation, and their plethora of new attacking talents, letting aubameyang go makes sense. chelsea need a clinical finisher to put away the chances tuchel's side create game after game and having auba, raheem sterling and mason mount in attack is a very good trio. this will give chelsea's attack a ruthless edge, which they badly need, and will be a huge boost in their push for a top four finish. (jpw) aubameyang to chelsea is now very close and is a straight-cash deal. leicester manager brendan rodgers is expected to leave wesley fofana out of his matchday squad when the foxes face southampton on saturday, as the -year-old center back tries to force through a transfer to chelsea. the blues have had two previous bids for the frenchman rejected, but new owner todd boehly has thus far been undeterred. this isn't quite the point of no return for fofana, but the developing saga is trending that direction. (ae) chelsea are set to step up their pursuit of pierre-emerick aubameyang, as a meeting is scheduled to discuss doing a deal for aubameyang. per the report from fabrizio romano, chelsea will soon make their opening bid to barcelona for aubameyang as the -year-old is a top target in the final weeks of the transfer window. according to multiple reports out of the uk, chelsea offered everton $. million for -year-old midfielder anthony gordon, the breakout star and a rare bright spot in the toffees' - season, but the blues were swiftly rejected with a further bid expected in the not-so-distant future. when it comes to chelsea, are they overpaying for players this summer? marc cucurella, raheem sterling and kalidou koulibaly have all arrived for huge transfer fees and it seems like chelsea's new owners are paying somewhat of a premium because they are, well, chelsea's new owners. todd boehly is getting a lot of stick for paying over the odds and only time will tell if cucurella, fofana and co. are worth these huge transfer fees. the focus at chelsea will likely now be on selling players and they will have to move on a lot of fringe players to offset this huge spending spree. (jpw) chelsea are willing to go to PSm for fofana and believe that would be enough to get him. would take their spending over PSm and could be more beyond that (fdj, casadei, auba targeted). so are they going to be able to make anything back on sales? #cfc chelsea\'s latest bid for wesley fofana is over PSm and won\'t be the last one made if rejected. brendan rodgers again said fofana isn\'t for sale, but todd boehly means business. fofana is chelsea\'s number one target between now and when window shuts. longtime chelsea leader and captain cesar ""dave"" azpilicueta is not going back to spain after all. meanwhile, football.london says that brighton manager graham potter has removed marc cucurella from first-team training amid reports of a fee agreement with chelsea. now that agreement has been denied by brighton, but it does make it seem like cucurella is moving closer to getting his transfer request. keep an eye on this space. (nm) would aubameyang be a good fit for chelsea? he would fit their system and we know he's a great finisher. aubameyang could also add plenty of experience to a very youthful attack and if he's happy and teams are playing to his strengths. thomas tuchel will be wary of aubameyang potential throwing his toys out of the pram like he did at arsenal but the player and coach know each other extremely well from their time together at borussia dortmund, which was hugely successful for auba. blue suits you, @chukwuemekaa! :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes: read all about it! #chukwuemekaischelsea marc cucurella to chelsea, here we go! full agreement in place between chelsea and brighton for more than PSm. levi colwill on the verge of joining brighton soon. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc chelsea has added a pair of highly-rated teenagers this tuesday. usmnt goalkeeper gabriel ""gaga"" slonina will carry a bit more interest in america, where the teenager has been unveiled by chelsea on a six-year deal that includes a loan back to chicago for the rest of the mls season [ more info here ] then there's england youth international carney chukwuemeka, the -year-old who was willing to run down his contract at aston villa. rather than lose him for nothing in next summer, steven gerrard's villans have sold chukwuemeka to the blues for a reported $ million. not a bad return. (nm) chelsea are pushing to hijack marc cucurella deal! direct talk today with brighton - levi colwill could be part of the negotiation. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc so, is this actually going to happen!? it seems like this deal for -year-old usmnt goalkeeper gabriel slonina has dragged on and on, but there is no real rush on either side as slonina will be heading back to the chicago fire on loan. as we've said below, slonina will eventually head to chelsea over the next year or so and his next step is to head out on loan in europe. the american goalkeeper has a very bright future and this is a good move for him to enter the european market and have a huge club like chelsea handling his development. (jpw) gabriel slonina's agent jaime garcia has informed chicago fire that they reached an agreement on personal terms with chelsea. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc cfc will submit official bid and send paperworks, after verbal agreement with chicago: m plus add-ons. manchester city internal decision: oleksandr zinchenko can leave the club, arsenal are prepared to submit an official proposal. :police_car_light: #afc nathan ake stays at the club after talk with guardiola despite personal terms agreed with chelsea. #mcfc kalidou koulibaly to chelsea, here we go! full agreement in place for EURm fee add-ons completed, bid accepted. napoli are checking the documents then it will be official. :police_car_light::blue_circle: #cfc he\'s here! :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:#sterlingischelsea would gnabry slot in well at chelsea? everything suggests so. he is versatile, clinical in the final third and along with sterling would give chelsea's attacking unit a totally different look. tuchel prefers to play without a target forward and sterling and gnabry could start underneath havertz, or one of them could even start up top with mason mount in the attacking midfield position. gnabry would give tuchel flexibility and the german coach loves that from his team. gnabry doesn't appear to be closer to agreeing a new contract at bayern munich and chelsea could take advantage of that situation. (jpw) how big of a priority is center back for chelsea? in a word, huge. after losing antonio rudiger to real madrid and andreas christensen to barcelona on free transfers, captain cesar azpilicueta could also be heading to barca and that leaves chelsea very short in defense. ake and koulibaly would be perfect fits for chelsea's --- system and koulibaly would be a very good direct replacement for antonio rudiger. koulibaly will be expensive but he does have just one year left on his contract at napoli and the -year-old may feel like now is the time to take his talents to the premier league after what seems like constant links in every single transfer window of the last five years. (jpw) chelsea have reached verbal agreement with chicago fire for gabriel slonina, after direct talks between todd boehly and mls club. m deal plus add-ons, he\'d stay at chicago on loan. :blue_circle: #cfc should chelsea cash in on kante now? they will likely get close to $ million for him if they sold him this summer and the french international struggled increasingly with injuries last season. when he's fit and firing on all cylinders there are still few defensive midfielders better than him in the world but it seems like thomas tuchel wants to freshen up his midfield options with jorginho also coming towards the end of his contract at stamford bridge and plenty of replacements, such as matheus nunes and frenkie de jong, have been linked with chelsea in recent weeks. (jpw) raheem sterling has agreed to join chelsea after seven seasons at manchester city, according to multiple reports. the -year-old england star would move with the world cup coming up, and the move could alter the club futures for fellow international stars christian pulisic, timo werner, and hakim ziyech. what would this transfer mean for chelsea? more details and analysis, here. (nm) a report from the athletic claims that chelsea chairman todd boehly has been in talks with jorge mendes about a potential deal for cristiano ronaldo. ronaldo, , has reportedly told united he wants to move on this summer and he did not turn up for the first day of preseason due to 'family reasons' as it appears his second spell at old trafford is coming to an abrupt end. per this report, chelsea are exploring if they could do a deal for ronaldo but there are apparently some hestitations from thomas tuchel about ronaldo being a good fit for the blues. would this work? firstly, it would be shocking if man united sold ronaldo to a direct top four rival in the premier league. why would they do that? ronaldo is under contract for another season so they would rather keep him against his will for one season rather than strengthen a rival. secondly, it's quite clear that ronaldo would score plenty of goals at chelsea but would his arrival upset the balance of the squad as it did at united? the second point is wading into muddy waters as chelsea have had success in bringing in a superstar veteran (thiago silva) and if ronaldo is willing to work with their talented youngsters, he will get plenty of chances to score. chelsea need a new no. after loaning out romelu lukaku and ronaldo wants to play in the champions league, which chelsea are in. on the face of it, this makes sense for everyone aside from manchester united. that is the big problem. (jpw) once a chelsea prospect, dutch defender nathan ake is wanted by thomas tuchel for the first team at stamford bridge. the -year-old ex-bournemouth star has not played as much as he'd like at manchester city but the premier league champions rate him much higher than the proposed chelsea bid. the blues are said to be willing to offer around $ million, about half of the reported city valuation. what fee would it take to get city to sell a player to a would-be title rival. if gabriel jesus moved to london for $ million, albeit with less time on his deal, perhaps that's nearer to the bullseye. (nm) full story this time around, lukaku scored goals in appearances (all competitions - in in the premier league), bringing his chelsea career total to goals. in total, chelsea have paid roughly $ million for lukaku. quick math says, $ million per goal. (ae) the todd boehly revolution is well underway at stamford bridge, where brazilian attacker raphinha is set to arrive from leeds united. it's a deal that could reach $ million, according to fabrizio romano, and certainly loads up jesse marsch's transfer kitty at leeds. this, of course, assumes that chelsea can come to an agreement on a contract with raphinha, who has also been linked with barcelona and arsenal. raphinha scored times with three assists for leeds last premier league season, a year after scoring six times and adding nine assists following a transfer from stade rennais. a report from the telegraph states that chelsea boss thomas tuchel has reached out directly to raheem sterling to discuss a possible move to stamford bridge this summer. the england international, , could well be surplus to requirements at manchester city next season and chelsea need to freshen up their attack. with romelu lukaku on his way to inter milan, hakim ziyech in talks over a loan move to ac milan and timo werner likely leaving too, it's clear that tuchel wants to rebalance his attack and sterling is one of his top targets. per the report, city value sterling at $- million and chelsea will now make a bid after tuchel spoke directly with the player. would this be a good move for both sterling and chelsea? probably. sterling has been a star at man city over the last seven seasons but he probably isn't appreciated as much as he should be and with erling haaland and julian alvarez arriving this summer at city, the speedy winger will face even stiffer competition for a starting spot. he struggled for minutes a little last season ( compared to in -) but his quality is clear for all to see. the way he stretches teams on the break and cuts inside would suit tuchel's --- system well, as sterling could play as the central striker or as one of the two underneath forwards. sterling has just one year left on his current contract at city and with gabriel jesus set to leave this summer for arsenal, are city going to allow both to move on? maybe. they have always been pretty good at letting players move on if they want to but pep guardiola may feel a little shorthanded if both sterling and jesus leave this summer. (jpw) per the report, ronaldo was discussed and chelsea are interested in seeing whether or not he can be temped to west london. given that he only has one year left on his contract and they'd be strengthening a direct top four rival, united would surely rather keep ronaldo than sell him to chelsea this summer. united have since briefed plenty of outlets, including our partners in the uk at sky sports, that ronaldo is not for sale and will not leave this summer. a report from our partners at sky italy states that hakim ziyech could head on loan to ac milan in a similar deal which will see romelu lukaku move to inter from chelsea. per the report, ziyech is keen on the move and he has been a target for ac milan for some time. the moroccan winger has never really settled at chelsea despite the odd sublime goal and stunning display. with tuchel looking to freshen up his attack this summer, ziyech, werner, lukaku and even christian pulisic appear to be surplus to requirements as tuchel expects plenty of new arrivals under the new ownership group led by chelsea chairman todd boehly. according to a separate report from the telegraph the blues boss expects up to six new players to arrive at stamford bridge this summer. with de ligt, raheem sterling, richarlison and ousmane dembele strongly linked with a move to chelsea, this is going to be a very different looking side, especially in attack. (jpw) a report from di marzio in italy suggests that timo werner plus $ million is the offer chelsea have put forward for juventus defender matthijs de ligt but the turin club want werner and closer to $ million. per the report both werner and de ligt are up for the move, with the dutch center back set to be the new center-piece of thomas tuchel's defense, while werner is keen for a fresh start in italy as his goalscoring woes in the premier league continue. would this be a good move for all parties? de ligt has been much better in recent seasons at juve but he has struggled at times and perhaps the premier league would suit his game slightly better. as for werner, well, he's beloved by the chelsea fans for his incredible effort in games but his finishing has really let him down and if he moves on now he can leave with his head held high. (jpw) juventus center back matthijs de ligt's $ million release clause and its expectation not to budge much from the price tag may not stop chelsea, according to sky sports. the blues are pursuing the -year-old dutch star, having lost antonio rudiger and andreas christensen this summer. chelsea has to address the crew of thiago silva, malang sarr, and trevoh chalobah. de ligt cost juventus about $ million from ajax. amongst defenders, only virgil van dijk, harry maguire, and lucas hernandez have cost more than de ligt's transfer fee then and only four players have cost more than his current release clause, which expires in . should it happen, this would be huge splash from new chairman todd boehly? (nm). richarlison can certainly do that and given his experience in the premier league and his tenacity and work-rate, he seems like a very good fit for tuchel's --- system at chelsea as he could play up top or in one of the two underneath positions. the transfer fee is going to be sizeable (probably $- million) but richarlison has been consistent at everton and there's reason to believe he will create and score plenty of goals in a team who are on the front-foot more often. (jpw) would this be a good move for chelsea, and sterling? it seems like a pretty good fit and if chelsea can drive down the price a little, they will go all-in for sterling. that said, city could be selling to potential title rivals so they will want a big transfer fee. sterling is not really and out-and-out winger and tuchel doesn't like to play with pure wingers in his --- system. he would be very good on the left of the two forwards underneath a central striker and he loves to cut inside and cause havoc. even though sterling gets a bad rep for missing big chances he has still scored goals in all competitions for man city over the last three seasons. that's goals per season and chelsea need someone what that production in their forward line as christian pulisic, timo werner and hakim ziyech have all struggled to stay fit and in-form. with erling haaland arriving this summer at city, sterling could well struggle for playing time this season at city and he has been in and out of the team over the last months. he could play centrally at chelsea, as the report suggests, and tuchel is said to be a big fan of sterling. add in all of that to the fact that sterling grew up in west london and his family connections are in the area and it all kind of makes sense, right? (jpw) if that move doesn't happen due to barca's financial situation, christensen will not be short of options. with the futures of cesar azpilicueta, marcos alonso, romelu lukaku and several other forwards (see below) uncertain, it is building up to be a very intriguing summer at chelsea. and, oh yeah, they also have new billionaire owners who are keen to make their mark. (jpw) was he really underutilized last season, and is the same true for werner? or ziyech? or lukaku? we take a deeper dive here (nm). psv eindhoven midfielder ibrahim sangare has been linked with manchester united and chelsea in reports that say the combative midfielder plans to be in the premier league next season. sangare, , has a $ million release clause and three years left on his psv contract, having moved from then-ligue side toulouse at the start of - season. he registered the third-most tackles in eredivisie last season with and the third-most interceptions with , chipping in three goals while passing the ball at nearly percent.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

season but coming up short at the business end of the campaign, there is an extremely good squad already assembled and arsenal will be in the uefa champions league next season. that means extra experience and quality will be needed. arteta continues to rejuvenate an already stunning attack that includes gabriel jesus, bukayo saka, gabriel martinelli and captain martin odegaard, but it is perhaps in midfield and defense where he will look to do business this summer. below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on arsenal transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. rice has long been linked with a move to arsenal or manchester united but it is believed that west ham's asking price for their captain and central midfielder (who is out of contract next summer) is putting up premier league clubs. bayern appear to be ready to pay close to the $ million west ham want for rice. is he worth it? he is. there is perhaps no better two-way central midfielder under the age of in europe and rice's ceiling is extremely high. (jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low. (nm) de zerbi: ""caicedo is a good guy. we will see. we hope he stays with us but this question for the club and moises"":police_car_light: #bhafc #afc excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right? (jpw) :police_car_light: exclusive: chelsea board now in poland trying to reach verbal agreement with shakhtar for mudryk and hijack the deal! official bid ready close to EURm. :blue_circle: #cfc arsenal always been leading the race, in talks with shakhtar after d official bid. according to the latest report regarding arsenal's pursuit of mykhaylo mudryk, progress is being made as arsenal and shakhtar donetsk go back and forth over the transfer fee. $ million is the latest reported base fee, with another $ million expected in add-ons. (ae) the latest reports on mykhaylo mudryk to arsenal have arrived and although the gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the ukraine international winger has flown to turkey and gone on tour with them. shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and mudryk, , has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. he is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent. that said, a report from the daily express suggests that shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $ million and some compromises are being found. this all hinges on how much arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. the structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team. (nm) ins leandro trossard - brighton & hove albion ($. million) jorginho - chelsea ($. million) jakub kiwior - spezia (undisclosed) outs brooke norton-cuffy (coventry) loan miguel azeez (wigan) loan arthur okonkwo (sturm graz) loan ovie ejeheri (sjk seinajoki) loan harry clarke (ipswich town) jorginho has joined arsenal on an -month contract, for a reported fee of $. million. the -year-old italian, who started of premier league games for chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for mikel arteta, as the gunners try to lift the pl trophy for the first time since . brighton wasn't lying when it came to their desire to keep moises caicedo for a european push, and arsenal has made a new plan. sure some arsenal fans won't love buying a player off of chelsea, but jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. the risk is low. (nm) de zerbi: ""caicedo is a good guy. we will see. we hope he stays with us but this question for the club and moises"":police_car_light: #bhafc #afc excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

(ae) the latest reports on mykhaylo mudryk to arsenal have arrived and although the gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the ukraine international winger has flown to turkey and gone on tour with them. shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and mudryk, , has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. he is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent. that said, a report from the daily express suggests that shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $ million and some compromises are being found. this all hinges on how much arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. the structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially. (jpw) leeds are exploring new options for the midfield including weston mckennie. it's one of the possibilities considered by the club as @mattemoretto has reported  #lufc a member of poland's world cup team, kiwior had been with spezia since the start of the - season. the left-footed center back has nine caps for poland and started all four of the club's matches at the world cup. kiwior turns next month and will wear no. . a fee has not been disclosed. :speech_balloon: ""it's huge for me that arsenal were interested and that i'm able to be here."" we\'re so happy to have you here, jakub :raising_hands: according to a report from gazzetta dello sport, usmnt midfielder weston mckennie is wanted by arsenal. per the report, arsenal are in talks with juve and are willing to spend around $- million on mckennie. the american midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the italian giants were just handed a -point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. the report says mckennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. mckennie has long been linked with tottenham, and other pl clubs, but this move to arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for xhaka and partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (jpw) arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (nm) this is absolutely bonkers. there have been reports over the last week or so that chelsea could make a move for mudryk but this latest update from fabrizio romano seems to be a lot more concrete and chelsea are trying to get one over their london rivals. arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with shakhtar and it seems like chelsea are ready to pay the ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. this would be a huge blow for arsenal but i guess every player has his price, right?

" tottenham hotspur are the subject of a $.bn takeover bid from an iranian-american billionaire a tottenham hotspur takeover could be on the horizon, with the lilywhites the subject of a ""blockbuster"" bid. the majority of tottenham hotspur fc is currently owned by enic group, who purchased the club in . joe lewis currently holds .% of the total issued share capital, with club chairman - and public face of the board - daniel levy and his family owning .% of the share capital. now, however, iranian-american billionaire jahm najafi is preparing what the financial times (opens in new tab) describes as a $.bn takeover bid for the club, ""according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans"".

"julien laurens explains why there was only one choice for espn fc\'s top u star. (:) the world\'s best male players are getting younger, but is it finally time to crown successors to the legendary lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo? for the fifth straight year (read , , and here), espn brings you our list of the game\'s next top young stars aged or under. now , last year\'s no. erling haaland is too old to be included, while some others from \'s top -- phil foden, vinicius junior and alphonso davies -- are also over the age requirement, too. many of this year\'s crop have made their mark on the big stage already, but who has done enough to land a place on espn\'s list, what are their particular qualities and how can they get even better? collating the list for the fourth year running is tor-kristian karlsen, who has worked as a scout and executive for clubs across europe, including monaco, zenit and watford. he explains his methodology before revealing his picks. - stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga, more (u.s.) why ? what types of research were undertaken? i used a sounding board consisting of professional scouts and sporting directors from several top european clubs before deciding on the final ranking, as well as some online scouting platforms. personal preference also played a role. is there a reason that attacking players dominate the list? in general, forwards get more playing time at a younger age than, say, central defenders, who tend to need more time to develop tactical awareness, positioning and understanding of the game. beyond those who did make it, other defenders considered included benfica\'s antonio silva, atalanta\'s giorgio scalvini and soon-to-be tottenham full-back destiny udogie. it speaks volumes about the array of attacking talent that players such as rb leipzig\'s benjamin sesko, arsenal\'s folarin balogun, leeds united\'s wilfried gnonto, newcastle\'s anthony gordon, and -year-old palmeiras prodigy endrick (who is to join real madrid in for EUR million) didn\'t make the final cut. notes: - transfer values are taken from transfermarkt. - positions are: gk (goalkeeper), lb (left-back), rb (right-back), cb (centre-back), dm (defensive midfield), cm (central midfield), am (attacking midfield), fw (forward), st (striker.) club/country: sporting cp/uruguay age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: his career offers some clues about ugarte\'s mentality: he\'s determined, hard-working and focused on improving the weaker aspects of his game. an irrepressible ball winner, he attempts a stunning seven tackles per minutes (at a success rate of %) and swiftly looks to press opponents and close gaps. technically he\'s a master of the basics with tidy control, a solid short-to-long passing range and an absence of anything flashy. he is intelligent, often finding the right option after regaining possession, and plays to his strengths. how he can improve: despite not being a natural playmaker, his passing in the face of a low block from the opposition can be on the predictable side. as a by-product of his tenacity, his frequent fouling (. fouls per minutes) leads to numerous bookings and he will need to curb that to avoid suspension. club/country: borussia dortmund/united states age: estimated transfer value: EURm three years on from making his bundesliga debut at the age of , many would have expected the american to be further down the line in terms of development. while injuries have played their part, lack of confidence and controversies over his standing for the usmnt may also explain reyna\'s start-stop career trajectory. how he can improve: while reyna\'s skill set hasn\'t evaporated, what was previously demonstrated on a weekly basis now tends only come in moments. the daring dribbles in the final third and sharp combination play that set him apart early in his career are yet to fully return. whether it requires a lift in energy, attitude or self-belief, reyna must regain the trust of his club head coach, edin terzic. club/country: borussia monchengladbach/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: usually fielded as the more defensive-minded midfielder in a double pivot, kone provides balance in the centre of the pitch. with his athleticism, work rate and discipline, he covers large areas, presses and protects his centre-backs. in possession, he is adept at advancing with the ball with both speed and dexterity. hard to dispossess, he is also nimble and able to successfully negotiate his way out of congested areas. how he can improve: kone is not a playmaker, but his passing can appear overly cautious. his aggressive style and full-bodied commitment also leads to unnecessary frequent bookings. club/country: liverpool/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: energetic, lively and light-footed, the england u international presses with intent and opens up space with his movement. on the ball he adds to the fluidity of the game by way of instinctive touches, directness in his passing and excellent dribbling abilities. his left foot -- though underused from set-pieces and long-distance shooting -- is of a high standard, too. how he can improve: in addition to his inconsistent defensive contribution and his physical shortcomings in terms of strength and height, elliott should be attempting to beat opponents in central areas to a higher degree -- especially since he\'s so good at it. given his creativity and intelligence, one expects a higher input than his five goals and two assists from games this season. club/country: valencia/united states age: estimated transfer value: EURm a key player for the usmnt at the world cup, musah has lacked consistency in a struggling valencia side in laliga. on the whole, though, he\'s making progress: his playing time has been increasing and he recently put in one of his best performances of the season in a - home win against osasuna. how he can improve: being such an influential, progressive and active midfielder -- especially from his central position -- upping his attacking game would add another dimension, as he has yet to score in laliga this season. club/country: lyon/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm the prodigal talent is experiencing his best run of form after breaking into the lyon first team two years ago. now, under laurent blanc\'s stewardship, cherki tends to stay on the pitch for the duration of matches and has added maturity and consistency to his game. strengths: technically superb with an array of footwork trickery, quick turns and body feints, cherki has often been considered a player who can only express his skills in the final third. but this season there\'s a lot more end product to his game: he releases the ball to teammates quicker, his passing game has become more progressive and, with some extra muscle, appears harder to knock of the ball. equally skilled with either foot, the playmaker (who manages . key passes per minutes) can create things in any role behind the centre-forward. club/country: nottingham forest/wales age: estimated transfer value: EURm despite a slow start to his premier league career, the wales international is starting to answer his critics who doubted whether he\'d be able to cut it at the highest level. while he initially struggled to get to grips with higher tactical demands and better defenders in the top flight, his upturn in performances for forest has been impressive. strengths: with an outstanding ability to run with the ball at high speed, johnson thrives in transition or when the game opens up. regardless of his position wide right or as a central attacker, he prefers to drift and exploit the space between opposing centre-back and full-back. though he is naturally right-footed, he is able to take on opponents with both feet and finish with power. how he can improve: johnson can opt for an individual move instead of taking an extra second to look for a better-placed teammate. in his enthusiasm to get things done quickly, the precision in his short passing and lay-offs also suffers. club/country: borussia dortmund/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: his goal against chelsea in the champions league showcased his strong points: pace, dribbling and skill in one-vs.-one situations. breaking from a defensive corner, adeyemi set off on a run from the edge of his own box, picked up the ball with meters left to cover before bursting past enzo fernandez with a quick change of pace and playing the ball calmly behind an outmanoeuvred kepa in the chelsea goal. in addition to the acceleration, effortless running style and fine technical ability, adeyemi is also an instinctive finisher -- especially with his left foot -- with a penchant for improvisation (as proven a couple of days later with his backheeled opener against hertha berlin.) how he can improve: at times his tremendous pace can come at the expense of ball control. his insistence on taking on opponents, even when the situation calls for a supportive pass, can force him into blind alleys and he can lose possession. club/country: villarreal/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm last season, yeremy provided memorable moments aplenty and was rewarded with his first senior spain cap. this campaign has been a slower start and while he might struggle to match last term\'s six-goal haul (he has three at the time of writing), he\'s shown himself to be a big-game player by getting on the scoresheet in the wins against real madrid and atletico. strengths: alternating between starting positions on either wing, the quick and nimble forward is capable of providing width in attack or setting off on rapid diagonal runs towards central areas. in addition to possessing fine attributes for a winger -- excellent dribbling skills, acceleration from a standing position, innate interchanges and smart runs -- yeremy also has the vision to put in penetrative passes through the middle. he doesn\'t go to sleep when out of possession either; he is committed to his pressing and, despite his -foot- frame, is surprisingly strong in aerial duels. how he can improve: in short, he needs to score more goals. considering his mobility and intelligence, he could sharpen his attacking involvement, as he can be prone to drift in and out of games. julien laurens explains why there was only one choice for espn fc\'s top u star. club/country: manchester city/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: a polished, well-schooled academy product, lewis is neat on the ball, dribbles well and has the composure and intelligence to respond to guardiola\'s tactical demands. his agility on the ball also means he can shift inside to feature in midfield, take part in swift one-touch combinations and find space in areas other than down the touchline. how he can improve: while his pace often comes to his rescue, lewis\' decision-making and incisiveness in defensive one-on-ones are areas to work on. adding more aggression to his game would also be a good idea. club/country: borussia dortmund/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm moukoko\'s early career has not taken off in the way that was predicted following his incredible goal tally at youth level and his record-breaking entry to the borussia dortmund first team at the age of . however, the germany international has seen increased playing time this campaign (initially because of sebastien haller\'s illness) with six goals in bundesliga games so far. strengths: predominantly recognised for his spectacular left-footed shot (his first goal against bochum was a goal of the season candidate) which made him so prolific at youth level, moukoko is a fast, penetrative forward with sharp off-the-ball movement. he comes to life when turning his marker and entering the final third, where he can bear down on goal and test the goalkeeper. club/country: ac milan/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: despite standing at -foot-, thiaw is elegant, moves with ease and exudes a calm authority uncommon for a young centre-back. along with good timing and interception skills, he is particularly dominant in the air (having won nearly % of his challenges since the turn of the year) and stays alert for clearances and crucial tackles. when playing out from the back, he avoids risks and his long passes are of high quality. how he can improve: unsurprisingly for a -year-old defender, there have been lapses of concentration in both the passing and man-marking departments, as illustrated in the recent away defeats at fiorentina and udinese. club/country: aston villa/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm the villa academy graduate -- now playing under his third head coach -- has established himself as an integral part of the first xi. his upward trajectory means that a senior england call-up should be a viable short-term goal for the u international. strengths: adapting to a more attacking role (further wide, but with the licence to cut inside) under manager unai emery, ramsey has been given the freedom to use his incredible spatial awareness in attacking areas. full of energy and enthusiasm, the dynamic midfielder is among the best dribblers in the premier league. he times his runs into the box well, is a fine finisher and doesn\'t shirk his defensive duties to help regain possession. how he can improve: ramsey needs to learn how to dial back the pace a little to add more patience, imagination and precision to his passing game. club/country: psv eindhoven/netherlands age: estimated transfer value: EURm in his first season as a regular, the barcelona academy graduate has treated the psv fans to some displays of individual quality. having left psg in the summer -- ostensibly because of limited game time -- the french giants may regret not hanging on to the midfielder, who plays with childlike joy when he is on the pitch. strengths: because of his roaming nature, simons operates with ease in any attacking formation. he has the nous to find space between the lines, a low centre of gravity and sublime ball control that makes him hard to dispossess. in a martin odegaard-esque manner, he picks out teammates with perfectly weighted passes (. chances created per minutes), even in crowded areas. not to mention there\'s end product too; his goals -- varying from flamboyant chips and well-timed runs off the shoulders of defenders to curled efforts from the edge of the box -- have placed him at joint top of the eredivisie goal-scoring charts. how he can improve: his playfulness can lead to him losing the ball too much, while he could make even more use of his left foot. club/country: everton/belgium age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: courtesy of his excellent work rate, the - onana provides a persistent, reliable enforcing presence in midfield. his size doesn\'t restrict his mobility as he enters duels (an average of nine attacking challenges per minutes) and presses with high intensity. just as his frequent ball recoveries, aerial dominance and tackling alleviate the pressure on everton\'s defence, onana is also hard to dispossess -- especially when he sets off on a forward burst with the ball. club/country: celta vigo/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm veiga is the breakout story in laliga this season, helping celta vigo climb up the table. the midfielder\'s rapid rise -- he had only started one league match prior to this season -- has sparked interest from several top premier league sides and also real madrid and barcelona. strengths: predominantly a roaming no. , veiga has all the qualities to become a top performer in the role. not only is he exceptionally good at finding the right attacking spaces, but he also exhibits the confidence, precision and technique to hit the target from the edge of the box, which has seen him score nine laliga goals this season. his forceful drives forward are an essential aspect for a player in his role, while he breaks through the opposing lines with his passes and provides passing options for his own teammates. veiga\'s willingness to work hard defensively and smart off-the-ball positioning to regain possession add another dimension to his game. how he can improve: with even more sharpness and accuracy from his passing in the final third, veiga could become a frequent assist provider. club/country: manchester united/argentina age: estimated transfer value: EURm garnacho has been one of the beneficiaries of new man united manager erik ten hag\'s youth-focused leadership and, although he tends to be used as an impact substitute, there\'s little doubt that the argentina international is held in high esteem by his head coach. as well as scoring two premier league goals, he has also made an impact in the europa league and domestic cup competitions. strengths: usually deployed as a left winger, garnacho can turn the dynamics of a game through mesmerising, intuitive dribbles. his outstanding balance, coordination, burst of acceleration and ability to take on defenders on either side make him hard to read. he draws defenders to him, helping create space for his teammates, while his confidence in the first-team environment has grown. how he can improve: often too selfish in possession, his decision-making needs work. his off-the-ball movement is becoming less predictable, but some added upper-body strength would make him even more effective. club/country: bayern munich/netherlands age: estimated transfer value: EURm once considered one of the best young talents in european football, the midfielder has had a frustrating time since moving to bayern munich from ajax for EURm last summer. playing time has been scarce -- he has only started one bundesliga match -- and when coming on from the bench, he has generally been unable to make the desired impact. gravenberch hasn\'t hidden his discontent, which in turn has triggered speculation about his long-term future at the club. strengths: at his best, the netherlands international -- who was recently demoted to the u side -- is a technically superb, agile and intelligent central midfielder. equally able to play as a holding midfielder or as a no. , gravenberch can dictate the flow of the game by dropping deep to pick up the ball and distribute it with well-angled passes. at -foot-, he pairs excellent coordination with the ability to seamlessly glide past opponents without losing the ball. though more prevalent from his ajax days, gravenberch\'s shooting skills are also of a high standard. how he can improve: the key for gravenberch to reverse his fortunes at bayern is likely to come down to his mental toughness and ability to overcome adversity. in the short term, it\'s a matter of asserting himself when given the chance or, if that fails, kick-start his career under the guidance of a coaching team prepared to make him an integral part of their midfield. club/country: southampton/belgium age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: typically lined up as one of two deep midfielders, lavia is charged with the less glamorous tasks of the role. powerful, mobile and disciplined, he closes down space, regains possession, offers receiving options, covers sizable areas and hassles opponents. moreover, the teenager conducts himself with an aura of authority that belies his age. equipped with a fine close control and balance to shield the ball, lavia rarely gives away possession. how he can improve: the former anderlecht prospect could add another dimension to his game by taking more risks in his passing -- though easier said than done in a struggling side. club/country: chelsea/brazil age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: with great energy, strength and high levels of technical ability, the -year-old can successfully be deployed as a no. defensive midfielder or as a roaming box-to-box midfielder. in fact, his vigorous style makes him more suited to the latter as he is brilliant at driving forward with the ball and timing his runs into the box. most of his goals originate from picking up rebounds and reading where the ball will drop in the final third. how he can improve: the premier league\'s intensity means he will have less time on the ball. he will need to adapt to its physicality, too. club/country: bayer leverkusen/ecuador age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: proactive, confident, quick and technically proficient, hincapie is well suited to a team wanting to dominate possession and defend high up the pitch. slotting in on the left of a back three, he enjoys the freedom to push forward to create numerical advantage in midfield and possesses the touch, vision and passing skills to add an attacking x-factor. his steady progression has included more interceptions and more tackles won, and he is now being trusted more on the ball. how he can improve: his aggressive style of defending does result in excessive fouling -- he has two red cards this campaign -- just as his high-risk style of defending high up the pitch occasionally puts his teammates in trouble. club/country: atalanta/denmark age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: at first glance it\'s tempting to expect the -foot- striker to operate like an out-and-out centre-forward. however, he thrives when setting off on deep, incisive runs against high defensive lines and can also be fielded from a position out wide on the right. combining his impressive physique and lightning pace (according to his head coach, gian piero gasperini, he completes a -meter sprint in less than seconds) with smart, varied movement and a powerful left-footed shot, hojlund is stylistically similar to young man city striker erling haaland. how he can improve: with added composure in front of goal, a more focused hold-up game (he has around nine ball losses per minutes) and better timing with his headers (he wins just % of his aerial duels), hojlund could develop into a top-level forward. club/country: athletic club/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm williams has elevated himself from impact substitute to key player in the athletic side. to underline his sharp development, the winger has earned a spot with the senior spain team and made four appearances at the world cup. strengths: williams has impressive upper-body strength, good balance and an electric turn of pace. combined with instinctive control and an ability to time his runs well, he is an unpredictable winger who can be hard to defend against. his capacity to turn, dribble, shoot and finish with either foot (he\'s naturally right-footed) makes him adept at tormenting full-backs on either side of the pitch, often cutting infield to create havoc. how he can improve: williams has to up his efficiency in defensive challenges (only a % success rate), while the quality of his crossing also leaves something to be desired. club/country: chelsea/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: physically imposing and comfortable on the ball, badiashile looks every inch the modern centre-back. though he can walk a tightrope with the excessive confidence he displays when bringing the ball out of the defence, the france international has toned down his risk-taking for a more safety-first approach. badiashile reads the game exceptionally well, deals assertively with challenges and transmits confidence across the back line. how he can improve: badiashile needs to show more of what we saw from his monaco days: evading opposing pressure and playing the first, incisive pass out of defence. club/country: benfica/portugal age: estimated transfer value: EURm ramos took cristiano ronaldo\'s starting spot for portugal against switzerland at the world cup, scored a hat trick and has gone from strength to strength since. his goal scoring in the portuguese league, with over this season, has firmly placed him among the best young centre-forwards in the game and he will surely become benfica\'s next high-profile export. how he can improve: in addition to being occasionally sloppy with flicks and lay-offs in the final third, ramos could -- as much as it may sound unfair given his impressive numbers -- up his scoring efficiency even more (he takes nearly three shots per minutes now.) age: estimated transfer value: EURm in his second season at psg, mendes has confirmed his status as one of the top young full-backs in world football. though injuries have proved disruptive both for himself (his world cup with portugal was cut short for that reason) and psg coach christophe galtier, he is still one of the most consistent members of the squad. strengths: whether fielded as a left-back in a back four or as a wing-back in a -- formation, mendes is a force to be reckoned with down the left side. providing an outlet for switches of play, he is exceptionally skilled at taking on opponents through rapid turns of direction and his -plus touches inside the opposing penalty area per minutes speak volumes of his desire to join the attack. he has built a fine understanding with kylian mbappe and is also a tenacious defender who comes out on top in % of his defensive duels. how he can improve: though mendes is a fine crosser of the ball, his efficiency (%) could improve. however, this isn\'t necessarily all down to him -- it\'s also the job of his teammates to get on the end of the crosses. club/country: ajax amsterdam/netherlands age: estimated transfer value: EURm having been linked with a big transfer for the past year or so, one may have expected timber to have departed ajax by now, especially since half the side that fared so well in the champions league last season have secured lucrative moves themselves. the highly rated central defender, who can also play at right-back, is still on the watchlist of the elite clubs in europe amid another fine season. strengths: timber has most of the attributes required for a modern centre-back. safe in possession -- a passing accuracy of % (per minutes) is impressive for a defender who likes to build from the back -- his close control allows him to draw opposing pressure from which he can escape with a neat touch or dash of acceleration if options to pass are lacking. his lightning pace makes him well suited to playing a high line in defence, while his anticipation enables him to get his body in front of opponents and time his tackles well. how he can improve: being relatively short for a defender at - impacts his aerial efficiency (% of duels won), so he may be best suited to a club that plays a back three (as he lines up for netherlands.) club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm one of the most naturally gifted talents of his generation, ansu is striving to return to the spectacular form that saw him burst onto the scene with barcelona at the age of . whether still compromised by the knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year, burdened by the expectations that come with his reputation, affected by a lack of minutes or simply going through the natural ups and downs of a young player, he is still yet to reach his full potential. how he can improve: staying injury-free and finding more consistency at the highest level is key. but a loan move to an environment away from the demanding camp nou could see ansu obtain the required playing time to kick-start his career. club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm it has been an incredible journey for balde: from barcelona\'s la masia academy and the b team to becoming the first-choice senior left-back and a full spain international in less than a year. the emergence of such a wonderful prospect who has adapted so quickly to the highest level is a dream come true for financially stricken barcelona. strengths: balde possesses most of the qualities you want from a young full-back. he times his runs well, his positioning when playing out from the back is improving and when entering the final third, his one-on-one skills and quick interchanges with teammates are excellent. while he often relies on his pace to deal with defensive situations, his reading of the game is getting better and, as an attacking force, he is a danger in wide areas as well as when he cuts inside. how he can improve: he needs a higher degree of focus to track opponents\' runs off his shoulder and could be more attentive in his marking inside the box. his crossing could also be more varied. espn fc analysts give their take on the top best players under in world football. club/country: brighton & hove albion/ecuador age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: covering large areas of the pitch with ease, caicedo is alert to the dynamics of the game and can make a big impact when he steps up. in addition to his remarkable consistency, endurance and presence on the pitch, he tackles with precision, presses diligently and continuously scans for interceptions and loose balls. though a natural in his defensive duties, he is capable of carrying the ball forward, linking well with the left full-back and finding space to take advantage of rebounds to fire off shots from the edge of the box. how he can improve: caicedo almost unfailingly plays to his maximum capacity every game, yet he has the quality and vision to take more risks with his passing in the final third. club/country: rb leipzig/croatia age: estimated transfer value: EURm the croatia defender hardly put a foot wrong at the world cup -- at least until he encountered argentina\'s lionel messi in full flow -- and he has made a big impact in the champions league for his club, getting on the scoresheet and standing out against real madrid and manchester city (in the first leg). while he is contracted at leipzig for another four years, gvardiol is attracting interest from the biggest clubs in europe. strengths: gvardiol is blessed with excellent pace, balance and physical robustness that makes him efficient in defensive one-on-ones. he has a great left foot, with fine close control, and is comfortable spraying medium- and long-range passes out of defence with accuracy. at , he operates with the confidence of a defender years his senior. how he can improve: he needs to pay more attention when tracking opponents on crosses and in high-intensity defensive situations. his sporadic lack of focus was highlighted in the - champions league defeat at manchester city, though that was down to a collective collapse rather than any one individual. club/country: bayer leverkusen/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm following a nine-month injury absence because of a ruptured cruciate ligament, wirtz has managed to get himself back to the level he was at before disaster struck. alongside no. on this list, wirtz is arguably the most talented german prospect of his generation and has made a huge impact for leverkusen, both domestically and in europe. strengths: one of the most complete attacking midfielders in european football, wirtz -- who is equally dominant in a central position behind the striker, cutting in from the left or even as a false nine up front -- is excellent at gaining space with his wonderful dribbling abilities. not only is he capable of beating opponents from a standing position, he also does something clinical afterwards, with cleverly executed passes, well-engineered combinations or shots on target. in addition to being a technically gifted playmaker, wirtz\'s avid pressing helps him win the ball back. how he can improve: staying clear of injury will be key in his development but he needs to target double figures in goals and assists next season. making a consistent impact on games throughout the minutes will ensure he steps up to the next level. club/country: arsenal/brazil age: estimated transfer value: EURm not only has the brazilian forward been a major contributor in arsenal\'s spectacular premier league season, but he has also been one of the most improved players in european football. aided by more fluency in the team\'s attack and compatible players around him, martinelli\'s confidence has skyrocketed and he has polished the rougher sides of his game. strengths: with his explosive pace, excellent balance and unpredictable off-the-ball movement, martinelli poses a constant threat to opposition defences. over the course of the year, he has sharpened his skills, adding another level of precision which has seen him make . key passes per minutes. on the evidence of his premier league goals from position on the left wing -- often by way of late, well-timed runs and one-touch finishes with either foot -- he possesses superb timing and appreciation of space. his ever-present intensity helps in the press, and his work rate and eagerness to learn is high. how he can improve: martinelli could stand to improve the accuracy of his short passes, combination touches and lay-offs, and he can also be liable to lose momentum or run out of ideas when facing a wall of defenders. club/country: real madrid/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: calm in possession and comfortable on the ball, camavinga performs his deeper role in midfield expertly. he drops back to collect the ball from his centre-backs and actively roams in space to provide a passing outlet for his full-backs. when distributing from defence with his left foot, he demonstrates impressive accuracy in all facets of his passing, while he\'s often the initiator of moves that end in goal-scoring opportunities. versatile enough to operate as a no. , too, he can break opposition lines with a rapid burst of pace, presses with intent and reads the game well in order to pick up loose balls. how he can improve: given his skill set, there\'s no reason why camavinga shouldn\'t develop into one of the top midfield playmakers around. more variety in his range of passing could help; however, he is on record saying: ""i would only change my right foot: it\'s very bad."" club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: to find such a high level of technical, physical and mental attributes wrapped up in an -year-old midfielder is nothing short of awe-inspiring. his classy touch, combined with fabulous spatial awareness, cognitive sharpness and remarkable command of his body (when he sends opponents the wrong way when receiving the ball on the half-turn), are most commonly associated with flair players like neymar or ronaldinho. yet gavi backs that up with an unyielding desire to get on the ball and an unwavering determination to win it back. his competitive nature really stands out and, regardless of where he lines up tactically, his input is unquestionable and his energy contagious. weaknesses: while he is super competitive -- he was involved in more fouls for and against () than any other player at the world cup -- his decision-making around tackles still needs work. club/country: bayern munich/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: a technical star on the ball, musiala applies himself with maturity and is quick at reverting to pressing mode when his team lose possession. there are few unnecessary touches or flashy moments; instead, he aids the team\'s attacking flow with constructive, progressive involvements, illustrated by his admirable judgement of when and where to make use of his wonderful dribbling skills (% successful dribbles per minutes.) on top of his brilliant control, playmaking capabilities and linking of midfield and attack through his passing, he brings the end product too. with goals this season, making him bayern\'s leading scorer in the bundesliga, musiala exudes calmness in his finishing and, even at speed, ensures he scans the play before deciding on the best course of action. how he can improve: with a versatile skill set in both attack and defence, perfectly made for the modern game, musiala has few shortcomings. however, he has a slight tendency for his influence to drop towards the latter stages, so completing more games to the full minutes will be beneficial in his development. club/country: arsenal/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: saka thrives when he finds space wide on the right as his fine command of either foot gives him the option to either proceed at high speed for a quick one-two combination or advance on the outside of the marker to put in a cross or shot. adept at picking up the ball on the move and carrying it with pace, he has increased the intensity of arsenal\'s attacks and disrupts opponents\' defensive organisation. how he can improve: there are moments when he goes missing and fails to impose himself on a game which, in fairness, is not unusual for such a young player. saka can improve his defensive contributions, yet he is already winning more challenges in every area of the pitch and is showing more alertness to his pressing duties. club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: though he already has the profile of a complete central attacking midfielder, the former las palmas star\'s skill set goes off the charts when it comes to technical ability, receiving and distributing the ball. in addition to his passing range -- instinctive, penetrative, needing few touches and on the half-turn -- is an extraordinary awareness to pick the right space with consistency. arguably best in an offensive no. role, pedri glues the attack together with his rhythmic interchanges. he demands the ball in the most advantageous areas before moving it on with precision to a teammate. off the ball, his exceptional spatial awareness and timing of runs sees him get on the end of attacks with one-touch finishes or quick combinations to create a chance. what makes pedri even more special is that he\'s a team player: he presses with diligence and recovers the ball three times per game on average. how he can improve: performing consistently at the upper limits of what can be expected of a -year-old, he does have one area of improvement -- becoming more robust in physical duels. club/country: borussia dortmund/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm the england international features an exceptional array of physical, technical and mental attributes, and as the perfect box-to-box midfielder -- with the versatility to feature deeper or higher up the pitch as a starting position -- he is a generational talent. strengths: where do you start? equipped with athleticism, stamina and close control, bellingham is outstanding on the ball (nearly three progressive carries and six dribbles per minutes.) once a defensive line has been broken, he\'s an accurate passer too and is able to create chances with precise touches and impressive vision. from deeper positions, he spreads the play routinely and picks out the attacking runs of his teammates early. as seen at the world cup with england, bellingham is strong in the air and, when arriving in the box, displays composure in front of goal. for all the technical and tactical mastery, it can be overlooked that he is both meticulous and proficient in his defensive game too. from an impressive challenges per minutes in the bundesliga, he comes out on top at a rate of %. how he can improve: though it speaks volumes about his confidence and willingness to take responsibility, his inclination to take lots of shots on goal does lead to his accuracy being slightly on the low side (%).'}",piero

" hello and welcome to another edition of our transfer newsletter, brought exclusively to you. below, i bring you the latest news from across the globe. man united are one of a number of top clubs that look set to be busy in the transfer window senior manchester united staff have checked on napoli's victor osimhen and dusan vlahovic of juventus in recent weeks. vlahovic, who has scored goals this season, would be cheaper, around PSm, while osimhen would cost PSm. both are on chelsea's list too. united have long held interest in vlahovic. they made a raft of detailed reports on the -year-old serbian prior to him leaving fiorentina, when arsenal also made their play, but the ft ins striker wanted juventus. for all their groundwork, united's bidding plans are stymied by ongoing takeover talks. manchester united have put in the groundwork for dusan vlahovic (left) and victor osimhen (right) ahead of a potential move this summer as they look to bring in a ready-made striker how vlahovic and osimhen compare statistically this year - figures courtesy of sofascore they will look at a new contract for the returning amad diallo, following his loan at sunderland, and for facundo pellistri. they want to find a similar level loan for the young uruguayan to gain competitive game time next season. united have yet to open talks with lisandro martinez over a new deal. the -year-old, currently recovering from a fractured metatarsal, has been back in argentina after being given permission to return home for a week and is in the running to be voted the club's player of the year. after clutching thin air for harry kane's free-kick, the -year-old recomposed himself to give a more than competent display at tottenham on saturday. afterwards, brentford boss thomas frank was, typically, frank, that the price on his goalkeeper's head was PSmillion. 'absolutely, it's realistic,' said frank. yet, with one year left on contract, tottenham consider PSm the more realistic price, cue some interesting negotiations. raya, who is also admired by chelsea, is understood to favour tottenham with hugo lloris considering an offer from al hilal in saudi arabia. brentford have lined up dutch keeper mark flekken of wolfsburg for around PSm, after considering

goals for reading's youth sides and england us. he had a spell training with west ham earlier this year and also had interest from brighton. however, city are favoured to win the race for the

" everyone seemed to have worked through the same inner turmoil. they had thought about not going. i mean, what was the point? not a chance. surely better to stay away and sack it off. but most of them found a reason. they'd promised the kids or were meeting a mate or, this being south yorkshire, they'd paid for the ticket and were determined to use the bloody thing. all these feelings laced in with the usual blind devotion. i mean, you never know, do you? you just never know, so they came in their thousands to see it through with gallows humour at the ready. brace for the worst and hope for the best and, every so often, comes reward like this, a night when west ham reached a european final, newcastle closed in on the champions league and jose mourinho continued his personal renaissance and yet the only place to be was watching third tier football in sheffield s. only hours earlier, manchester city had filleted real madrid with panache and precision to spark a debate about whether pep guardiola's team might be the greatest we have seen on these shores. this at hillsborough was nothing like that. it was, in fact, akin to a different code of the same sport. sheffield wednesday staged one of the biggest comebacks in efl history on thursday night they overcame a four goal deficit to defeat peterbrough in the league one play-off semi-final although no less thrilling for a lesser degree of technical excellence with possession rarely secure as the contest ricocheted wildly and physical contact undiluted by the all-seeing-eyes in the var bunker. sheffield wednesday boss darren moore is a coach accused in the past of trying to achieve a brand of football too pure, but he had to overturn a - deficit from the first leg of the league one play-off semi-final against peterborough united. so he packed his team with aerial power, launched it long and went direct, winning set-pieces while relying on the expert delivery from barry bannan and marvin johnson. he would have known an early goal would rev up the atmosphere and might unsettle peterborough who like to play it out from the back. and it did. the place shook as the goals went in. as some wednesday supporters surrendered to the euphoric urge to invade the pitch after winning the shootout and others filed out of hillsborough happily predicting certain defeat in the final at wembley, bannan interrupted moore's post-match speech in the dressing room to say a few words of his own. in a clip shared on social media, the captain wanted to thank moore, who had been a target for racist abuse after losing the first leg, and his coaching staff on behalf of the players for picking them up off the floor and restoring belief. for showing them footage of great footballing fightbacks in the team meetings. for laying out the statistics to prove they were scoring an average of three a game at home, so to overcome the deficit did not require an illogical leap. for insisting upon long, intense penalty practice sessions every day with speakers pumping out noise to replicate some of the stress they could expect. bannan didn't say this, but he might have also thanked his gaffer for having the courage to produce a strategy that went against his true principles. they would all have known moore would have been sacked had he failed to pull off the impossible so bannan's little speech felt like an authentic glimpse into the inner sanctum at a time when the emotions were real. wednesday's players were proud of their leader and the plan he hatched with his staff. one which included a nod to a fad revived this season by guardiola with defender liam palmer performing superbly in the john stones midfield role. palmer, a loyal and undervalued servant, scoring in the th minute to level the tie at - and take it into extra-time was simply one more unpredictable twist in the script. even guardiola was impressed.

"man city's alex robertson makes debut as aiden o'neill, keanu baccus and garang kuol also show strength of next generation in ecuador win despite him being barely minutes into his senior international career, nobody can accuse newly minted socceroo alex robertson of showing a lack of ambition for the future. indeed, it would be difficult for him to be showing any more. ""you've got to reach for the stars and win a world cup,"" he told reporters after australia's - win over ecuador on friday. ""you never know what's going to happen. you see what [australia's] just done at the last one and for the next few years, building up to [] i think we can do some really big things in the future. i mean, why not say it?"" in most circumstances, you'd call it brash. but if you're training week-in and week-out under pep guardiola as robertson is at manchester city, to say nothing of rubbing shoulders with players such as kevin de bryne, bernardo silva, and ilkay gundogan, then a few things are going to rub off on you. things such as an all-encompassing focus on winning and a special kind of belief in one's abilities to take whatever adverse circumstances are placed in front of you and replace it with a more acceptable reality. the kind of mental acuity that only the elite of the elite possesses. according to the marketing, friday evening's game was all about ""welcoming home"" and celebrating the achievements of the squad that belied all sense of rhyme and reason in qatar. an easy, feelgood moment for the side and football australia to soak it all in before competitive fixtures, and potential reality bricks to the face, return. but the present's great curse is that it will never quite match up to the plentiful future of the imagination. and with injured statesmen such as aaron mooy and mat leckie absent, the fixture quickly became about the mystery box that is the next-gen. robertson was one of two players to make their senior international debuts in sydney's west, melbourne city midfielder aiden o'neill starting alongside fellow -year-old keanu baccus in the heart of the socceroos' midfield. handed the task of containing moises caicedo, the duo unspectacularly but effectively marshalled the threat of the brighton man. and though one middling game won't make his suitors rethink their position, it was caicedo and not any error on their part - a poor back pass to piero hincapie - that provided the game's turning point in allowing australia to take a - lead. friday evening, as well as tuesday's return fixture in melbourne, never really had much hope of retaining a focus on reflection over projection. the coming game in victoria will likely see senior international debuts for joe gauci (), jordy bos () and nestory irankunda (), as well as potentially greater roles for connor metcalfe (), marco tilio (), nathaniel atkinson (), riley mcgree (), and cameron devlin (). alou kuol (), denis genreau (), tyrese francois (), daniel arzani (), and gianni stensness () will be watching at home. if it feels like there's a lot of talent coming through, that's because there is, and with more on the way behind them. certainly enough to banish the lazy (and incorrect) claim that australia doesn't have ""the cattle"" to compete in asia for a while. yes, there are never any guarantees in football, but a new generation is seemingly on the way, one that can give australian football fans reason to be optimistic. even if you'd struggle to find many quite as sanguine as robertson.'}",piero hincapie,en,2023-03-24T15:24:08Z
