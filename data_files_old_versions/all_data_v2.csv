"{'content': 'Slick Sevilla punish slapdash Man United to ease into Europa semis\n\nEuropa League kings Sevilla breezed past Manchester United into the semi-finals of their favourite competition as Youssef En Nesyri scored twice in a dominant 3-0 win on Thursday that secured a 5-2 aggregate triumph.\nBoth En Nesyri\'s goals came from mistakes by United goalkeeper David de Gea while trying to play the ball with his feet and it was a listless and error-strewn performance by the English side.\nSevilla were relentless with their high pressing and United, who led the first leg 2-0 before conceding two late goals at Old Trafford, never threatened to get back into the game amid a raucous atmosphere at a sold-out Sanchez Pizjuan stadium.\n""I have never seen an atmosphere like this in my entire life,"" En Nesyri told Movistar Plus.\n""I am very happy for the two goals and for the fans who supported us until the end.\n""We have to stay together, with the fans, because that\'s how we\'ll go far.""\n\nLanguishing in the bottom half of LaLiga during a difficult season in which two managers have been fired, Sevilla rediscovered their mojo at Old Trafford to grab a late 2-2 draw.\nIt took only eight minutes for Sevilla to open the scoring after De Gea delivered a hospital pass to Harry Maguire who was challenged by Erik Lamela and En Nesyri scooped up the loose ball to net from close range.\nSevilla wasted several chances and Lucas Ocampos had a goal ruled out by VAR due to offside in the build-up shortly before halftime.\nUnited manager Erik ten Hag brought on Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw as halftime substitutes but straight after the interval Sevilla defender Loic Bade scored with a towering header from a corner which went in off the crossbar.\nEn Nesyri wrapped up the win in the 81st minute after United goalkeeper David De Gea failed to deal with a long ball over the top and the Morocco striker finished well to move the Spanish side closer to a record-extending seventh victory in the competition.\n""We have to do better, that\'s the demand,"" Ten Hag told BT Sport.\n""We were not composed, not calm. We didn\'t beat the press, when you do there are so many spaces behind, and it was obvious at the start how to do it.\n""We lost the battles, they had more passion, more desire, more willingness. This was a great opportunity, a great occasion, to win something and we gave it away - we have to blame ourselves. It\'s gone, we can\'t change it.""\nSevilla will face Juventus in the semi-finals.\nUnited play Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday.\nJuventus draw with Sporting to book Europa semi-final spot\n\nAn early goal by midfielder Adrien Rabiot earned Juventus a 1-1 draw with Sporting in an entertaining Europa League clash on Thursday to win their quarter-final 2-1 on aggregate and set up a semi-final clash with Sevilla.\nJuventus, who saw their 15-point deduction in Serie A over the club\'s transfer dealings scrapped earlier on Thursday pending a new trial, had earned a 1-0 victory in the first leg with a second-half goal by defender Federico Gatti.\nThey will meet Sevilla in the semi-finals, with the Italians at home first on May 11 before the return leg in Spain on May 18, after the Spanish side knocked out Manchester United 5-2 on aggregate.\n""We suffered, we did good things in the second half at the beginning, but we have to do better when it comes to our chances,"" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said.\n""We knew it would be difficult but we are bringing home a good result.\n""I expected Sevilla (in the semi-finals) to be honest. They are a tricky team... They have won so many Europa Leagues so they definitely have an advantage. The signs from the last game (in Manchester) were in their favour, I had that feeling.""\nJuventus took an early lead through Rabiot who netted from close range after nine minutes following a corner.\nSporting winger Marcus Edwards equalised from the penalty spot in the 20th minute when he sent Juve keeper Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way with a strike into the middle of the goal after Rabiot was penalised for a tackle on Manuel Ugarte.\nThe Lisbon side had hit the woodwork moments before.\nSporting came close to taking a surprise lead and levelling the tie in the 35th minute when defender Ousmane Diomande connected with a corner but his header narrowly missed the target.\nJust before halftime, Sporting winger Nuno Santos tried to square the ball inside the box coming from the left but Juve defender Gleison Bremer blocked the threat right in front of the diving Szczesny.\nAfter the break Sporting pressed with confidence for possession but they squandered three more opportunities to level the match.\nRuben Amorim\'s side should have found the net in the 75th minute when defender Ricardo Esgaio latched on to a pass on the edge of the box only to see his volley fly over the bar, while Sebastian Coates spurned two more chances minutes from time.\nSporting have now completed a run of five home European matches without a win for the first time in the club\'s history, having recorded two losses and two draws in their previous four.\nThey have lost each of their last seven ties with Italian clubs.\nRoma score twice in extra time to book Europa semi-final spot\n\nStephan El Shaarawy and Lorenzo Pellegrini scored in extra time to earn hosts AS Roma a spot in the Europa League semi-finals after defeating Dutch side Feyenoord 4-1 on Thursday for a 4-2 aggregate win.\nEl Shaarawy converted a cross from Tammy Abraham after 101 minutes and captain Pellegrini, who missed a penalty in last week\'s first leg, sealed the win seven minutes later when he slotted in a rebound from an Abraham shot.\nPortuguese manager Jose Mourinho was full of praise for his team after reaching his second European semi-final in a row with Roma, following last season\'s Conference League title.\n""Maybe someone thinks differently, but in my view, the team played very well in a difficult match to deal with,"" he told Sky Sport Italia.\n""I\'m sure the fans would have gone home happy for the team regardless of the result. We have limits, but this team is a family.""\nAfter Feyenoord had won the quarter-final first leg 1-0, Roma pushed for the opening goal from the start, missing two great opportunities in the first 10 minutes.\nThe visitors became more involved in the match, with Roma keeper Rui Patricio forced to deny Sebastian Szymanski from close range.\nImmediately after halftime, Roma had an excellent chance when a cross found Pellegrini at the near post but his shot hit the post.\n""I have to say that the emotions started before the match. You know you have to win for these people who give everything for us – and, consequently, we have to give everything for them,"" Pellegrini said.\nOn the hour mark, roars of relief erupted around the Stadio Olimpico when Leonardo Spinazzola took advantage of a deflection in the box to poke the ball into the bottom corner.\nMourinho started with key players Paulo Dybala and Abraham on the bench, after they suffered injuries early in the first leg, but he sent them on midway through the second half to chase a decider.\nIn the 80th minute, Brazilian Igor Paixao headed in an equaliser for the visitors, unmarked inside the box from a cross by Szymanski, only for Dybala to level the aggregate score one minute before stoppage time with a shot from a tricky angle.\nFeyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez received a straight red card in the game\'s final moments for a knee-high tackle on Gianluca Mancini.\n""I am never angry when we don’t do well, because I know these players gave everything. Now we must rest as much as we can, prepare for Serie A and forget the Europa League for now,"" Mourinho said.\nRoma will meet Bayer Leverkusen in the semi-finals on May 11 and 18 after the German side knocked out Union Saint-Gilloise 5-2 on aggregate.\nLeverkusen crush hosts Union 4-1 to book Europa League last-four spot\n\nBayer Leverkusen eased into the Europa League semi-finals after crushing hosts Union Saint-Gilloise of Belgium 4-1 on Thursday for a 5-2 aggregate win that stretched their unbeaten run to 12 straight matches across all competitions.\nThe result means Leverkusen, the last German team left in any European competition this season, have reached their first European semi-final in 21 years while ending Union\'s fairytale maiden run in the Europa League.\n""The mentality of the team was the key tonight,"" said Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso, who has turned around their season since taking over in October.\n""Obviously the early first goal by Moussa Diaby was very helpful. But overall we did it very well.\n""Now the team is ready to fight in a semi-final. We are a step closer to reaching the final but I\'ll only talk about the semi-final,"" said the Spaniard.\nLeverkusen, who face AS Roma in the last four, proved extremely efficient, needing just 66 seconds for Diaby to round keeper Anthony Moris and finish a quick move by the Germans to open the scoring.\nThey added another goal on the break in the 38th with Mitchel Bakker volleying in at the far post before they were gifted a third on the hour courtesy of a big Moris blunder.\nUnder pressure from Bakker, the keeper sent the ball straight into the path of Jeremie Frimpong who only had to kick it into the empty goal.\nThe Belgians did breath some life into their game, cutting the deficit with Casper Terho\'s fine shot in the 65th, but could not find another goal despite more pressure\nLeverkusen made sure they snapped their opponents\' nine-game unbeaten run when Adam Hlozek pounced on a weak Moris save to make it 4-1 in the 79th.\n\nIndia Cricket Score\xa0 | \xa0Indian Cricket News\xa0 | \xa0Indian News\xa0 | \xa0Bollywood Movies\xa0 | \xa0India Business News'}",Mitchel Bakker,en

[+] second-leg football match against Union Saint-Gilloise (Photo by LAURIE DIEFFEMBACQ/BELGA/AFP via Getty Images)\nBayer Leverkusen has reached the semifinal of a European competition by beating Belgian side Union Saint-Gilles 4-1 (5-2 on aggregate) on Thursday thanks to goals by Moussa Diaby (2’), Mitchel Bakker (37’), Jeremie Frimpong (60’) and Adam Hlozek (79’). Casper Terho (65’) scored the only goal for the hosts.\nIt marks the first time Leverkusen has reached the semifinal of a European competition since the club reached the Champions League final in the 2001/02 season. That year, Die Werkself was narrowly beaten 2-1 by Real Madrid thanks to a wonder strike by legendary French midfielder Zinedine Zidane. It was also the year that Leverkusen finished second in the league, second in the DFB Pokal, and then a large portion of the squad also finished second in the World Cup behind Brazil.\nThat season marked the origin of the term Vizekusen (Neverkusen). It is a term that current head coach Xabil Alonso wants to stamp out at the club. And a title for Leverkusen would do just that for a club that has won nothing since the 1992/93 season when the club beat Hertha Berlin’s reserve side to win the DFB Pokal.\nIn fairness, Leverkusen has had success in the Europa League, or rather its predecessor, the UEFA\nEFA\n Cup, winning the competition in 1988 by beating Spanish side Espanol. Now Leverkusen is just 180 minutes away from reaching the final of a European competition once again. While beating Roma will be difficult, there is a sense of optimism around the club that this is the year for Leverkusen to end the title drought.\nDirector of sports Simon Rolfes has stressed in the past that the Europa League would be an excellent pathway to end Leverkusen’s wait for a title. ""It is a big goal for us to win a title,"" Rolfes said in an interview conducted in November 2019. ""We have to have the ambitions to win the Europa League. It has to be our goal to play a key role in that competition.""\nNow four years later, the club has a realistic chance of winning an international trophy. In fact, winning the Europa League might be the most straightforward pathway to the Champions League, as Leverkusen is currently sixth, seven points behind fourth-placed RB Leipzig.\nBayer Leverkusen beat Espanol in 1988 to win the UEFA Cup (Photo by Bongarts/Getty Images)\n""We are focused on the semi-finals and are looking forward to preparing well,” Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso said after the game to UEFA.com. “The energy is good. Being in the semi-finals is great, but once you get there, you want more. We will do everything to win.""\nAlonso, of course, has been one of the major reasons for Leverkusen’s resurgence in the Bundesliga and the run of form in the Europa League. Since taking over the club in October, the Spaniard has overseen 29 games, won 16, drawn six, and only lost seven. Only Bayern, Dortmund, and Leipzig have collected more points in the Bundesliga since Alonso has taken over the club.\nThe Spaniard has been one of the major reasons for Leverkusen’s recent success. Another reason is Florian Wirtz. The teenage sensation has scored four goals and eight assists in 18 games since returning from his ACL injury. One of the most talented players on the planet, Wirtz has been crucial for his club’s success in recent weeks, and the 19-year-old is now fully focused on winning his first major trophy.\n""I\'d love to win the title,” Wirtz said to the German station RTL after the game. “It doesn\'t really bother me who we meet in the next round. We\'re going to see who it will be and will then prepare ourselves as well as possible for the next opponent."" Leverkusen does not want to sell Wirtz this summer, and winning the Europa League, which would come with an automatic spot in next season’s Champions League group stage, would go a long way to ensure that the forward will stay with the club.\nThat would be one significant advantage of winning the title. Another would be the added prestige a Europa League triumph would bring to the Bundesliga. Eintracht Frankfurt’s success last season was widely recognized around Europe, and for the league to grow, the Bundesliga will need other teams than Bayern to keep up the flag in Europe. Having back-to-back Europa League winners might not only keep a star in the league but also add significant prestige to the competition overall.\nManuel Veth is the host of the Bundesliga Gegenpressing Podcast and the Area Manager USA at Transfermarkt.

"{'content': 'Am ende Applaus nach einer Nullnummer in der Alten Försterei.\n(Foto: IMAGO/Matthias Koch)\nUnion Berlin hat seine Champions-League-Ambitionen gegen formstarke Leverkusener verteidigt - und zugleich die beeindruckende Heimserie ausgebaut. Und auch Freiburg unterstreicht, dass es bei der Verteilung der internationalen Startplätze weiter hohe Ziele hat. Unten gelingt hingegen Stuttgart im Abstiegskampf ein wichtiger Schritt.\nUnion Berlin vs. Bayer 04 Leverkusen 0:0\nAm Ende wurden beide Teams von ihren Fans gefeiert - und das nach einem 0:0. Union Berlin war sehr froh, dass es gegen Bayer Leverkusen - vielleicht die derzeit formstärkste Mannschaft der Bundesliga - zu einem Heimpunkt gereicht hat. ""Es war eine Riesenleistung"", sagte Union-Geschäftsführer Oliver Ruhnert bei Sky. Mit 56 Punkten bleiben die Köpenicker vier Spieltage vor Saisonende auf Rang drei. Zudem blieben sie saisonübergreifend im 21. Liga-Heimspiel ungeschlagen.\nWährend Bayer mit dem eigenen Ballbesitz lange zu wenig anzufangen wusste, waren es die Gastgeber, die blitzschnell konterten. Der umtriebige Sheraldo Becker prüfte erst Bayers Torwart Lukas Hradecky per Fernschuss (5.), ehe er drei Minuten später in höchster Not von Odilon Kossounou (8.) geblockt wurde. Leverkusens Innenverteidiger klärte nur kurz darauf erneut - diesmal gegen Jordan Siebatcheu (11.). Wenn Leverkusen gefährlich wurde, dann meist durch Moussa Diaby, der entweder aus spitzem Winkel drüber zielte (17.) oder den Ball nicht richtig traf (32.).\nAuch unmittelbar nach der Pause war Union das zwingendere Team. Aissa Laidouni (48.) jagte einen abgeblockten Ball zunächst knapp über das Bayer Tor, bevor es für die Gäste so richtig brenzlig wurde: Unions Außenverteidiger Jerome Roussillon dribbelte sich auf der linken Seite stark durch, als Leverkusens Mitchel Bakker erst im letzten vor dem einschussbereiten Laidouni (60.) klären konnte.\n1. FC Köln vs. SC Freiburg 0:1 (0:0)\nDer SC Freiburg ist nur noch vier Schritte von der erstmaligen Champions-League-Teilnahme entfernt. In Köln kamen die Breisgauer zu einem etwas schmeichelhaften 1:0 (0:0). Trotz lange Zeit mäßiger Leistung konnten sich die Breisgauer wieder auf ihre Standard-Stärke verlassen. Der Treffer von Ritsu Doan (54.) nach einem Eckball war der 20. nach einem ruhenden Ball in dieser Saison. Wie glücklich der Sieg war, wusste auch SC-Trainer Christian Streich, der beim Schlusspfiff die Hände vor dem Gesicht zusammenschlug. Die Kölner dürften trotz der Niederlage angesichts von sieben Punkten Vorsprung auf den Relegationsplatz nicht mehr in Abstiegsgefahr geraten.\nGute Laune bei den Trainern aus Freiburg und Köln.\n(Foto: dpa)\nStreich vertraute auf das bewährte Personal und hatte klare Vorgaben für das Spiel: ""Wir offensiv, die offensiv, beide gut spielen – und am Ende gewinnen wir."" Doch so richtig kam das Spiel zunächst in Gange, vor allem die Gäste nicht. Richtig gefährlich wurde es erstmals in der 21. Minute, und das eigentlich ohne Not. SC-Keeper Mark Flekken segelte unter einer Flanke hindurch, den folgenden Schuss von Linton Maina hielt er dafür gut. Und ganz stark parierte der niederländische Nationalkeeper zwei Minuten später einen Kopfball von Eric Martel aus drei Metern.\nVon Freiburg war offensiv indes lange Zeit gar nichts zu sehen, Streich drückte sein Missfallen an dem in der ersten halben Stunde behäbigen Auftritt entsprechend gestenreich aus. Doch die erste Freiburger Gelegenheit war gleich eine riesige. Auch in der Folge entschärfte Köln-Keeper Marvin Schwäbe mehrere Versuche der Gäste. Und dann wurden die Freiburger für ihre verstärkten Bemühungen belohnt. Nach einem Eckball von Christian Günter verlängerte Höler an den langen Pfosten und Doan köpfte aus zwei Metern ungehindert ein. Danach wurde das Spiel etwas munterer. Freiburg hatte weitere Chancen, doch auch die Kölner blieben immer gefährlich. Doch Flekken verhinderte ein Eigentor von Philipp Lienhart , Steffen Tigges schlenzte knapp drüber.\nRB Leipzig vs. TSG Hoffenheim 1:0 (1:0)\nBei Leipzig macht rechtzeitig zum Saisonendspurt Christopher Nkunku wieder den Unterschied aus. Der Franzose krönte sein Startelf-Comeback bei RB mit dem Siegtreffer in der 28. Minute beim 1:0 (1:0) gegen die TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. Die Mannschaft von Marco Rose hat im Kampf um die Champions League weiterhin eine gute Ausgangsposition und kann den direkten Kontrahenten SC Freiburg kommenden Samstag selbst besiegen.\nTorschütze Nkunku mit Gruß an den Sohnemann.\n(Foto: dpa)\nDas Startelf-Comeback vor 45.294 Zuschauern von Nkunku nach mehr als zwei Monaten hätte schon nach 91 Sekunden gekrönt werden können. Erst ließ der quirlige Franzose Ozan Kabak aussteigen, scheiterte dann aber mit seinem schwächeren linken Fuß an Torhüter Oliver Baumann und Kabak, der sich noch dazwischenwarf. Wie schon beim torlosen RB-Auftritt in Leverkusen (0:2) patzten die Sachsen vor dem Tor bei besten Möglichkeiten.\nNach einem Konter konnte der Ex-Hoffenheimer David Raum (26.) nach einem Traumpass von Mohamed Simakan den Abschluss suchen, doch er verpasste den direkten Schuss. Besser machte es Nkunku (28.): Im Zusammenspiel mit Emil Forsberg traf er zur Führung und zückte für seinen Sohn einen roten Luftballon aus dem Stutzen, blies ihn auf und genoss sein erstes Tor in diesem Jahr.\nDie mutlos agierenden Hoffenheimer, die zuletzt unter Pellegrino Matarazzo drei Siege und zehn Punkte aus fünf Spielen holten, kamen erst in der 38. Minute zur ersten richtigen Torchance. Christoph Baumgartner scheiterte am glänzend parierenden RB-Keeper Janis Blaswich. Nach dem Wechsel kam Hoffenheim mit mehr Schwung aus der Kabine, die besseren Chancen hatte aber erneut RB.\nVfB Stuttgart vs. Borussia Mönchengladbach 2:1 (1:0)\nDer VfB Stuttgart hat die Abstiegsränge verlassen. Durch ein 2:1 (1:0) gegen Borussia Mönchengladbach kletterten die Schwaben auf Rang 15 vor dem punktgleichen VfL Bochum. Vor eigenem Publikum hatten die Stuttgarter seit 18. Februar nicht mehr gewonnen. Den verdienten Sieg bescherte dem VfB ein von Tanguy Coulibaly verwandelter Elfmeter (83.) - Gladbachs Kou Itakura sah für das Foul an Tiago Tomas die Rote Karte (82.). Durch ein lange überprüftes Tor des guten Serhou Guirassy (22.) war Stuttgart zunächst in Führung gegangen, den Ausgleich hatte Julian Weigl per Handelfmeter erzielt (78.). Durch den Sieg stehen die Gastgeber erstmals seit dem 23. Spieltag nicht mehr auf einem der letzten drei Plätze.\nGladbach braucht zu lange, um gegen Stuttgart auf Touren zu kommen.\n(Foto: dpa)\nStuttgart bestimmte vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit das Spiel gegen schlampige Gladbacher. Was aber zunächst fehlte, waren gute Torchancen. Das änderte sich jedoch nach 20 Minuten schlagartig. Erst musste sich Gladbachs Torhüter Jonas Omlin bei einem Schuss von Millot lang machen. Kurz darauf lenkte Guirassy den Ball auf Vorlage von Waldemar Anton mit der Hacke ins Tor, nach zweiminütiger Videoüberprüfung zählte der Treffer dann auch.\nErst danach nahmen die Gladbacher entschlossener am Spiel teil, was die wackelige Stuttgarter Abwehr prompt in Schwierigkeiten brachte. VfB-Torhüter Fabian Bredlow verhinderte gegen Alassane Plea mit einer Glanzparade den raschen Ausgleich (33.). Der VfB verpasste danach mehrere Chancen, die Führung auszubauen. Nach einem unbeabsichtigten Schlag ins Gesicht von Gladbachs Lars Stindl (51.) musste der umtriebige Torschütze Guirassy vom Feld, ersetzt wurde er von Tiago Tomas. In der Folge zog sich der VfB zunehmend zurück, hatte aber dennoch die Gelegenheit, die Führung auszubauen.\nEintracht Frankfurt vs. FC Augsburg 1:1 (1:0)\nEintracht Frankfurt hat die Negativserie mit dem 1:1 (1:0) gegen den FC Augsburg auf neun sieglose Bundesligaspiele verlängert. Die Chance auf den erneuten Einzug in einen Europacup-Wettbewerb ist damit weiter gesunken Nach der Führung für die Hessen durch ein Eigentor von Elvis Rexhbecaj (25. Minute, konnte Ermedin Demirovic (58.) mit einem sehenswerten Treffer den Ausgleich vor 50.000 Zuschauern erzielen.\nDie lange Durststrecke seit Mitte Februar, als zuletzt ein Sieg gegen Werder Bremen (2:0) gelungen war, hat bei den Frankfurtern Spuren und Verunsicherung hinterlassen. Der Spielaufbau war erneut mühsam und zäh - und sehenswerte Kombinationen Mangelware. Außerdem musste die Eintracht noch den Ausfall von Mittelfeld-Dauerläufer Djibril Sow verkraften, der kurz vor dem Anpfiff wegen Unwohlsein nicht spielen konnte.\nAuch die gegen den Abstieg kämpfenden, lange Zeit harmlosen Gäste, die aus den vorherigen zehn Auswärtspartien nur zwei Punkte holten, hatten in der Offensive so gut wie nichts zu bieten. Nach dem Seitenwechsel machten die Gäste mehr Dampf. In der 48. Minute lenkte Nationaltorwart Kevin Trapp einen Schuss mit den Fingerspitzen noch zur Ecke. Machtlos war Trapp zehn Minuten danach gegen den 25-jährigen Angreifer, der den Ball bei einer Flanke von Ruben Vargas volley ins Frankfurter Gehäuse weiterleitete.\nQuelle: ntv.de, jwu/sid/dpa'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

FC Union hat im Spitzenspiel die besseren Chancen, kann jedoch keinen weiteren großen Schritt Richtung Champions League machen.\n29.04.2023, 17:32\xa0Uhr | Update: 29.04.2023, 18:32\xa0Uhr\nDie Ecke hatte Jeremie Frimpong hereingeschlagen, den Kopfball brachte Mitchel Bakker aufs Tor. Dieser stellte für Frederik Rönnow, den Torwart des 1. FC Union, jedoch keine große Herausforderung dar. Bemerkenswert war die Szene trotzdem: Es war das erste Mal im Spiel gegen Bayer Leverkusen, dass Rönnow richtig eingreifen musste. In der 86. Minute.\nDa Union ebenfalls nicht sonderlich viele Gelegenheiten gehabt hatte, gab es bis dahin keine Tore. Und auch danach nicht. „Für mich war es ein intensives, tolles 0:0-Spiel“, sagte Unions Trainer Urs Fischer: „Wir haben gegen die derzeit formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten gut mitgehalten und mitgespielt.“\nUnion war nach vorn die aktivere Mannschaft und hatte die besseren Chancen. Trotzdem überwog am Ende die Zufriedenheit über den geholten Punkt: „Gegen eine solch offensivstarke Mannschaft ohne Gegentor zu bleiben, ist schon eine Auszeichnung“, sagte Verteidiger Robin Knoche.\nWer weiß, wofür dieses Unentschieden noch gut ist, wenn die Saison in vier Wochen endet. „In der Endabrechnung kann dir vielleicht jeder Punkt helfen“, sagte Fischer. Erst einmal ist der Vorsprung des Tabellendritten in Sachen Champions-League-Ränge allerdings geschmolzen, da die Verfolger SC Freiburg und RB Leipzig jeweils 1:0 beim 1. FC Köln beziehungsweise gegen die TSG Hoffenheim gewannen. Doch zumindest hält Union den Sechsten Bayer weiter acht Punkte auf Distanz.\nBeide Serien hielten am Sonnabend im ausverkauften Stadion An der Alten Försterei vor 22.012 Fans: Union bleibt weiter seit Mitte Februar 2022 in der Fußball-Bundesliga zu Hause ungeschlagen. Leverkusen ist nun wettbewerbsübergreifend 14 Pflichtspiele nacheinander ohne Niederlage.\nIm Vergleich zum komplett überzeugenden Auftritt zuletzt bei Borussia Mönchengladbach veränderte Trainer Fischer sein Team nur auf einer Position. Für den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens spielte Jordan Siebatcheu von Beginn an. Bei den Gästen war neben Edmond Tapsoba nach überstandenem Magen-Darm-Infekt auch wieder Florian Wirtz dabei.\nUnion: Rönnow - Doekhi, Knoche, Leite - Laidouni (69. Schäfer), Haberer (78. Thorsby) - Juranovic, Khedira, Roussillon (90. Gießelmann) - Siebatcheu (78. S. Michel), S. BeckerLeverkusen: Hradecky - Kossounou, Tah, Hincapié - Frimpong, Andrich, Tapsoba, Bakker - Hlozek (62. Azmoun), Diaby (62. Adli), Wirtz.Schiedsrichter: Fritz.Zuschauer: 22.012 (ausverkauft)\nWirtz war es auch, der die erste vielversprechende Vorwärtsbewegung der Gäste einleitete. Nach seinem Zuspiel in der 17. Minute verzog Moussa Diaby. Bis dahin hatte nur Union gespielt und in einer stürmischen Anfangsphase mehrere gute Gelegenheiten gehabt. Doch Bayers Abwehrspieler Odilon Kossounou klärte zweimal in letzter Sekunde und ein Kopfball von Jordan fand nicht sein Ziel.\nAb Mitte der ersten Hälfte verlor die Begegnung deutlich an Tempo. Union stand hinten sehr sicher. Bayer kam nach vorn weiterhin so gut wie gar nicht zum Zuge, sorgte nur bei Kontern mitunter für Gefahr. Bei der besten Chance traf Diaby nach Zuspiel von Mitchel Bakker den Ball nicht richtig. Kurz vor der Pause rutschte Frimpong in aussichtsreicher Position beim Versuch weg, den Ball anzunehmen.\nWie die erste begann auch die zweite Hälfte recht flott. Diesmal mit, allerdings eher Halbchancen auf beiden Seiten. Ab der 60. Minute waren die Gastgeber erneut die zielstrebigere Mannschaft, kamen meist über die linke Seite. Am nächsten dran am Führungstreffer war Becker, dessen Schlenzer am rechten Pfosten vorbei flog. Danach tat sich in der Nähe beider Tore wieder äußerst wenig.\nErst in der Schlussphase drehte Bayer etwas auf, außer beim Kopfball von Bakker musste Torwart Rönnow aber nicht eingreifen. So fand nicht nur Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso: „Das Unentschieden ist ein faires Ergebnis.“\n\nZur Startseite\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

Trainer Fischer: „Das war ein gewonnener Punkt.“\nBerlin.\xa0 Die berühmte Frage, ob dieses torlose Unentschieden für Union Berlin nun ein Punktgewinn oder zwei verlorene Zähler seien, wussten die Profis des Berliner Fußball-Bundesligisten kaum eindeutig einzuschätzen. „Zu Null zu spielen gegen eine so offensivstarke Mannschaft ist schon eine Auszeichnung“, sagte Robin Knoche. Als Abwehrchef kommt er um diese Aussage praktisch gar nicht herum.\nDann ist da Sheraldo Becker, seines Zeichens Stürmer von Union Berlin, und mit ihm ein nicht ganz so positives Urteil über das 0:0 gegen Bayer Leverkusen am Sonnabend. „Wir haben uns nicht belohnt, hätten ein, zwei Tore machen müssen“, sagte Becker. Er selbst hatte sich immer wieder in gute Positionen gespielt.\nSchließlich versuchte sich Trainer Urs Fischer an einer Analyse. „Meine Mannschaft hat das über 90 Minuten sehr gut gemacht. Gerade dieses Umschaltspiel von Leverkusen konnten wir neutralisieren. Von daher bekommt die Mannschaft ein dickes Lob. Auf Grund der Art und Weise ist es ein gewonnener Punkt.“\nUnion Berlin hat den Vereinsrekord von 21 Bundesliga-Heimspielen in Folge ohne Niederlage eingestellt. Und was die Champions-League-Träume an der Alten Försterei angeht, so ist dieses Remis gegen die „Werkself“ ohne Zweifel ein kleiner Rückschlag angesichts der Siege der Verfolger SC Freiburg (1:0 beim 1. FC Köln) und RB Leipzig (1:0 gegen die TSG Hoffenheim).\nFür das ausgerufene Ziel – erneute Teilnahme am internationalen Wettbewerb – war dieser eine Punkt gegen Leverkusen Gold wert. Union hat als Tabellendritter die Leverkusener (Rang sechs) mit acht Punkten auf Distanz gehalten. Soll heißen: Zumindest die Europa League ist bei nur noch vier ausstehenden Spielen und zwölf zu vergebenen Punkten zum Greifen nah.\nKompakt und organisiert sollte die Mannschaft agieren. Das hatte Trainer Fischer seinen Spielern mit auf den Weg gegeben. „Auch Restverteidigung wird ein Thema sein. Es braucht kurze Abstände, du musst da sein, um zu unterstützen“, sagte Fischer im Vorfeld.\nNur eines sollte nicht passieren, so der Union-Coach: „Wenn wir beginnen, abwartend zu spielen, hat uns das noch nie geholfen. Wir tun gut daran, von der ersten Minuten an aktiv im Spiel zu sein und uns auch mit dem Ball etwas zuzutrauen.“\nUnion agierte organisiert und solidarisch. Und der Tabellendritte traute sich auch etwas zu. Mit Jordan Siebatcheu als Ersatz für den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens, ansonsten lief das gleiche Team auf, das vor einer Woche bei Borussia Mönchengladbach 1:0 gewonnen hatte.\nUnaufgeregt, aber hellwach beim Verteidigen des eigenen Tores, dafür umso explosiver nach Ballgewinnen, wenn es in Richtung des Leverkusener Kastens ging. Viel lief dabei erwartungsgemäß über Sheraldo Becker, der von Bayers Odilon Kossounou geblockt (8.) wurde und dessen Flanke drei Minuten später Siebatcheu nur knapp verfehlte (11.).\nLeverkusen? Erstaunlich abwartend, wenngleich fußballerisch klar überlegen. Florian Wirtz, Mitchel Bakker, natürlich Moussa Diaby, dahinter Ex-Unioner Robert Andrich als aggressive leader wussten zu wirbeln. Und sie kamen zu Chancen durch Diaby, einmal von Witz in Szene gesetzt (17., Haberer hatte den Ball zuvor an Andrich verloren), einmal von Bakker (32., Jerome Roussillon konnte klären).\nNach dem Seitenwechsel erhöhte Union die Schlagzahl. Aissa Laidouni (48.), Becker (59.) und Siebatcheu (60.), der den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens ersetzte, kamen zu Chancen. Ein Tor wollte jedoch nicht gelingen.\nUnd natürlich legte auch Leverkusen noch einen Gang zu, drückte Union in der Schlussphase an den eigenen Strafraum. Dennoch sprang nur ein Kopfball von Bakker heraus, den Union-Torwart Frederik Rönnow in höchster Not parieren konnte (86.). Es war die größte, weil einzige Chance der Leverkusener, bei denen der Union-Schlussmann eingreifen musste.\n„Am Ende des Spiels musst du dann auch clever genug und mit einem Punkt zufrieden sein. In der Endabrechnung kann dir so ein Punkt noch helfen“, sagte Fischer zum Abschluss. Sein Abwehrchef Knoche schlug schließlich in dieselbe Kerbe: „Ich habe immer gesagt, jeder Punkt hilft uns.“\nEs war kein Geringerer als Bayer-Coach Xabi Alonso, der bei seinem ersten Besuch in der Alten Försterei jene Worte sprach, die aus der Nullnummer einen Punktgewinn für Union machen. „Union hat zu Hause in dieser Saison noch nicht verloren. Wir haben heute gefühlt, warum“, sagte der Weltmeister von 2010.\nMehr über Union Berlin lesen Sie hier.'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

Gute Gründe für ein paar Überlegungen in diese Richtung hat er angesichts der Entwicklungen im Meisterkampf aber zweifellos gehabt, und dass der Trainer von RB Leipzig am Sonntag ziemlich viel über Fußball nachdachte, war nicht zu übersehen, während der 0:2-Niederlage bei Bayer Leverkusen.\nImmer wieder stand Rose in Denkerpose in seiner Coachingzone, kraulte seinen Bart und fand doch keine Lösung gegen das Team seines derzeit erfolgreichen Kollegen Xabi Alonso, der noch auf den Gewinn der Europa League hoffen kann. Mit einer ebenso schlauen wie pragmatischen Spielweise haben die Leverkusener durch Tore von Adam Hlozek und Nadiem Amiri Leipzig besiegt.\nGut 25 Minuten war praktisch nichts passiert in dieser Partie, die als eine Art Spitzenspiel um die Teilnahme an der kommenden Champions-League-Saison betrachtet werden konnte.\xa0Leverkusen\xa0wirkte matt. Und Leipzig ist in diesem Frühjahr einfach unzuverlässig, schwer berechenbar und ineffizient.\nDas Spiel floss in etlichen Phasen ruhig vor sich hin. Bis die etwas intensivere Schlussphase begann, passierte abgesehen von einzelnen Momenten nicht sehr viel. Früh im Spiel vergeudete die Werkself eine tolle Vier-gegen-Einen-Konterchance, weil Mitchell Bakker ins Abseits gelaufen war, und vor dem Leverkusener Tor kam Dominik Szoboszlai zu einem Torabschluss aus guter Position, schoss jedoch nicht platziert genug (30.). Unter der Abwesenheit von Florian Wirtz litt scheinbar nicht nur die Werkself, sondern das gesamte Spielniveau.\nDer Nationalspieler saß aufgrund eines Magen-Darm-Infektes auf der Tribüne, von wo er dann nach 40 Minuten die Führung für sein Team bejubeln konnte. Robert Andrich hatte einen exzellenten Pass in die Tiefe auf Moussa Diaby gespielt, der den Ball in den Rücken der Abwehr weiterleitete, von wo Hlozek aus elf Metern zum 1:0 traf.

Das war nicht gefährlich genug, und die Leverkusener Gegenangriffe stoppten die Leipziger immer wieder mit Fouls.

Üblicherweise informiert er nach gewonnenen Spielen in eigener Sache, er werde sich abends ""ein, zwei Bierchen"" gönnen, diesmal aber ging er als Teamsprecher im Stil eines Lokomotivführer-Gewerkschafters in die Tarifverhandlungen: ""Ich glaube, fünf Bier sind erlaubt"", sagte er mit Blick auf die dreistündige Busreise ins Rheinland. Simon Rolfes, der Vertreter der Arbeitgeberseite, deutete Entgegenkommen an (""das eine oder andere geht schon""), wies aber auch auf gebotene Grenzen hin: ""Das Fußballer-Leben ist\xa0hart.""\nRB Leipzig, am Sonntag der nächste Bundesliga-Gegner, darf sich womöglich freuen: Euphorisierte Leverkusener Profifußballer sind traditionell gern bereit, beim nächsten Pflichttermin etwas weniger diensteifrig aufzutreten. Bei dieser Mannschaft und diesem Trainer weiß man allerdings nicht, ob überlieferte Sitten noch gelten. Zwar erzählt man sich am Rhein, Disziplin sei nicht die hervorragende Eigenschaft des aktuellen Bayer-Kaders, zugleich versichern die Bayer-Verantwortlichen jedoch, Trainer Xabi Alonso sei ein Mann, dem Disziplin und hausinterne Regeltreue viel bedeuteten. Es sieht so aus, als ob er sich damit durchsetzen\xa0würde.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Interview von Javier Cáceres\nBeim Europacup-Rückspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise obsiegte eindeutig die Linie des spanischen Trainers. Leverkusens 4:1-Sieg drückte nicht nur eine konzentrierte Leistung aus, er sah auch nach dem Triumph einer Mannschaft aus, die mit einer klaren Strategie ins Spiel gegangen war. Als Alonso nach dem 1:1 gegen eine abgezockte Union-Elf im Hinspiel vor einer Woche in aller Gelassenheit betonte, Bayer sei ""bereit"" und ""gut vorbereitet"" für die zweite Folge, klang das verdächtig vielsagend. Nun führte die Mannschaft vor, dass der Trainer für die beiden Viertelfinal-Spiele einen kombinierten Plan entworfen\xa0hatte.\nDass sein Team schon nach 67 Sekunden unter glücklichen Umständen in Führung gehen würde - Torschütze Moussa Diaby erhielt die Vorlage von Gegnerseite -, konnte zwar selbst der Fußballweise Alonso nicht voraussehen. Doch schon in der ersten Minute wurde die Leverkusener Spielanlage sichtbar, die von offensiven Rollenwechseln und einem stabilen defensiven Fundament geprägt war. Diaby, Florian Wirtz, Adam Hlozek und Jeremie Frimpong teilten sich die Räume nach Bedarf und Belieben. Auf der linken Seite marschierte derweil Mitchel Bakker auf und nieder, dass Hradecky an ein anatomisches Wunder glaubte: ""Ich weiß nicht, wie viele Lungen der Mann hat, wahrscheinlich mehr als\xa0zwei.""\nDem niederländischen Linksverteidiger Bakker, 22, wird nachgesagt, er verstehe es, innerhalb von zwei Szenen eines Fußballspiels sowohl Welt- als auch Kreisklasse zu verkörpern. Ferner ist er berüchtigt für häufiges Zuspätkommen, was ihn außer einigen Euro auch Einsätze bei Punktspielen gekostet hat. Zuletzt ist aber eine gewisse Regelmäßigkeit in seinen Arbeitszeiten eingekehrt, was auch für Bakkers Auftreten im Spiel gilt. Wild ist es hin und wieder immer noch, aber nicht mehr wüst wie früher. Beim Treffer zum 2:0 (37.) blieb Bakker cool und vollendete damit einen meisterlich ausgespielten Gegenangriff über Wirtz, Diaby und Flankengeber Hlozek. Am 3:0 (60.) hatte er seinen Anteil, als er dem zögerlichen Union-Torwart Anthony Moris so sehr zusetzte, dass dieser den Ball für Frimpong geradewegs zum Einschuss\xa0bereitlegte.\n21 Jahre sind vergangen, seit Bayer 04 das letzte Mal im Halbfinale eines Eurocups gestanden hat, es war die Saison, in der sich das Team um Ballack, Lucio, Bastürk und Berbatov als dreimaliger Vize unselig verewigte: in der Meisterschaft, im Pokal und in der Champions League. Kurioserweise hieß es vor dieser Saison, der aktuelle Bayer-Kader sei dank hochkarätiger Besetzung am ehesten geeignet, mit dem Ensemble von damals zu konkurrieren. Unselig geriet aber auch dessen Mission zunächst, und die ersten Amtshandlungen des im Herbst anstelle von Gerardo Seoane eingesetzten Trainers Alonso wollten ebenfalls nicht gleich\xa0glücken.\nInzwischen jedoch hat er Spieler wie Bakker neu erfunden, andere Spieler wiederentdeckt, die schon unauffindbar im Kader verloren gegangen waren (Exequiel Palacios, Nadiem Amiri), und wieder andere Spieler auf selten erreichtes Niveau getrimmt (Verteidiger Jonathan Tah). Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso. Leverkusens ""semifinalwürdige Leistung"" (Hradecky) in Brüssel wird weiter dazu\xa0beitragen.\nGerüchte darüber, dass ihn Real Madrids Patron Florentino Pérez als Nachfolger für Carlo Ancelotti herbeiwünscht - womöglich schon im Sommer -, sind auch den Bayer-Oberen bekannt und werden von ihnen nicht für unglaubwürdig gehalten. Sie verweisen jedoch gelassen auf seine Vertragsdauer (bis 2024) und auf Alonsos Klugheit. Als Trainer-Neuling hat er in Leverkusen schon viel gelernt, aber er wird noch viel mehr dazulernen können. Das Treffen mit der AS Rom im Halbfinale bietet dazu die beste Gelegenheit, dann bekommt er es mit dem alten Meistermacher José Mourinho zu\xa0tun.\nDer spektakuläre Trainerwechsel hat bei den Bayern die Saison nicht gerettet und bereits jetzt Thomas Tuchel beschädigt. Dennoch fehlt die Fantasie, dass jemand dafür Verantwortung übernehmen muss - wenn doch, würde es spannend.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Seitdem Xabi Alonso Bayer 04 Anfang Oktober auf dem 17. Tabellenplatz übernommen hat, hat der Spanier die Mannschaft in einem schmerzhaften und nicht an Rückschlägen armen Umerziehungsprozess von einem wilden Haufen hochbegabter, aber genauso taktisch undisziplinierter Künstler zu einem Kollektiv geformt, das immer mehr die Konturen einer echten Spitzenmannschaft annimmt.\n""Es sind nur sechs, sieben Monate, aber es ist viel passiert. Am Anfang war es nicht einfach, aber es ist immer eine Entwicklung. Wir sind zufrieden, dass wir diese Stimmung verändern konnten und jetzt in dieser Position sind in der Bundesliga und in Europa"", resümierte Leverkusens Trainer später in den Katakomben der altehrwürdigen Arena.\nWobei er den größten Fortschritt der Kicker des Tabellensechsten zwischen den Ohren bewirkt hat. ""Wir haben geholfen, aber am meisten liegt es an den Spielern. Der Kopf muss stimmen. Ich habe immer gesagt, wir haben die Qualität, aber der Kopf ist wichtiger. Im Moment haben wir ein gutes Zusammenspiel zwischen Qualität und der Mentalität.  Dadurch haben wir es bis hierher geschafft"", erklärte der Spanier, um direkt deutlich zu machen, dass Anderlecht nur eine Zwischenstation gewesen sein soll, mit den Worten ""Und wir wollen mehr!"".\nNicht nur für einen Titelsammler wie Xabi Alonso kann dies einzig bedeuten, die Europa League zu gewinnen. ""Jetzt haben wir noch eine Reise. Wir werden sehen, wohin sie geht"", philosophierte der 41-Jährige und meinte damit sicher nicht nur den nächsten Gegner, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch in Rom in der Verlängerung zwischen der AS und Feyenoord Rotterdam\xa0(4:1 für Rom n.V.) ermittelt wurde. Der insgesamt erwachsene Auftritt in Belgien, bei dem Bayer einzig in der Viertelstunde nach dem 1:3 der Gastgeber ins Wanken geriet, deklariert den Bundesligisten als Titelanwärter.\nDer Wandel der Werkself unter Xabi Alonso ist mittlerweile unverkennbar. Und der Reifegrad dieser Mannschaft wurde in den 90 Minuten in Anderlecht gerade darin offenkundig, dass es eine Leistung der Leverkusener war, die über Jahre als völlig untypisch eingeordnet worden wäre. So präsentierte sich das Team in der Defensive mit einem überragenden Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah über eine Stunde lang so stabil, dass die keineswegs enttäuschenden Belgier bis dahin zu keiner ernsthaften Chance kamen. Erst als Xabi Alonso den starken Edmond Tapsoba aufgrund muskulärer Probleme in der Dreierkette durch Odilon Kossounou ersetzen musste, geriet der Bundesligist zwischenzeitlich in Bedrängnis.\nUmgekehrt zeigte sich Bayer, über Jahre der Inbegriff für Chancenwucher, bis auf die Endphase in der Offensive brutal effizient. Wobei man bei aller Euphorie im Leverkusener Lager anmerken muss, dass Saint-Gilles mit groben Aussetzern beim ersten und dritten Treffer der Werkself extrem in die Karten spielte.\nDass sich mit Mitchel Bakker zur Krönung des Unerwarteten ein Problemprofi zum herausragenden Akteur dieser Partie aufschwang, war die Pointe dieser phantastischen Reise, die Bayer unter Xabi Alonso im Zeitraffer absolviert hat. Der niederländische linke Schienenspieler, der in dieser Saison lang nur durch sportliche wie disziplinarische Aussetzer aufgefallen war, erzielte nicht nur das 2:0, provozierte nicht nur durch sein energisches Nachsetzen gegen Union-Keeper Anthony Moris dessen Fehlpass auf Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong vor dem 3:0 und setzte nicht nur mit einem feinen Zuspiel Moussa Diaby mit dem vorletzten Pass beim 4:1 durch Adam Hlozek in Szene, sondern präsentierte sich auch spielerisch ansprechend, defensiv solide sowie extrem einsatzfreudig.\nNicht umsonst stellte Kapitän Lukas Hradecky auf das ganze Team und speziell auf Bakker, der vor wenigen Wochen noch aus dem Spieltagsaufgebot gegen Hertha BSC gestrichen worden war, weil er das Abschusstraining verpennt hatte, fest: ""Alle kleinen Dinge kommen zusammen. Er hat richtig reagiert auf seine Suspendierung. Heute hatte er drei oder vier Lungen. Wie viel er läuft und was er momentan für die Mannschaft tut, ist großartig. Heute war das nicht Europa-League-Niveau, sondern Champions-League-Niveau von ihm.""\nKomplettiert wurde die These, dass Bayer eine Spitzenmannschaft wird, von der Bedeutung von Florian Wirtz in dieser Partie. Lautete die Gleichung bislang: Nur wenn Wirtz stark ist, ist auch Bayer stark, so wurde auch dieses scheinbare Naturgesetz am Donnerstag außer Kraft gesetzt. So war Leverkusens Genie mal eben nicht die spielentscheidende Figur, erlaubte sich bei aller spielerischer Klasse auf engstem Raum und wichtigen Pässen, um dem belgischen Pressing zu entgehen, auch ungewohnte Ballverluste, wie den vor dem 1:3. Dass der Werksklub trotzdem so überzeugend auftrat, ist das letzte, aber vielleicht auch klarste Indiz dafür, dass Xabi Alonsos Arbeit zu etwas Großem führen kann.\nDer Trainer jedenfalls möchte in dem bisher Geleisteten trotz eines positiven Zwischenfazits nur einen Anfang sehen. ""Ich habe vom ersten Tag an gesagt, wenn wir fragil sind, wenn wir nicht wie eine Mannschaft zusammen verteidigen, dann ist das nicht möglich. Jetzt verteidigen wir gut, spielen kompakt und haben immer die Qualität, Chancen zu erspielen. Jetzt haben wir diese Entwicklung"", konstatierte Xabi Alonso, ""aber es ist zu früh, eine Saisonanalyse zu machen. Wir haben noch fünf, sechs Wochen, danach kann man noch besser analysieren."" Und noch viel mehr erreicht haben.\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

Es war die beste Leistung der Werkself in dieser Saison.\nDie BILD-Einzelkritik zum Viertelfinal-Rückspiel.\nLukas Hradecky: In der ersten Hälfte nicht geprüft. Machtlos beim Gegentor seines finnischen Landsmannes Kasper Terho. Sensationeller Reflex in der 75. Minute mitten in der Drangphase der Belgier. Note 2.\nEdmond Tapsoba: Der Burkiner stand sehr sicher und schaltete sich immer wieder gut mit ins Aufbauspiel ein. Wegen leichter muskulärer Beschwerden musste er früh raus. Note 2.\nJonathan Tah: So stark, so sicher, so gut – seine körperliche Präsenz war – wie im Hinspiel – beeindruckend. Sein Traumpass auf Azmoun kurz vor Schluss wäre die Krönung auf eine erneut sensationelle Vorstellung des Abwehrchefs gewesen. Tah ist in dieser Verfassung ganz klar wieder ein DFB-Kandidat. Note 1.\nPiero Hincapie: Hielt seine linke Seite weitestgehend dicht. Der Ecuadorianer kassierte kurz vor der Pause einen üblen Tritt von Lazare Amani auf die Wade, der mit der Roten Karte hätte bestraft werden müssen. Note 2.\n\nVortänzer: Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong und seine Kollegen feiern den Halbfinal-Einzug\nJeremie Frimpong: Ob vorne oder hinten – Frimpong war überall gleichzeitig, reagierte cool und nutzte seine Chance zum 3:0. Note 2.\nRobert Andrich: Wieder ein starker Auftritt des „emotionalen Leaders“ der Werkself, der längst eine Nominierung in der Nationalelf verdient hätte. Bei ihm merkte man in jeder Sekunde an, wie viel Lust er auf diese Nacht hatte. Note 2.\nNadiem Amiri: Dass er anstelle des angeschlagenen Exequiel Palacios beginnen würde, überraschte viele – wohl auch die Belgier. In der Offensive wenig Akzente, dafür enormer Einsatz für die Mannschaft. Note 3.\nMitchel Bakker: Ein Monster-Spiel des Niederländers. Volley-Abnahme zum 2:0, dann setzte er Union-Keeper Moris derart unter Druck, dass dieser Frimpong den Ball zum 3:0 „auflegte“. Auch das 4:1 leitete Bakker ein. Mehr geht nicht – bester Auftritt im Bayer-Trikot. Weltklasse. Note 1.\nMoussa Diaby: Der Franzose schoss das schnellste Europa-League-Tor der Saison. Auch an der Entstehung des zweiten und vierten Treffers entscheidend beteiligt. Note 2.\n\nFlorian Wirtz springt Mitchel Bakker auf den Rücken vor Freude\nAdam Hlozek: Stand überraschend in der Startelf und zahlte dieses Vertrauen eindrucksvoll zurück mit einer Super-Flanke auf Bakker zum 2:0 und seinem Abstauber zum 4:1, der das Spiel endgültig entschied. Note 2.\nFlorian Wirtz: Sorgte direkt für Unruhe in Unions Abwehr, was zum 1:0 durch Diaby führte. Sein Pass auf Diaby leitete den Traumkonter zum 2:0 ein. Aber: Sein Ballverlust führte auch zum Anschlusstreffer der Belgier. Die entscheidenden Szenen hatten diesmal andere, wobei sein kämpferischer Einsatz herausragend war. Note 3.\nKerem Demirbay (ab 59./für Amiri): Wie in den letzten Wochen mit einer guten Leistung. Er sorgte nach seiner Hereinnahme vor allem dafür, dass Bayer in der Druckphase der Belgier wieder die Kontrolle fand. Note 2.\n\nStolz auf seine Sieger: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nOdilon Kossounou (ab 59./für Tapsoba): Der Ivorer musste für den angeschlagenen Tapsoba die rechte Abwehrseite übernehmen, hatte in der Drangphase der Belgier auch einige Probleme, arbeitete sich aber von Minute zu Minute besser ins Spiel. Note 3.\nAmine Adli (ab 71./für Frimpong): Am Ende reichte es beim Franzosen zumindest für einen Joker-Einsatz, hatte kurz vor Schluss eine gute Schusschance. Note 3.\nSardar Azmoun (ab 86./für Hlozek): Der Iraner hatte in der Nachspielzeit zwei gute Möglichkeiten, vergab jedoch beide. Ohne Note.\nKarim Bellarabi (ab 86./für Diaby): Auch der Fan-Liebling bekam seine Chance, scheitert aber frei vor Torwart Moris. Ohne Note.\nXabi Alonso: Seine Mannschaft gewann über eine starke Defensive und effektive Offensive das Spiel deutlich. Kluge Wechsel in den richtigen Momenten brachten die Belgier in ihrer Drangphase aus dem Konzept. Sein Team ist seit zwölf Pflichtspielen unbesiegt, Alonsos Anteil an dieser Stabilität ist enorm.

"{'content': 'Der Traum vom Europa-League-Titel für Manchester United ist geplatzt. Die „Red Devils"" mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer mussten sich klar gegen den FC Sevilla geschlagen geben. Bayer Leverkusen zieht ins Halbfinale ein.\nFür Marcel Sabitzer und Manchester United ist der Traum vom Europa-League-Titel beim sechsfachen Rekordgewinner FC Sevilla geplatzt. Die späten Gegentore vom 2:2 im Heimhinspiel rächten sich am Donnerstag ebenso wie zwei peinliche Schnitzer, die Engländer unterlagen mit 0:3 (0:1) und müssen die anvisierte Champions-League-Qualifikation nun über die Premier League schaffen. Sevillas Halbfinalgegner am 11. und 18. Mai ist Juventus Turin, das die Hürde Sporting Lissabon nahm.\nMit Gernot Trauner (bis 106.) und Feyenoord Rotterdam musste sich ein weiterer ÖFB-Teamspieler verabschieden. In der Verlängerung gingen die Niederländer bei Salzburgs Zwischenrunden-Bezwinger AS Roma mit 1:4 (1:2,0:0) in die Knie. Die von Jose Mourinho trainierten Römer bekommen es nun mit Bayer Leverkusen zu tun, das nach einem 4:1 (2:0) über Union Saint-Gilloise Deutschlands letzte Hoffnung auf einen Europacuptitel ist.\nIn Sevilla bekam Sabitzer, nach einer leichten Blessur vor dem jüngsten Premier-League-Spiel rechtzeitig wieder fit geworden, die Motivation der Gastgeber gleich zu Beginn zu spüren. Kaum hatte man den Steirer nach einem Check an der Seitenlinie von Sevillas Ersatzbank ""geschält"", kam es aber wesentlich schlimmer für die Engländer. Harry Maguire, Eigentorschütze im Hinspiel, eröffnete dem aktuellen Tabellen-13. von La Liga mit einem kapitalen Rückpassfehler die Chance aufs 1:0, Youssef En-Nesyri nützte das trocken aus (8.).\nIm Gegensatz zum letztwöchigen Duell, als United nach schnellen Sabitzer-Toren es verabsäumte, einen klareren Erfolg gegen die lange handzahmen Spanier herauszuschießen, war Sevilla diesmal das tonangebende Team. Kurz vor der Pause zählte der nächste Treffer von Lucas Ocampos (42.) wegen Abseits\' aber nicht, quasi mit Wiederbeginn holte Sevilla das nach. Per Kopf und Unterlatte traf Loic Bade nach Corner zum 2:0 und damit zur Vorentscheidung. United legte in der Folge zwar zu, blieb aber ohne klare Chancen. Sabitzer machte in der 68. Minute Platz für Fred, im Finish schlug En-Nesyri nach schwerem Patzer von United-Goalie David DeGea ein weiteres Mal zu (81.).\nJuventus ging bei Sporting Lissabon, beflügelt von der Suspendierung der 15-Punkte-Abzugs in der Serie A Stunden davor, dank Adrien Rabiot (9.) in Führung, musste nach dem 1:0-Sieg im Hinspiel aber hart arbeiten. Denn die Portugiesen fanden durch den Foulelfer von Marcus Edwards (20.) die richtige Antwort und hatten durchaus noch Möglichkeiten auf den Führungstreffer zum 2:1, der sie zumindest in die Verlängerung gebracht hätte.\nDie AS Roma brauchte im Olympiastadion gegen Feyenoord genau eine Stunde, ehe Leonardo Spinazzola mit dem 1:0 das Hinspielergebnis egalisierte. Die Gäste wähnten sich im Finish dank ""Joker"" Igor Paixao (80.) bereits im Halbfinale, ehe Roma-Star Paulo Dybala (89.) mit dem 2:1 die Verlängerung erzwang. Dort wurden Stephan El Shaarawy (101.) und Lorenzo Pellegrini (108.) zu den Matchwinnern. Die Roma kann im Jahr nach dem Triumph in der Conference League nun auch vom Titel in der zweithöchsten Kategorie träumen.\nLeverkusen führte in Brüssel dank Traumstart durch Moussa Diaby (2.) und später Mitchel Bakker (37.) sowie Jeremie Frimpong (60.) mit 3:0 und ließ sich den Aufstieg nicht mehr nehmen. Zudem traf Adam Hlozek (79.) für die Deutschen, Casper Terho (65.) erzielte das Ehrentor für die Gastgeber.\nIn der Conference League kam AC Fiorentina zuhause dank zweier später Tore von Riccardo Sottil (78.) und Gaetano Castrovilli (92.) gegen Lech Posen von 0:3 noch auf 2:3 zurück und erreichte so mit dem Gesamtscore von 6:4 das Halbfinale, in dem der FC Basel wartet. OGC Nizza lag gegen die Schweizer durch Gaetan Laborde (9.) auf Aufstiegskurs, ließ sich im Finish das Glück aber noch entreißen. Jean-Kevin Augustin (86.) und Kasim Adams in der Verlängerung (98.) belohnten die Leistungssteigerung der Schweizer spät aber doch. Das Team von Ex-Sturm-Graz-Coach Heiko Vogel kam mit 2:1 und gesamt 4:3 weiter.\nAZ Alkmaar machte mit dem 2:0 nach 90 bzw. 120 Minuten gegen RSC Anderlecht das 0:2 aus dem Hinspiel wett und setzte sich im Elferschießen mit 4:1 durch. Die Niederländer treffen auf West Ham United, das nach 0:1-Rückstand gegen KAA Gent innerhalb von neun Minuten durch Lucas Paqueta (55.), Declan Rice (58.) und Michail Antonio (63.) die perfekte Wende schaffte und schließlich 4:1 bzw. gesamt 5:2 siegte.\n(APA)\nZum „Das Wichtigste des Tages“ Newsletter anmelden\nDer einzigartige Journalismus der Presse.

Die Werkself erreichte nach einer über weite Strecken schon titelreifen Leistung als einziger Fußball-Bundesligist das Halbfinale eines Europacup-Wettbewerbs und darf vom ersten Titel seit 30 Jahren träumen. ""Auf jeden Fall"" sei das ein ganz großer Tag, sagte Robert Andrich bei RTL und lobte die Anhänger: ""Ich bin sehr, sehr happy, dass wir das Ding heute gezogen haben.""\nZwei Tage nach dem Aus des FC Bayern München in der Champions League zog Bayer durch ein 4:1 (2:0) im Viertelfinal-Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise in die Vorschlussrunde der Europa League. Dort kommt es nun zum Duell mit dem ehemaligen Rudi-Völler-Club AS Rom und Star-Coach José Mourinho. Die Roma setzte sich dank eines 4:1 gegen Feyenoord Rotterdam nach Verlängerung durch.\nUmarmungen für die Bayern-Profis\nDas Hinspiel gegen den Tabellenzweiten aus Belgien, der in der Runde zuvor den 1. FC Union Berlin ausgeschaltet hatte, war 1:1 ausgegangen. Moussa Diaby brachte die Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso am Donnerstag in Brüssel nach 66 Sekunden in Führung, Mitchel Bakker (38.), Jeremie Frimpong (60.) und Adam Hlozek (79.) legten nach. Das Tor der Belgier erzielte Casper Terho (64.). Sportchef Simon Rolfes und Geschäftsführer Fernando Carro rannten nach dem Schlusspfiff und umarmten jeden Bayern-Profi einzeln. Nach dem 3:1 hätten sie ein bisschen geschwommen, mit dem vierten Tor aber den Deckel drauf gemacht, meinte Andrich.\nErst im Vorjahr hatte Eintracht Frankfurt die deutsche Wartezeit auf einen Titel im zweitwichtigsten Europacup nach 25 Jahren beendet. Leverkusen hatte den Vorgänger-Wettbewerb UEFA-Cup 1988 gewonnen, der letzte Bayer-Titel überhaupt war der Gewinn des DFB-Pokals im Jahr 1993. Zuletzt hatte Bayer vor 21 Jahren das Halbfinale eines Europacups erreicht. Damals stießen die Rheinländer sogar ins Endspiel der Champions League vor, verloren dieses aber mit 1:2 gegen Real Madrid.\nMehr Arbeit in der Defensive\nIm Lotto-Park, in dem normalerweise der RSC Anderlecht seine Heimspiele bestreitet, erwischte Bayer einen Traumstart. Senne Lynen fing den Doppelpass zwischen Florian Wirtz und Diaby eigentlich ab, spitzelte den Ball aber dadurch Diaby in den Fuß. Der französische Nationalspieler dribbelte Torhüter Anthony Moris aus und schob ein.\nDas schnelle Tor sorgte aber auch dafür, dass Bayer ohne den im Hinspiel verletzten Weltmeister Exequiel Palacios ab der zweiten Minute defensiv noch mehr Arbeit verrichten mussten. Die Belgier rannten mit all ihrer Körperlichkeit an, die Werkself stemmte sich dagegen und hoffte auf Konter. Die kamen durchaus und nach 16 Minuten hätte Diaby nach schönem Pass von Wirtz erhöhen können, verzog aber knapp. Sechs Minuten später trat Hlozek nach Hereingabe von Bakker am Ball vorbei.\nAcht Minuten vor der Pause spielte Bayer einen überragenden Angriff sehenswert zu Ende. Doppelpass von Diaby und Wirtz diesmal schon im Mittelfeld, Diaby zog auf, bediente Hlozek, dessen Flanke Bakker am langen Eck volley verwertete. Saint-Gilles kam bis zur Pause bestenfalls zu ein paar Halbchancen.\nTreffer ins leere Tor\nNach der Pause verstärkten die Gastgeber den Druck weiter, doch die Leverkusener Abwehr um den seit Wochen starken Jonathan Tah verteidigte leidenschaftlich und gewissenhaft. Bayer legte sogar wieder nach, als Bakker Moris erfolgreich bedrängte, der Torhüter den Ball in die Füße von Frimpong spielte und der ins leere Tor traf. Doch die Belgier gaben immer noch nicht auf und kamen zum Anschlusstreffer und trafen durch Simon Adingra die Latte (70.). Für Klarheit sorgte Bayers viertes Tor, per Abstauber traf Hlozek nach einem Schuss von Diaby.\nVergleichsportal\nGutscheine für Sport-Shops\n\n\n© G+J Medien GmbH\nZugang zu allen STERN PLUS-Inhalten und Artikeln aus dem Print-Magazin\nwerbefrei & jederzeit kündbar\nBereits registriert?'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

"{'content': 'Im Vorjahr gewann Frankfurt die Europa League, nun könnte Leverkusen den Titel wieder nach Deutschland holen. Durch ein 4:1 bei Saint-Gilles zieht die Werkself ins Halbfinale ein.\n20.04.2023, 23:20\xa0Uhr\nDie Leverkusener Profis tanzten vor ihren Fans, aus rund 30 Metern schaute Trainer Xabi Alonso voller Stolz zu. Deutschlands letzte Titel-Hoffnung in Europa heißt Bayer statt Bayern. Die Werkself erreichte nach einer über weite Strecken schon titelreifen Leistung als einziger Fußball-Bundesligist das Halbfinale eines Europacup-Wettbewerbs und darf vom ersten Titel seit 30 Jahren träumen. Zwei Tage nach dem Aus des FC Bayern München in der Champions League zog Bayer durch ein 4:1 (2:0) im Viertelfinal-Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise in die Vorschlussrunde der Europa League.\nDas Hinspiel gegen den Tabellenzweiten aus Belgien, der in der Runde zuvor den 1. FC Union Berlin ausgeschaltet hatte, war 1:1 ausgegangen. Moussa Diaby brachte die Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso am Donnerstag in Brüssel nach 66 Sekunden in Führung, Mitchel Bakker (38.), Jeremie Frimpong (60.) und Adam Hlozek (79.) legten nach. Das Tor der Belgier erzielte Casper Terho (64.). Sportchef Simon Rolfes und Geschäftsführer Fernando Carro rannten nach dem Schlusspfiff und umarmten jeden Bayern-Profi einzeln.\n„Auf jeden Fall“ sei das ein ganz großer Tag, sagte Robert Andrich bei RTL und lobte die Anhänger: „Ich bin sehr, sehr happy, dass wir das Ding heute gezogen haben.“ Nach dem 3:1 hätten sie ein bisschen geschwommen, mit dem vierten Tor aber den Deckel drauf gemacht.\nErst im Vorjahr hatte Eintracht Frankfurt die deutsche Wartezeit auf einen Titel im zweitwichtigsten Europacup nach 25 Jahren beendet. Leverkusen hatte den Vorgänger-Wettbewerb UEFA-Cup 1988 gewonnen, der letzte Bayer-Titel überhaupt war der Gewinn des DFB-Pokals im Jahr 1993. Zuletzt hatte Bayer vor 21 Jahren das Halbfinale eines Europacups erreicht. Damals stießen die Rheinländer sogar ins Endspiel der Champions League vor, verloren dieses aber mit 1:2 gegen Real Madrid.\nIm Lotto-Park, in dem normalerweise der RSC Anderlecht seine Heimspiele bestreitet, erwischte Bayer einen Traumstart. Senne Lynen fing den Doppelpass zwischen Florian Wirtz und Diaby eigentlich ab, spitzelte den Ball aber dadurch Diaby in den Fuß. Der französische Nationalspieler dribbelte Torhüter Anthony Moris aus und schob ein.\nDas schnelle Tor sorgte aber auch dafür, dass Bayer ohne den im Hinspiel verletzten Weltmeister Exequiel Palacios ab der zweiten Minute defensiv noch mehr Arbeit verrichten mussten. Die Belgier rannten mit all ihrer Körperlichkeit an, die Werkself stemmte sich dagegen und hoffte auf Konter. Die kamen durchaus und nach 16 Minuten hätte Diaby nach schönem Pass von Wirtz erhöhen können, verzog aber knapp. Sechs Minuten später trat Hlozek nach Hereingabe von Bakker am Ball vorbei.\nAcht Minuten vor der Pause spielte Bayer einen überragenden Angriff sehenswert zu Ende. Doppelpass von Diaby und Wirtz diesmal schon im Mittelfeld, Diaby zog auf, bediente Hlozek, dessen Flanke Bakker am langen Eck volley verwertete. Saint-Gilles kam bis zur Pause bestenfalls zu ein paar Halbchancen.\nNach der Pause verstärkten die Gastgeber den Druck weiter, doch die Leverkusener Abwehr um den seit Wochen starken Jonathan Tah verteidigte leidenschaftlich und gewissenhaft. Bayer legte sogar wieder nach, als Bakker Moris erfolgreich bedrängte, der Torhüter den Ball in die Füße von Frimpong spielte und der ins leere Tor traf. Doch die Belgier gaben immer noch nicht auf und kamen zum Anschlusstreffer und trafen durch Simon Adingra die Latte (70.). Für Klarheit sorgte Bayers viertes Tor, per Abstauber traf Hlozek nach einem Schuss von Diaby. (dpa)\nZur Startseite\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

"{'content': 'Die europäische Reise ist für Manchester United in dieser Saison zu Ende gegangen. Die „Red Devils“ verloren am Donnerstag mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer in der Startelf das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der UEFA Europa League beim FC Sevilla mit 0:3 (0:1). Nach dem 2:2 im Hinspiel machten sich die englischen Gäste mit Eigenfehlern wieder das Leben schwer. Gernot Trauner musste sich mit Feyenoord Rotterdam der AS Roma mit 1:4 n. V. beugen.\nIn Sevilla brachte der spanische ManUnited-Tormann David de Gea Harry Maguire in Bedrängnis, der Abwehrchef verlor unter Druck dreier Sevilla-Spieler den Ball, und am Ende vollendete Youssef En-Nesyri zur frühen Führung (8). Kurz nach der Pause erhöhte Loic Bade (47.), und En-Neysri traf nach einem Patzer von de Gea zum 3:0 (81.).\nSabitzer, der bis kurz vor Spielbeginn wegen einer Blessur fraglich war, wurde früh in der Partie ins Seitenaus gecheckt und musste behandelt werden. Trainer Erik ten Hag nahm ihn in der 68. vom Feld. Sevilla trifft nun im Halbfinale auf Juventus Turin, das nach einem 1:1 bei Sporting Lissabon (Hinspiel 1:0) in der Vorschlussrunde steht. Bayer Leverkusen (4:1 bei Union St. Gilloise, Hinspiel 1:1) musste länger warten, ehe der Gegner feststand: Die AS Roma setzte sich daheim gegen Feyenoord letztlich mit 4:1 nach Verlängerung (Hinspiel: 0:1) durch.\nManchester United ist aus dem Europacup ausgeschieden. Die „Red Devils“ verloren mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer in der Startelf das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der Europa League beim FC Sevilla mit 0:3 (0:1).\nIn Sevilla bekam Sabitzer, nach einer leichten Blessur vor dem jüngsten Premier-League-Spiel rechtzeitig wieder fit geworden, die Motivation der Gastgeber gleich zu Beginn zu spüren. Wenig später kam es noch wesentlich schlimmer für die Engländer. De Gea und Maguire, Eigentorschütze im Hinspiel, eröffneten dem aktuellen Tabellen-13. von La Liga die Chance aufs 1:0, Youssef En-Nesyri nützte das aus (8.).\nIm Gegensatz zum letztwöchigen Duell, als es United nach schnellen Sabitzer-Toren verabsäumte, einen klareren Erfolg gegen die lange handzahmen Spanier herauszuschießen, war Sevilla diesmal das tonangebende Team. Kurz vor der Pause zählte der nächste Treffer von Lucas Ocampos (42.) wegen Abseits aber nicht, quasi mit Wiederbeginn holte Sevilla das nach. Per Kopf und Unterlatte traf Loic Bade nach Corner zum 2:0 und damit zur Vorentscheidung. United legte in der Folge zwar zu, blieb aber ohne klare Chancen. Sabitzer machte in der 68. Minute Platz für Fred, im Finish schlug En-Nesyri nach schwerem Patzer von de Gea ein weiteres Mal zu (81.).\nDie AS Roma brauchte im Olympiastadion gegen Feyenoord eine Stunde, ehe Leonardo Spinazzola mit dem 1:0 das Hinspielergebnis egalisierte. Die Gäste wähnten sich im Finish dank „Joker“ Igor Paixao (80.) bereits im Halbfinale, ehe Roma-Star Paulo Dybala sich gegen Trauner durchsetzte und mit dem 2:1 (89.) die Verlängerung erzwang.\nDort wurden Stephan El Shaarawy (101.) und Lorenzo Pellegrini (108.) zu den Matchwinnern. Die Roma kann im Jahr nach dem Triumph in der Conference League nun auch vom Titel in der zweithöchsten Kategorie träumen. Im Halbfinale kommt es zum Duell mit Leverkusen.\nDie AS Roma setzte sich gegen Feyenoord Rotterdam (mit Gernot Trauner) mit 4:1 nach Verlängerung (Hinspiel: 0:1) durch.\nJuventus ging in Lissabon, beflügelt von der Suspendierung des 15-Punkte-Abzugs in der Serie A Stunden davor, dank Adrien Rabiot (9.) in Führung, musste nach dem 1:0 im Hinspiel aber hart arbeiten. Denn die Portugiesen fanden durch den Foulelfer von Marcus Edwards (20.) die richtige Antwort und hatten noch Chancen auf den Führungstreffer.\nDen Italienern reichte am Ende ein 1:1 bei Sporting Lissabon zum Aufstieg ins Halbfinale.\nLeverkusen führte in Brüssel dank Traumstarts durch Moussa Diaby (2.) und später Mitchel Bakker (37.) sowie Jeremie Frimpong (60.) mit 3:0 und ließ sich den Aufstieg nicht mehr nehmen. Zudem traf Adam Hlozek (79.) für die Deutschen, Casper Terho (65.) erzielte das Ehrentor.\nred, ORF.at/Agenturen'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

Bayer könnte gleich zwei Ziele erreichen.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtm-b7nea\nSpätestens wenn die zweite Hälfte des Aprils anbricht, beginnt im Fußball immer auch die Zeit der historischen Bezüge. Weil Halbfinals und Endspiele nahen, werden Erinnerungen an unvergessene Siege, an verpasste Chancen und an große Mannschaften lebendig, auch in Leverkusen ist das nicht anders. Der rheinische Werksklub hat an diesem Donnerstagabend (21.00 Uhr im F.A.Z.-Liveticker zur Europa League und bei RTL) in Brüssel im Duell mit Union Saint-Gilloise die Chance, zum vierten Mal in seiner Klubgeschichte das Halbfinale eines Europapokals zu erreichen.\nZuletzt vollbrachte Bayer 04 dieses Kunststück 2002, als die Reise der legendären Mannschaft um Michael Ballack, Lucio und Bernd Schneider über den Kontinent bis ins Champions-League-Finale gegen Real Madrid führte. „Es ist natürlich eine Riesenmotivation, dass wir zum ersten Mal seit 2002 wieder in das Halbfinale eines Europapokals kommen können“, sagt Sportdirektor Simon Rolfes, entsprechend entschlossen wird das Projekt angegangen.\nObwohl es auch in der Bundesliga um viel geht, schont Trainer Xabi Alonso regelmäßig an den Wochenenden wichtige Spieler, um auf internationalem Terrain möglichst starke Leistungen wahrscheinlicher zu machen. Zuletzt folgte er dieser Strategie beim 0:0 in Wolfsburg am Sonntag. Dort saßen mit Jonathan Tah, Amine Adli, Mitchel Bakker und vor allem Florian Wirtz vier Spieler auf der Bank, die in den wirklich wichtigen Partien meist zur Startelf zählen.\nDiese finden derzeit eben in der Europa League statt. Schließlich können hier mit einem Gewinn des Titels gleich zwei Ziele auf einmal erreicht werden: ein Erfolg für die Fußball-Ewigkeit und die Qualifikation für die kommende Champions-League-Spielrunde, die von zentraler Bedeutung für die mittelfristige Entwicklung des Klubs ist. „Wir haben eine Superchance“, sagt Alonso zu den Aussichten nach dem 1:1 im Viertelfinalhinspiel gegen die Belgier.\nWährend der vergangenen Jahrzehnte wurde dieser Wettbewerb unterhalb der geradezu kultisch verehrten Champions League in Deutschland nicht immer mit der angemessenen Wertschätzung betrachtet. Erst der Titelgewinn von Eintracht Frankfurt im vergangenen Jahr und die Einsicht, dass auch hier wirklich große Europapokalabende möglich sind, hat das Ansehen des Wettbewerbs grundlegend verändert.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nLeverkusen-Gegner Saint-Gilloise\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoker-Milliardär spielt „Moneyball“\nTrainer von Bayer Leverkusen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie beeindruckende Souveränität des Xabi Alonso\n0:0 in Wolfsburg\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBundesliga-Siegesserie der Leverkusener ist gerissen\nBayer Leverkusen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t„Ein Halbfinale gibt es nicht for free“\nUnd weil die Bedeutung der Europa League in der spanischen Heimat des Leverkusener Trainers Alonso schon viel früher erkannt worden ist, könnte sich nun eine interessante Kombination ergeben: In Leverkusen blüht die Hoffnung auf den zweiten europäischen Titel seit dem Erfolg im UEFA-Cup 1988, und der Trainer vermittelt die passende Haltung. „Jetzt Vollgas“, sagt Alonso mit Blick auf das Rückspiel gegen die zähen Belgier, die der Werkself in Leverkusen ein 1:1 abtrotzten. Die Zuversicht im Team ist groß, auch weil im Fußball das gern beschworene Momentum für den letzten Bundesligaklub im Wettbewerb spricht.\nNach dem schwachen Saisonstart gehören die Leverkusener zu den stärksten Teams in Deutschland, der Trainer ist endgültig im Klub angekommen, und Moussa Diaby sagt: „Bayer 04 hat die Spieler, um die Europa League zu gewinnen.“ Zudem ist Alonso, der zweimal die Champions League sowie die Weltmeisterschaft und ebenfalls zweimal die Europameisterschaft gewann, gut vertraut mit den Mechanismen sehr großer Spiele.\nUnd Wirtz, von dem die meisten Experten glauben, er habe eine Weltkarriere vor sich, kann jederzeit praktisch aus dem Nichts entscheidende Situationen hervorzaubern. So wie im Hinspiel gegen Saint-Gilloise, als er mit einem prachtvollen Schuss zum 1:1 traf. Es war schon sein siebtes Tor in der Europa League, seit dem großen Brasilianer Ronaldo Mitte der 1990er-Jahre hat kein Teenager mehr so viele Tore in diesem Wettbewerb geschossen. Was noch fehlt, sind allerdings die rauschhaften Europapokalabende, die die Würze einer großen Saison sind.\nWährend der SC Freiburg gegen Juventus Turin und Union Berlin gegen Ajax Amsterdam gespielt und eine tolle Gruppenphase erlebt haben, stolperte Bayer 04 im Herbst durch die Champions League. Das bisherige Leverkusener Highlight war der Sieg im Elfmeterschießen bei der AS Monaco, im atmosphärisch eher trostlosen Stadion Louis II an der Côte d’Azur, wo nur 8504 Zuschauer zugegen waren.\nWas den Erlebniswert betrifft, gibt es also noch Nachholbedarf. Sollte Bayer Leverkusen nun allerdings im Brüsseler Stadtteil Anderlecht die nächste Runde erreichen, wäre ein besonderes Erlebnis sicher: Gegner im vierten Halbfinale eines Europacups für Leverkusen nach 1988, 1995 und 2002 wäre entweder der souveräne niederländische Tabellenführer Feyenoord Rotterdam oder der letztjährige Conference-League-Sieger AS Rom mit Trainer José Mourinho.\nQuelle: F.A.Z.\nHier können Sie die Rechte an diesem Artikel erwerben.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtm-b7nea\nWeitere Themen\nKritik an DFL und Leverkusen\n                                \n: \n\nÄrger beim 1.

Er tat es trotz konkreter Angebote bisher nicht, denn neben seinen sportlichen Qualitäten auf dem Platz, machen\xa0den Kroaten vor allem seine Treue und Loyalität zu seinem Verein besonders -\xa0in einer Zeit, in der es fast normal geworden ist, dass sich Spieler aus ihren Verträgen ""freipressen"" und ihre Vereine unter Druck setzen, sie bei einem vermeintlich besseren Angebot ziehen zu lassen. Borna Sosa ist da anders.\nSeit der Saison 2018/2019 spielt Borna Sosa (l.) für den VfB Stuttgart\n""Mir ist wichtig: Wenn ich gehe, dann soll auch der VfB Stuttgart froh und glücklich sein"", sagte Sosa Ende Februar in einem Interview mit dem TV-Sender Sky. ""Ich möchte nicht wechseln, wenn das Angebot für mich und für den Klub nicht top ist. Ich werde keinen Druck machen, dass man mich gehen lassen muss. Ich bin fünf Jahre hier. Der Verein ist sehr wichtig für mich. Daher sollen alle glücklich sein, wenn der Zeitpunkt für einen Wechsel kommt.""\nOb man beim VfB tatsächlich ""glücklich"" sein wird, wenn Sosa im Sommer wirklich wechseln sollte? Immerhin kann man sich sicher sein, dass man nicht mit leeren Händen dasteht. Schließlich läuft Sosas Vertrag noch bis 2025. Eine entsprechend hohe Ablösesumme wäre daher fällig, mit der sich die über den sportlichen Verlust sicher unglücklichen Stuttgarter trösten könnten.\nMöglicherweise bleibt Sosa sogar in der Bundesliga. In der vergangenen Winter-Transferperiode hatte ein Wechsel zu Bayer 04 Leverkusen schon weite Fortschritte gemacht. ""Es war konkret"", bestätigte Sosa bei Sky. ""Leverkusen wollte mich verpflichten. Es war in der letzten Phase, aber die Klubs mussten eine Absprache treffen und das war nicht der Fall.""\nBei der WM in Katar wurde Borna Sosa (r.) mit der kroatischen Mannschaft WM-Dritter\nGut möglich, dass der Werksklub es im Sommer erneut versucht. Schließlich ist die Position links hinten im Team Xabi Alonsos mit Mitchel Bakker und Daley Sinkgraven derzeit nicht herausragend besetzt. Aber es gibt auch Angebote aus dem Ausland: Real Sociedad und der FC Sevilla aus Spanien und Tottenham Hotspur aus der englischen Premier League sollen Interesse bekundet haben.\nSosa ist zwar in Kroatiens Hauptstadt Zagreb geboren, hat aber enge Verbindungen nach Deutschland und besitzt seit einiger Zeit neben der kroatischen auch die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft. Sein Großvater war einst aus Jugoslawien nach Deutschland ausgewandert und nach Ulm, südöstlich von Stuttgart gezogen. Sosas Mutter ist dort geboren und später wieder zurück nach Kroatien gegangen. Als Kind war Borna Sosa oft in Deutschland bei den Großeltern.\nMit der U19 von Dinamo Zagreb spielte Borna Sosa (r.) in der UEFA Youth League\nSeine fußballerische Ausbildung hat Sosa, der mit Kroatien bei der WM in Katar Dritter wurde, bei Dinamo Zagreb genossen, einer herausragenden Adresse im europäischen Nachwuchsfußball. Kroatiens erfolgreichster Fußballverein ist mit seiner A-Junioren-Mannschaft regelmäßig in der UEFA Youth League dabei. Viele ehemalige Nachwuchsspieler Dinamos spielen mittlerweile in den großen europäischen Ligen. In der Bundesliga sind neben Sosa die beiden Leipziger Dani Olmo und Josko Gvardiol zwei weitere Beispiele.\nNun könnte für Sosa bald der nächste Schritt folgen. ""Natürlich will ich im Europapokal spielen"", sagte Sosa im Februar. ""Ich denke, dass möchte jeder Spieler, aber vorher habe ich noch ein Ziel: dass Stuttgart in der Bundesliga bleibt."" Mit dem Punktgewinn gegen Borussia Dortmund ist Stuttgart dem Klassenerhalt zumindest einen kleinen Schritt nähergekommen. Sechs Spiele bleiben dem VfB und Sosa bis zum Saisonende noch, um es vollends zu schaffen.\nUnd außerdem gibt es noch den DFB-Pokal: Sollten die Stuttgarter sich Anfang Mai im Halbfinale gegen Eintracht Frankfurt durchsetzen und anschließend auch das Endspiel gegen den SC Freiburg oder RB Leipzig gewinnen, hätte Borna Sosa sein Ziel erreicht. Er wäre im Europapokal dabei - ganz ohne einen Wechsel weg vom VfB Stuttgart.\n---------\nVfB Stuttgart - Borussia Dortmund 3:3 (0:2)\nTore:\xa00:1 Haller (26.), 0:2 Malen (33.), 1:2 Coulibaly (78.), 2:2 Vagnoman (84.), 2:3 Reyna (90.+2), 3:3 Silas (90.+7)\nGelb-rote Karte:\xa0Mavropanos (Stuttgart/39.)\nZuschauer: 47.900\nDem erfolgsverwöhnten Rekordmeister FC Bayern drohen innerhalb kurzer Zeit die Saisonziele zu entgleiten.

Gegen Union Saint-Gilloise gab es ein 1:1.\nLeverkusen.\xa0Dank Florian Wirtz hat Bayer Leverkusen noch alle Chancen auf den Einzug ins Halbfinale der Europa League. Beim 1:1 (0:0) im Viertelfinal-Hinspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise rettete der Nationalspieler mit seinem Treffer acht Minuten vor Schluss zumindest das Remis. Dennoch steht Bayer im Rückspiel in einer Woche in Anderlecht vor einer Menge Arbeit, denn am Donnerstag biss sich die Werkself am belgischen Außenseiter wie schon Union Berlin im Achtelfinale über weite Strecken die Zähne aus.\nGegner im vierten Halbfinale eines Europacups für Leverkusen nach 1988, 1995 und 2002 wäre entweder der souveräne niederländische Tabellenführer Feyenoord Rotterdam oder der letztjährige Conference-League-Sieger AS Rom mit Trainer José Mourinho. Das Hinspiel gewann Rotterdam zu Hause mit 1:0. Den Führungstreffer für die Belgier hatte der Nigerianer Victor Boniface erzielt (51.), der schon in der Runde zuvor gegen den Bundesliga-Dritten aus Berlin zwei Treffer erzielt und einen vorbereitet hatte.\nWie groß die Euphorie in Leverkusen rund um dieses Spiel war, zeigte sich zwei Stunden vor dem Anpfiff. Einige Tausend Fans hatten den Mannschaftsbus empfangen. Nur mit Mühe konnte sich der Bus den Weg durch die Fans bahnen, eingehüllt in eine Nebelwolke von zahlreichen Pyros. Doch die nur auf einer Position veränderte Bayer-Elf wirkte zunächst eher nervös und fahrig, fabrizierte gegen die robusten Belgier in der Anfangsphase ungewöhnlich viele Abspielfehler. Als erster kleiner Brustlöser diente ein Konter in der 7. Minute, bei dem Amine Adli seinen Kollegen Wirtz schnell bediente und der aus 18 Metern knapp verzog.\nEinen kurzen Schockmoment erlebten die Gastgeber in der siebten Minute, als Torhüter Lukas Hradecky sich entweder verschätzte oder ein extrem gutes Auge hatte. Einen harmlosen Aufsetzer von Lazare Amani wollte er über das Tor springen lassen, doch der Ball landete auf der Latte (13.). Eine Viertelstunde später musste Hradecky bei einem Schrägschuss von Boniface dann richtig eingreifen.\nNach der anschließenden Ecke hatte Leverkusen gleich doppelt Glück. Zunächst prallte der Ball vom Arm von Jonathan Tah an die Unterkante der Latte, dann entschied der Video-Schiedsrichter nach Ansicht der Bilder, dass das Handspiel nicht elfmeterreif war. Nun mehrten sich die Torchancen, auch für die Werkself. Doch Moussa Diaby verzog zweimal knapp (30./45.+1), Piero Hincapié köpfte bei der größten Gelegenheit am langen Pfosten aus zwei Metern und spitzem Winkel daneben (40.). Insgesamt bekämpften die Belgier die Stärken des Bundesligisten aber gut. Beispielhaft dafür war es, dass Jeremie Frimpong und Diaby auf Bayers starker rechter Seite ihre Schnelligkeit kaum ausspielen konnten.\nUnd dann fiel das Tor tatsächlich auf der Gegenseite, als der starke Boniface den Ball aus zehn Metern ins lange Eck schlenzte. Bayer rannte nun an, aber zunehmend wild und hektisch, was die disziplinierten Gäste selten vor große Probleme stellte. In der Schlussphase gelang dann aber doch der erlösende Ausgleichstreffer, als Wirtz mit einem Distanzschuss genau zielte.'}",Mitchel Bakker,de

Mein Kopf will mehr. Wir haben diesen großen Wunsch für das Rückspiel. Und wir bleiben optimistisch.""\nDer belgische Außenseiter, der im Achtelfinale den Bundesliga-Dritten Union Berlin rausgeworfen hatte, untermauerte am Donnerstag in Leverkusen seinen Ruf als unbequemer, ekliger und schwer zu schlagender Gegner. Nachdem Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz (82.) nach dem Rückstand durch Victor Boniface (51.) das Remis gerettet hatte, konnte Alonso das Ganze aber positiv betrachten: ""Das war eine gute Vorbereitung auf nächste Woche.""\nFreilich musste Alonso zugeben, dass sich die Ausgangslage nicht verbessert hat. ""Gestern standen die Chancen 50:50. Jetzt haben wir unentschieden gespielt und sie haben das zweite Spiel daheim. Daher haben sie vielleicht einen kleinen Vorteil"", sagte der zweimalige Champions-League-Sieger als Spieler und dachte wohl an die Berliner, die nach einem 3:3 zu Hause in Belgien mit 0:3 verloren. ""Aber es sind noch mindestens 90 Minuten zu spielen"", sagte Alonso: ""Es wird wie ein Finale. Make or break. Und wir sind bereit dafür.""\nÄhnlich sah es Torschütze Wirtz. ""Wir hätten uns eine bessere Ausgangslage gewünscht"", sagte der 19-Jährige: ""Aber ich bin sicher, dass wir im Rückspiel gewinnen werden. Wir haben eine richtig geile Mannschaft.

Un error de Maguire propició el 1-0 de En Nesyri a los ocho minutos mientras que Badé dobló la renta al poco de la reanudación, en un remate con el hombro que tocó el larguero y se coló en la red de David de Gea. El meta español regaló también el tercero al marroquí, superados los ingleses desde el aviso que les dejó Old Trafford.\nEl United, con hasta cinco bajas en su habitual once, fue engullido por la mística continental de un Sevilla que hace suya esta Liga Europa, como en el tramo final en Mánchester para hacer un 2-2 de la nada. José Luis Mendilibar, en el banquillo andaluz desde hace un mes, ha dado las armas para resucitar a un equipo que muerde arriba, aprovecha sus ocasiones y es fuerte atrás.\nEl cuadro local, espoleado por el ambiente de las grandes noches, lanzó la presión y recogió sus frutos ante Maguire. El internacional inglés se vio rodeado y En Nesyri aprovechó el mano a mano con De Gea (1-0). El equipo de Ten Hag tardó 20 minutos en volver en sí, con buenas carreras de Antony y pocas de Sancho para paliar la ausencia de un cerebro como Bruno Fernandez, pero sin remate.\nPese a la lesión de Marcao, el Sevilla supo mandar y defenderse cuando tocó, para llegar a hacer el 2-0 antes del descanso. El duelo se volvió, con ese tanto de Ocampos que fue anulado por milímetros, en un ida y vuelta que volvió a encender al Pizjuán. El equipo de ‘Mendi’ tenía la sartén por el mango y lució pegada a los dos minutos de la segunda parte con el remate de Badé.\nEn un saque de esquina de un Rakitic mariscal durante todo el encuentro, el defensor francés firmó un remate parabólico con el hombro que hizo enloquecer al Pizjuán (2-0). Ten Hag había metido ya al ‘tocado’ Rashford tras el paso por vestuarios, pero la empresa inglesa se antojaba imposible por juego y sensaciones.\n‘Mendi’ quería más control, pero el corazón iba por su cuenta en un Sevilla que no dejó de apretar y buscar el tercero. Weghorst fue la otra opción de Ten Hag, pero los locales eclipsaron a un United con mucha menos fe. La defensa ‘red devil’ la sacó en boca de gol, Navas frenó a Rashford y, en otro arreón, llegó el 3-0 de En Nesyri tras un grave error de De Gea a 10 minutos del final.\nLa Juventus, otro grande que tendrá que pasar por el Pizjuán, se puede dar por avisada. El Sevilla, en un año de penurias, no renuncia a su leyenda. El efecto Mendilibar se ve en competición doméstica, saliendo finalmente de la zona baja, y en la Liga Europa recupera el club su mejor versión, favorito a un séptimo título.\n\nCrédito: SportsCenter\nEl Sporting de Portugal y el Juventus de Turín empataron este jueves (1-1) en Lisboa en el partido de vuelta de los cuartos de la Liga Europa de fútbol, por lo que el triunfo por 1-0 en la ida garantizó a la “Vecchia Signora” el pase a la siguiente ronda de la competición.\nDespués de que el Oporto y el Benfica cayeran a manos del Inter de Milán en la Liga de Campeones y de que el Braga fuera eliminado por el Fiorentina en la Liga de Conferencia, ahora le tocó al Sporting caer ante un cauteloso Juventus, que sufrió para eliminar a los portugueses.\nEn Lisboa, el partido se decantó mayoritariamente hacia los locales, con momentos de intensa presión, pero sin hacer mella en los de Massimiano Allegri, bien organizados defensivamente y sin duda felices tras haber recuperado temporalmente los 15 puntos que les fueron retirados en la Serie A.\nLos “leones”, alentados por la mayor afluencia de público a su estadio esta temporada, arrancaron bien el partido, pero no tardó en caer un balde de agua helada sobre la capital portuguesa gracias al gol del Juventus en el minuto 9.\nTras un córner, el titubeo de los defensas del Sporting creó una oportunidad para que Rabiot marcara el tanto inicial del partido y aumentara el grado de dificultad para los lusos.\nEl gol del francés permitió a Massimiliano Allegri poner a su Juve a hacer lo que mejor sabe, bajar sus líneas para conservar la ventaja, pero la rapidez del inglés Marcus Edwards obligó al experimentado técnico a replantearse su estrategia.\nEn un momento del partido en el que el Sporting presionaba más, Edwards corrió por la banda derecha de forma supersónica y asistió a Trincão, que envió el balón al poste.\nLa jugada continuó con el uruguayo Manuel Ugarte, una de las grandes figuras de la primera parte, que al llegar al rechace fue placado por Rabiot en el área, lo que llevó a Edwards, aún a mil por hora, al punto de penalti, desde donde empató a los 20.\nLa “Vechia Signora”, acampada en su campo, realizó pocas visitas a la portería defendida por el madrileño Antonio Adán, pero las que efectuó causaron cierto peligro, debido a alguna desconexión defensiva del equipo verdiblanco.\nEl mayor quebradero de cabeza para los turineses fue Ugarte, omnipresente en el campo y una auténtica pesadilla para Chiesa o Di María, al igual que el japonés Morita, que repitió su brillante actuación en Italia.\nPero fue en una pérdida de Morita cuando el Juventus estuvo cerca del segundo, que no llegó porque el centro de Juan Cuadrado fue demasiado rápido y raso para que Vlahovic, solo ante la portería, lo rematase bien.\nComo en el partido de ida, el Sporting tuvo algunos problemas de definición. A ello no ayudó un muro juventino compuesto por dos viejos conocidos, los brasileños Alex Sandro y Danilo, que vistieron la camiseta del Oporto durante muchos años.\nA medida que el cronómetro avanzaba, el Juventus recurrió a las lecciones más arraigadas del “Calcio” para estar con un pie en semifinales, aunque no con la misma cohesión de antaño.\nUn ejemplo de ello fue la distracción de Danilo, que dejó al lateral Esgaio solo delante de Szczesny y con el empate en sus pies, pero éste disparó demasiado fuerte.\nMientras los turineses echaron mano de su experiencia, los lisboetas fueron a por todas e incluso Sebastián Coates se sumó al ataque.\nEl veterano central uruguayo fue el que más cerca estuvo del gol en los últimos instantes -y en todo el partido-, y sus fallos sumieron en la desesperación a los aficionados verdiblancos.\nEl Sporting se despidió de la Europa League con la sensación de que podía haber hecho más, después de que dos errores en los dos partidos le pasaran factura.\nA su vez, el pragmatismo y la experiencia del Juventus le bastaron para seguir en la competición y para poder dar un vuelco a su inusual temporada.\nCrédito: ESPN\nPaulo Dybala resucitó este jueves al Roma con un tanto fundamental en los últimos compases que alargó el partido hasta la prórroga, en la que guió a los suyos a la victoria ante el Feyenoord (4-1, 4-2 global) y a las semifinales de la Liga Europa de fútbol, en las que se medirá al Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nPaulo Dybala volvió a ser la pieza clave del Roma. No hay mucho más misterio en la noche europea del jueves en la capital italiana. El Roma parecía muerto, desahuciado con el tanto de Paixao, pero revivió de la mano de un Dybala que, a medio gas, tocado todavía de la lesión que sufrió en la ida, volvió a conducir al éxito a los de Mourinho.\nSufrió el conjunto ‘giallorroso’ sin su estrella en la primera mitad. El Roma empezó motivado, intenso, acompañado por un Estadio Olímpico lleno, incluida la parte visitante por la prohibición de entrada a los aficionados neerlandeses, que intimidó en los primeros instantes, pero falto de lucidez en los metros finales. La que pone siempre Dybala.\nY es que muy consciente de la importante baja de su rival, el Feyenoord en defensa fue un cerrojo. Juntó la línea de defensa y la del centro del campo y complicó sobremanera el tránsito por el carril central, obligando a los de Mourinho a lanzar el largo constantemente, un remedio que apenas surtió efecto.\nSolo la calidad de Spinazzola por la izquierda generaba espacios que luego el propio carrilero desestimaba con centros desacertados. Matic exhibió su calidad en acciones defensivas todo el partido, imperial minimizando al máximo los ataques rivales.\nEl efecto estadio fue desapareciendo a medida que el Feyenoord fue asentándose. Un disparo de Cristante que rozó el palo, una contra mal gestionada entre Belotti y Pellegrini y un disparo de El Shaarawy fueron lo más destacado en ataque de una ‘Loba’ que, además de verse incapaz en metros finales, sufrió la lesión de Wijnaldum.\nA todo esto, el Feyenoord llevó el partido a su terreno. Pérdidas de tiempo desde el minuto 1, faltas para cortar el ritmo y tanganas para sacar de quicio a los italianos surtieron el efecto deseado. No se jugaba con regularidad.\nLos neerlandeses fueron creciendo paulatinamente basándose en esa solidez defensiva y a raíz de la ocasión más clara del partido. Una gran combinación en el centro del campo que acabó con un centro que remató potente Szymanski directo a puerta, justo al sitio en el que estaba un Rui Patricio que se encontró el balón y lo desechó a bocajarro.\nEl segundo acto comenzó igual que el primero, con un arreón de los locales que desembocó en remate al palo de Pellegrini. El estadio empezó a creer y tras una respuesta neerlandesa, llegó el ansiado gol romanista. Spinazzola, clave en el éxito de este equipo, remachó un balón suelto e incendió, más todavía, el partido.\nLas piernas de los jugadores del Feyenoord empezaron a temblar. Las de los del Roma volvieron a estar frescas. El conjunto de Róterdam empezó a desconfiar, a tener dudas de la que había sido hasta el momento una salida de balón perfecta que derivó en una imprecisa. El gol lo cambió todo.\nLa entrada de Dybala fue un plus añadido que volcó el choque aún más hacia la meta defendida por Bijlow. Incluso Cristante puso el 2-0 en el marcador, pero el colegiado anuló el tanto por una falta previa clara de Abraham.\nPero lo que parecía ir en una dirección cambió radicalemente con la lesión de Smalling, líder absoluto de la zaga ‘giallorossa’. Sin él, el Roma fue más débil atrás. Y el Feyenoord sacó el máximo rédito posible cuando estaba contra las cuerdas. Paixao remató libre de marca y anotó el empate a uno. Se hizo el silencio en el Olímpico.\nEl problema del Feyenoord fue el mismo que el otros tantos equipos que pasan por la capital italiana. Tiene nombre y apellidos. Es Paulo Dybala. La ‘Joya’ no falla en los momentos grandes desde su llegada a Roma. Un buen control dentro del área le bastó para hacer sangre, para reenganchar a la afición y para llevar el partido a la prórroga.\nPasó de todo en el tiempo suplementario. La tuvo el Feyenoord clarísima en botas de Giménez. Dybala asustó con una recaída, visiblemente molesto, pero se recuperó para poner un córner a la cabeza de Ibáñez que acabó en la madera. El partido se rompió ante el desgaste físico, y entre idas y venidas llegó la sentencia. Pellegrini encontró a Abraham en el área y el ariete hizo lo propio con El Shaarawy.\nPero no se quedó ahí el encuentro. Otra vez Dybala fue la fórmula de la felicidad. Pase de oro a Abraham que el ariete estrella en el meta pero cuyo rechace recogió Pellegrini para poner el 4-1 definitivo con suspense por la revisión del VAR.\nEl Roma es Dybala y diez más. El campeón del mundo llevó a los suyos a las semifinales, en las que se medirá al Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nCrédito: ESPN\nUn arranque contundente ante un rival inexperto condicionado por la presión facilitó la victoria en Bruselas (1-4) del Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso, que se situó en las semifinales de la Liga Europa y acabó con el equipo revelación del Viejo Continente, que, cuando recuperó el desparpajo y quiso reaccionar, ya tenía la clasificación muy cuesta arriba.\nEl Union St. Gilloise belga ha sido la sensación de la Liga Europa. Sin bagaje en este tipo de competición estuvo a un paso de situarse entre los cuatro mejores del torneo. Afrontó la cita como local con un buen marcador obtenido en el choque de ida, empate a un tanto que complicaba la tarea del Leverkusen.\nPero el equipo germano impuso su ley desde el principio. Refuerza a Xabi Alonso la situación del Bayer. Cuando el preparador español llegó al BayArena el equipo estaba en descenso en la Bundesliga y con un pie fuera de la Liga de Campeones. Ahora, meses después, el cuadro de Leverkusen está en la parte alta de la clasificación alemana y es aspirante al título de la Liga Europa, a la que llegó como tercero de su grupo en la ‘Champions’ y dejó fuera al Atlético Madrid.\nEl conjunto de Xabi ya lleva doce partidos sin perder. Empezó a fraguar la victoria a los dos minutos, en una acción que nació en una conducción de Florian Witz que terminó con un balón dividido entre Adam Hlozek y el defensa Senne Lynen que acabó en los pies de Moussa Diaby, que superó al meta Anthony Moris.\nEl equipo de Karel Geraerts ni siquiera había asimilado la situación y Jeremie Frimpong pudo hacer el segundo a los veinte minutos. Pero llegó a siete del descanso, en una transición que inició Diaby, que centró al checo Adam Hlozek y culminó el neerlandés Mitchel Bakker.\nTras el descanso el encuentro se desató. Marcó el tercero que sentenció el choque Jeremie Frimpong, vivo ante el error garrafal del portero Moris ante la presión de Bakker.\nFue entonces, con todo perdido, cuando despertó el St. Gilloise. Acortó distancias enseguida, cinco minutos después, en el 65, en una estupenda jugada por la izquierda, robo incluido, de Loic Lapoussin que terminó con un centro al área que recogió el finlandés Casper Terho, que amagó, tiró y marcó.\nDespués pudo hacer el segundo Victor Boniface de cabeza y a continuación Simon Adingra tiró a un palo. Pudieron ser el segundo y el St. Gilloise, a la desesperada, reengancharse al duelo. Pero fue al contrario.\nA diez minutos del cierre un tiro de Diaby que rechazó el portero Anthony Moris fue recogido y aprovechado por el checo Adam Hlozek, que hizo el cuarto, hundió del todo al representante de Bélgica y llevó a semifinales al Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nAvenida Italia 850, Providencia, Santiago. \n+56 9 6919 6517 info@elmostrador.cl'}",Mitchel Bakker,es

Germany’s top four qualify for Europe’s premier competition.\nIt was a typical battling performance from Union, and one goal was enough to clinch the team’s 16th win of the season.\nUnion defender Jerome Roussillon lobbed a cross over the Gladbach defense and Becker allowed it to drop before meeting the ball with his right boot to send it inside the left post.\nUnion coach Urs Fischer took the exhausted Becker off with just under a quarter-hour remaining, giving the Suriname winger an affectionate hug and bringing a smile to his face with whatever he said in his ear.\nUnion next faces in-form Bayer Leverkusen in Köpenick on Saturday.\n“In the Bundesliga you get absolutely no presents,” Fischer said. “We’re on a good path, but nothing is settled yet.”\nLEVERKUSEN RUN CONTINUES\nLeverkusen is reaping the benefit of Xabi Alonso’s coaching.\nLeverkusen showed its resilient side with a 2-0 win over direct rival Leipzig, which dropped out of the top four.\nGoals from Adam Hlozek and a late penalty from Nadiem Amiri secured Leverkusen’s win and stretched its unbeaten run to 13 games across all competitions.\nIt’s been a remarkable turnaround.\nLeverkusen was second from bottom in the Bundesliga with just five points from the opening eight rounds when former Spain star Alonso was appointed coach in place of the fired Gerardo Seoane.\nLeipzig played well for long periods but found no answer to the home team’s resolute defending or ability to surge forward thanks to the speed of its attackers.\nHlozek scored five minutes before the break when Robert Andrich played a perfectly weighted through ball for Moussa Diaby to race onto on the right. Diaby whipped in a cross behind Leipzig’s defenders for the incoming Hlozek to side-foot inside the left post.\nHlozek was playing in place of Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz, watching from the stands after complaining of stomach problems.\nTimo Werner, Dominik Szoboszlai and Christopher Nkunku all went close for Leipzig, which pushed hard for an equalizer until Szoboszlai conceded the penalty in the 85th for bringing down Jeremie Frimpong. Amiri duly sealed the result from the spot.\n“To win like (we did) today is not easy,“ Alonso said. “We’re not used to it. But our mentality and experience helped us. I’m very proud of the team.”\nLeverkusen hasn’t lost a game since a 3-2 defeat at home to Mainz on Feb. 19. On Thursday it reached the Europa League semifinals with a 4-1 win at Union Saint-Gilloise.\nEarlier, Freiburg strengthened its case for Champions League qualification with a 4-0 rout of relegation-threatened Schalke. Michael Gregoritsch scored twice for the home team to move fourth.\nLeverkusen is six points behind Freiburg.\nOn Saturday, Mainz defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 to give Borussia Dortmund the chance to take over as league leader.

"{'content': 'Slick Sevilla punish slapdash Man United to ease into Europa semis\n\nEuropa League kings Sevilla breezed past Manchester United into the semi-finals of their favourite competition as Youssef En Nesyri scored twice in a dominant 3-0 win on Thursday that secured a 5-2 aggregate triumph.\nBoth En Nesyri\'s goals came from mistakes by United goalkeeper David de Gea while trying to play the ball with his feet and it was a listless and error-strewn performance by the English side.\nSevilla were relentless with their high pressing and United, who led the first leg 2-0 before conceding two late goals at Old Trafford, never threatened to get back into the game amid a raucous atmosphere at a sold-out Sanchez Pizjuan stadium.\n""I have never seen an atmosphere like this in my entire life,"" En Nesyri told Movistar Plus.\n""I am very happy for the two goals and for the fans who supported us until the end.\n""We have to stay together, with the fans, because that\'s how we\'ll go far.""\n\nLanguishing in the bottom half of LaLiga during a difficult season in which two managers have been fired, Sevilla rediscovered their mojo at Old Trafford to grab a late 2-2 draw.\nIt took only eight minutes for Sevilla to open the scoring after De Gea delivered a hospital pass to Harry Maguire who was challenged by Erik Lamela and En Nesyri scooped up the loose ball to net from close range.\nSevilla wasted several chances and Lucas Ocampos had a goal ruled out by VAR due to offside in the build-up shortly before halftime.\nUnited manager Erik ten Hag brought on Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw as halftime substitutes but straight after the interval Sevilla defender Loic Bade scored with a towering header from a corner which went in off the crossbar.\nEn Nesyri wrapped up the win in the 81st minute after United goalkeeper David De Gea failed to deal with a long ball over the top and the Morocco striker finished well to move the Spanish side closer to a record-extending seventh victory in the competition.\n""We have to do better, that\'s the demand,"" Ten Hag told BT Sport.\n""We were not composed, not calm. We didn\'t beat the press, when you do there are so many spaces behind, and it was obvious at the start how to do it.\n""We lost the battles, they had more passion, more desire, more willingness. This was a great opportunity, a great occasion, to win something and we gave it away - we have to blame ourselves.

We have limits, but this team is a family.""\nAfter Feyenoord had won the quarter-final first leg 1-0, Roma pushed for the opening goal from the start, missing two great opportunities in the first 10 minutes.\nThe visitors became more involved in the match, with Roma keeper Rui Patricio forced to deny Sebastian Szymanski from close range.\nImmediately after halftime, Roma had an excellent chance when a cross found Pellegrini at the near post but his shot hit the post.\n""I have to say that the emotions started before the match. You know you have to win for these people who give everything for us – and, consequently, we have to give everything for them,"" Pellegrini said.\nOn the hour mark, roars of relief erupted around the Stadio Olimpico when Leonardo Spinazzola took advantage of a deflection in the box to poke the ball into the bottom corner.\nMourinho started with key players Paulo Dybala and Abraham on the bench, after they suffered injuries early in the first leg, but he sent them on midway through the second half to chase a decider.\nIn the 80th minute, Brazilian Igor Paixao headed in an equaliser for the visitors, unmarked inside the box from a cross by Szymanski, only for Dybala to level the aggregate score one minute before stoppage time with a shot from a tricky angle.\nFeyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez received a straight red card in the game\'s final moments for a knee-high tackle on Gianluca Mancini.\n""I am never angry when we don’t do well, because I know these players gave everything.

But overall we did it very well.\n""Now the team is ready to fight in a semi-final. We are a step closer to reaching the final but I\'ll only talk about the semi-final,"" said the Spaniard.\nLeverkusen, who face AS Roma in the last four, proved extremely efficient, needing just 66 seconds for Diaby to round keeper Anthony Moris and finish a quick move by the Germans to open the scoring.\nThey added another goal on the break in the 38th with Mitchel Bakker volleying in at the far post before they were gifted a third on the hour courtesy of a big Moris blunder.\nUnder pressure from Bakker, the keeper sent the ball straight into the path of Jeremie Frimpong who only had to kick it into the empty goal.\nThe Belgians did breath some life into their game, cutting the deficit with Casper Terho\'s fine shot in the 65th, but could not find another goal despite more pressure\nLeverkusen made sure they snapped their opponents\' nine-game unbeaten run when Adam Hlozek pounced on a weak Moris save to make it 4-1 in the 79th.\n\nIndia Cricket Score\xa0 | \xa0Indian Cricket News\xa0 | \xa0Indian News\xa0 | \xa0Bollywood Movies\xa0 | \xa0India Business News'}",Jeremie Frimpong,en

"{'content': 'Leverkusen\'s players celebrate after their team scored during the UEFA Europa League quarter-final ... [+] second-leg football match against Union Saint-Gilloise (Photo by LAURIE DIEFFEMBACQ/BELGA/AFP via Getty Images)\nBayer Leverkusen has reached the semifinal of a European competition by beating Belgian side Union Saint-Gilles 4-1 (5-2 on aggregate) on Thursday thanks to goals by Moussa Diaby (2’), Mitchel Bakker (37’), Jeremie Frimpong (60’) and Adam Hlozek (79’). Casper Terho (65’) scored the only goal for the hosts.\nIt marks the first time Leverkusen has reached the semifinal of a European competition since the club reached the Champions League final in the 2001/02 season. That year, Die Werkself was narrowly beaten 2-1 by Real Madrid thanks to a wonder strike by legendary French midfielder Zinedine Zidane. It was also the year that Leverkusen finished second in the league, second in the DFB Pokal, and then a large portion of the squad also finished second in the World Cup behind Brazil.\nThat season marked the origin of the term Vizekusen (Neverkusen). It is a term that current head coach Xabil Alonso wants to stamp out at the club. And a title for Leverkusen would do just that for a club that has won nothing since the 1992/93 season when the club beat Hertha Berlin’s reserve side to win the DFB Pokal.\nIn fairness, Leverkusen has had success in the Europa League, or rather its predecessor, the UEFA\nEFA\n Cup, winning the competition in 1988 by beating Spanish side Espanol. Now Leverkusen is just 180 minutes away from reaching the final of a European competition once again. While beating Roma will be difficult, there is a sense of optimism around the club that this is the year for Leverkusen to end the title drought.\nDirector of sports Simon Rolfes has stressed in the past that the Europa League would be an excellent pathway to end Leverkusen’s wait for a title. ""It is a big goal for us to win a title,"" Rolfes said in an interview conducted in November 2019. ""We have to have the ambitions to win the Europa League. It has to be our goal to play a key role in that competition.""\nNow four years later, the club has a realistic chance of winning an international trophy. In fact, winning the Europa League might be the most straightforward pathway to the Champions League, as Leverkusen is currently sixth, seven points behind fourth-placed RB Leipzig.\nBayer Leverkusen beat Espanol in 1988 to win the UEFA Cup (Photo by Bongarts/Getty Images)\n""We are focused on the semi-finals and are looking forward to preparing well,” Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso said after the game to UEFA.com. “The energy is good. Being in the semi-finals is great, but once you get there, you want more. We will do everything to win.""\nAlonso, of course, has been one of the major reasons for Leverkusen’s resurgence in the Bundesliga and the run of form in the Europa League. Since taking over the club in October, the Spaniard has overseen 29 games, won 16, drawn six, and only lost seven. Only Bayern, Dortmund, and Leipzig have collected more points in the Bundesliga since Alonso has taken over the club.\nThe Spaniard has been one of the major reasons for Leverkusen’s recent success. Another reason is Florian Wirtz. The teenage sensation has scored four goals and eight assists in 18 games since returning from his ACL injury. One of the most talented players on the planet, Wirtz has been crucial for his club’s success in recent weeks, and the 19-year-old is now fully focused on winning his first major trophy.\n""I\'d love to win the title,” Wirtz said to the German station RTL after the game. “It doesn\'t really bother me who we meet in the next round. We\'re going to see who it will be and will then prepare ourselves as well as possible for the next opponent."" Leverkusen does not want to sell Wirtz this summer, and winning the Europa League, which would come with an automatic spot in next season’s Champions League group stage, would go a long way to ensure that the forward will stay with the club.\nThat would be one significant advantage of winning the title. Another would be the added prestige a Europa League triumph would bring to the Bundesliga. Eintracht Frankfurt’s success last season was widely recognized around Europe, and for the league to grow, the Bundesliga will need other teams than Bayern to keep up the flag in Europe. Having back-to-back Europa League winners might not only keep a star in the league but also add significant prestige to the competition overall.\nManuel Veth is the host of the Bundesliga Gegenpressing Podcast and the Area Manager USA at Transfermarkt.

Real Madrid are already planning the long-term future and for this reason in the last few days they have decided internally to offer a new long-term deal to Eduardo Camavinga. The French midfielder is performing at excellent levels and the club is enthusiastic about him, starting with president Florentino Perez. His contract is still long and valid until June 2027, but Real Madrid want to increase his salary and change the release clause in his contract. Negotiations will take place soon.\nNow, let's get to the latest news and notes:\nLionel Messi, on the other hand, still has a few weeks under contract at Paris Saint-Germain and has not given a green light to the new contract offered by the club ast February after a verbal agreement was almost completed in December. It then collapsed following the disappointment of the Champions League League campaign. Messi still has no guarantees on PSG's 2023-2024 plan. Barcelona will insist on having him, Xavi Hernandez is calling him all the time but everything will depend on Financial Fair Play. Meanwhile, Al Hilal have made a monstrous official offer to convince Messi -- €400 million per season salary on the table, but Leo has only one priority which is to stay in Europe at least until Copa America 2024.\nIn the Premier League, Chelsea have appointed Frank Lampard as caretaker manager but discussions will continue with other candidates with Julian Nagelsmann and Luis Enrique as favorites to take the Blues job. Meanwhile, the club continues to plan for the future because the documents will soon be signed for Kendry Paéz, born in May 2007. Kendry is still 15 years old but plays with Ecuador under-17 team and with the first team of Independiente del Valle. Chelsea have a deal with the club and the player, signatures are coming soon and Kendry will move to England when he turns 18 in 2025. The cost of the deal could reach €20 million if all the add-ons included in the negotiation are reached in the future.\nFinally, keep an eye on Dutch full-back Jeremie Frimpong of Bayern Leverkusen. Manchester United have met his agent and his name is on the club's list for the summer, but Barcelona and Bayern Munich have also had a meeting with his representative. The race is on, the player dreams of the Premier League and Leverkusen want around a €25 million fee to let him leave.\n© 2004-2023 CBS Interactive.

"{'content': 'The January transfer window may be closed around Europe, but teams are looking ahead to the summer and there\'s plenty of gossip swirling around. Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!\nManchester United are looking at Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard and Celta Vigo midfielder Gabri Veiga, as has been reported by Football Insider.\nThe report states that the Red Devils are looking for a right-back and while Bayer Leverkusen\'s Jeremie Frimpong is the priority target to sign, Bayern Munich also hold an interest in the 22-year-old Frimpong. If the Man United are beaten to the signing of Frimpong, the Premier League club could instead throw all their efforts behind signing Pavard.\nWith Pavard\'s standing in the Bayern team likely to be under added threat upon Frimpong\'s arrival, that could create a suitable Plan B for Man United, with various outlets already reporting that the 27-year-old could leave the Allianz Arena.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Why Bayern Munich fired their coach\nAnother Football Insider report echoes ESPN\'s previous reporting that Manchester United are keeping tabs on Veiga ahead of a possible summer move, having already scouted the 20-year-old on several occasions.\nMan United manager Erik ten Hag is looking to strengthen in central midfield and Veiga has been enjoying a breakthrough campaign for Celta Vigo, recording nine goals and four assists in 26 LaLiga matches so far this term.\nEven so, a third report states that midfielder Marcel Sabitzer is keen to make his loan from Bayern Munich permanent with Man United looking to complete a deal. Bayern are expected to demand a transfer fee of between €25m-€30m for the 29-year-old, who has settled in well since moving to Old Trafford in the January window.\n22.00 BST: Aston Villa hold a strong interest in Manchester City midfielder Kalvin Phillips, according to Football Insider, who add that Unai Emery feels the 27-year-old would be a world class signing that could run their midfield. It is believed that City would demand £45m to recoup what they offered Leeds United in the summer, which would be a club record for Villa.\n21.30 BST: Fabrizio Romano has suggested that Chelsea want to keep Joao Felix for next season after signing the forward on loan from Atletico Madrid in January. While the Blues\' next manager could be a key factor in completing a permanent deal, the 23-year-old is happy at Stamford Bridge and would be keen to stay. Chelsea would need to negotiate with Atleti, who want around €100m.\n21.05 BST: Arsenal, Chelsea and Villarreal are all interested in a move for Wolfsburg right-back Ridle Baku, according to Sport Bild, although a deal is not expected to be cheap with his contract running until 2025 and including no release clause. RB Leipzig are also observing the 25-year-old.\n20.31 BST: Brighton & Hove Albion are keen to sign Arsenal winger Reiss Nelson as a free agent in the summer, reports The Daily Mail.\nThe Gunners are working on a new contract for the 23-year-old, whose current deal expires at the end of the season, but he has only made four Premier League appearances this season and could have a clearer route to minutes at the Amex. There is also interest from abroad, although Nelson would like to stay in the Premier League.\n20.01 BST: Mexican side Cruz Azul feel they can complete a move for Rayo Vallecano striker Radamel Falcao, according to Ekrem Konur. The 37-year-old has scored two goals in 21 LaLiga appearances this term, 18 of which have come from the bench.\n19.35 BST: Liverpool are set to rival West Ham United and Wolverhampton Wanderers in their attempts to sign Bristol City midfielder Alex Scott, reports The Daily Mail.\nThe Reds are said to have sent head of recruitment Dave Fallows and chief scout Barry Hunter to watch the 19-year-old help England U20 beat Germany in the recent international window.\n18.57 BST: Besiktas and Galatasaray are both taking a keen interest in the situation of Juventus striker Moise Kean, reports Calciomercato, with it still yet to be decided whether I Bianconeri will let him leave in the summer.\nThe 23-year-old\'s priority is proving that he should stay with the Serie A giants, as the Italy international feels he can be a good team player for them.\n18.09 BST: West Ham United have held a long-term interest in Manchester United\'s Aaron Wan-Bissaka and are ready to table an offer in the summer provided they stay in the Premier League, according to Football Insider.\n25-year-old Wan-Bissaka already faces competition from Diogo Dalot at Old Trafford, and the Red Devils have been heavily linked with a move for Bayer Leverkusen\'s Jeremie Frimpong, making the competition tight for the right-back spot under head coach Erik ten Hag.\n17.41 BST: Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring the situation of Nice midfielder Khephren Thuram, according to Ekrem Konur, who adds that they are possibly looking to make a move for the 22-year-old during the summer.\nThis comes shortly after Thuram made his France debut when he came of the bench as a late substitute in their 4-0 win against the Netherlands.\n16.41 BST: Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has come under fire.\nGab Marcotti and Don Hutchison discuss Virgil van Dijk\'s future after the defender was found wanting on multiple occasions vs. Arsenal.\n15.33 BST: Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City want to sign Inter Milan centre-back Alessandro Bastoni this summer, says Tuttosport.\nBastoni, 23, has yet to reach an agreement over a new contract at Inter and the Italy international is attracting attention from around Europe.\nInter and the player are far apart over wages, so PSG and City could see a chance to land him.\n14.18 BST: Watford forward Joao Pedro is on Newcastle\'s shortlist, says Football Insider.\nPedro, 21, saw a £30m offer rejected last summer but the Championship club could let him go as they are unlikely to seal promotion.\nThe Brazilian has nine goals and four assists in 31 Championship appearances this season.\n13.29 BST: Liverpool are looking to sign two players from Eintracht Frankfurt, says Bild.\nMidfielder Daicha Kamada and defender Evan Ndicka are both free agents at the end of the season, with the Reds keen to bring them in on free transfers.\nKamada, 26, has been linked with a move to Dortmund and Bayern Munich, while 23-year-old Ndicka has attracted interest from Arsenal.\n12.50 BST: Is Jesse Marsch coming back to management?\nJanusz Michallik reacts to reports linking Jesse Marsch with the vacant Leicester City job.\n12.17 BST: Chelsea left-back Ben Chilwell has reportedly agreed a new contract, according to The Athletic.\nChilwell, 26, joined from Leicester for £50m in 2020 and has a deal until 2025. However, with the England international linked with a move to Manchester City, Chelsea have moved to ensure he stays at Stamford Bridge until 2027.\n11.31 BST: Alejandro Balde is set to sign a new contract with Barcelona, extending his stay at the Catalan club until 2027, according to Diario Sport.\nBalde, 19, has been one of the revelations of the season at Camp Nou, making 34 appearances and knocking veteran left-back Jordi Alba out of the team.\nNegotiations have been ongoing with his agent, Jorge Mendes, for months over new terms, with reports suggesting an agreement is now close after the two parties ironed out the final details. However, getting Balde to commit his future to the club is just the first part of the dilemma for Barca as they also have to be able to register his new contract with LaLiga.\nGavi, Ronald Araujo and Marcos Alonso have also signed new deals in the last year but none have yet been registered with the Spanish league.\nBarca must reduce as much as €150m from their annual outgoings -- or raise money through transfers -- before LaLiga will inscribe the new deals.\n10.25 BST: English clubs are lining up to sign the Barcelona winger Abde Ezzalzouli, according to various reports in Spain.\nDiario Sport claims Wolverhampton Wanderers want to bring in the Morocco international this summer, while Mundo Deportivo adds that ""half the Premier League"" are tracking him.\nAbde, 21, scored twice at the weekend as Osasuna came from behind to beat Elche 2-1 in LaLiga to continue his impressive season on loan in Pamplona. He also scored a late winner against Sevilla last month and the only goal of the Copa del Rey semifinal first leg against Athletic Club as Osasuna progressed to the final, where they will meet Real Madrid in May.\nBarca are also monitoring the progress of Abde, who they signed from Hercules for €2m in 2021.\n""He is making the most of his loan, making differences for Osasuna,"" Barca coach Xavi said Sunday. ""They are really happy with him in Pamplona, he\'s professional, playing really well. At Barca, the level he was at on Saturday, you have to be at in every game. When he returns, we will look at it and decide what we do with him. He could be an important player in the future.""\nAbde made 12 first team appearances at Spotify Camp Nou last season, scoring one goal, but a loan was deemed the best option for his development this season following the signings of Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha.\n09.26 BST: Manchester United\'s desire to sign a central midfielder this summer is clear, with Brighton pair Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister on their shortlist, says The Daily Telegraph.\nCaicedo, 21, almost left the club in January amid £70m offers from Arsenal and Chelsea before falling out with the club over being forced to stay. However, he signed a new contract at the Amex Stadium until 2027.\nMeanwhile, Argentina World Cup winner Mac Allister signed a new deal in October and would likely cost in excess of £70m to sign as well.\nBarcelona\'s Frenkie de Jong and West Ham\'s Declan Rice have also been linked with United.\n08.53 BST: Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun is being tracked by AC Milan, says Calciomercato.\nBalogun, 21, is on loan at Reims this season and has 19 goals in 31 games for the club in all competitions.\nHowever, Arsenal have Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah up front so the England Under-21 international may not return to the Emirates. Instead, the Gunners could move him on for more than €30m.\n08.30 BST: Barcelona are preparing a ""revolution"" in the attacking positions this summer in an attempt to provide more support for Robert Lewandowski, according to Diario Sport.\nYannick Carrasco, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Vitor Roque and Abde Ezzalzouli could all be part of Xavi Hernandez\'s first-team squad next season with Ansu Fati, Ferran Torres and Raphinha\'s futures all said to be in doubt.\nLewandowski has netted 17 league goals, while Ansu, Ferran, Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele have managed just 18 between them. While a much-improved defence has meant that hasn\'t cost them in LaLiga, it has seen them come up short in the Champions League, the Europa League and the Copa del Rey.\nTherefore, Barca are planning to bring in new faces to freshen up their front line. Abde could return after an impressive season on loan at Osasuna and the club have already secured a €15m option to sign winger Carrasco from Atletico Madrid.\nThe Catalan side also want to add a striker to take the weight off Lewandowski. Brazilian teenager Roque is their top target, but if his price tag proves too high, they could bring Aubameyang back from Chelsea if he accepts a salary cut. That means, according to Sport, that Barca will listen to offers for Ansu, Ferran and Raphinha to help fund the changes up front.\nSteve Nicol gives his take on the title race after Arsenal dropped points in a 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Anfield.\n- Paris Saint-Germain want to sign 23-year-old Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby in the summer, according to Foot Mercato, who add that unnamed clubs from England and Italy are also interested. After coming through Les Parisiens\' academy, Diaby played a total of 34 games for the PSG first-team before moving to Germany in the summer of 2019.\n- Borussia Dortmund are keeping an eye on Burnley winger Anass Zaroury and sent scout Benjamin Frank to watch the 22-year-old, claims The Sun, who add that Olympique de Marseille, Monaco and Standard Liege have also watched him. Having seen the Morocco international help the Clarets reclaim their place in the Premier League, BVB could make Zaroury part of a recruitment drive if Jude Bellingham leaves in the summer.\n- Tottenham Hotspur have registered an interest in signing Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech, according to Football Insider, who add that Paris Saint-Germain could rekindle their interest in the 30-year-old. The Blues are said to be willing to accept offers in the region of £20m, with West Ham United and Fulham also looking at the Morocco international.\n- Internazionale like Tigre striker Mateo Retegui but will not commit to signing him until June, reports Calciomercato, with the probable valuation of around €20m for the 23-year-old potentially causing problems for the Champions League quarterfinalists. I Nerazzurri would need to qualify for Europe\'s primary competition again and complete certain transfers to make a deal happen, while Retegui -- who scored on his national team debut -- has made no secret of his desire to play in Italy.\n- Fabrizio Romano has suggested that Brentford goalkeeper David Raya will not sign a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2024. The Premier League outfit will aim to bring in €40m for the 27-year-old in the summer, with Raya\'s hope being that one of the big-name clubs monitoring the Spaniard will make a move when the transfer window opens.'}",Jeremie Frimpong,en

The report says Montpellier’s asking for around $35 million.The 6-foot center forward had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday’s visit from Toulouse. The advanced stats say he can carry the ball above average but basically has been strictly a finisher. Sounds like someone could use some schooling from a certain Harry Kane. (NM)March 23 – Spurs linked with Dean Henderson interestLook: A Tottenham story that isn’t about Antonio Conte or Harry Kane… at least entirely.That’s because ESPN says that Tottenham’s interest in Manchester United property/serial loanee Dean Henderson could be used to lower the cost for Kane.Henderson was 14 when he joined Manchester United from Carlisle United in 2011, and he made his senior move in 2015.Henderson’s on loan to Nottingham Forest, where it’s been no surprise that he shined before going down to injury. Henderson was twice Sheffield United Young Player of the Year, on loan, and won the Championship Golden Glove in boosting the Blades into the Premier League.Club legend Hugo Lloris has not been himself this season and is currently hurt, Fraser Forster is only under contract through 2023-24, and young keepers Brandon Austin and Alfie Whiteman have limited experience and all on loan. A solution will be needed, and soon. (NM)Feb. 19 – Spurs to pursue Antonio RudigerIs a London return on the cards for longtime Chelsea man Antonio Rudiger? Maybe, according to Spanish language site Fichajes.You’ll remember that the German center back wasn’t exactly angling to leave the Blues but uncertainty over the club’s ownership following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Roman Abramovich’s links to his country’s president Vladimir Putin led to Rudiger moving to Real Madrid.The 29-year-old has been a regular starter at the Bernabeu but the report says continued Real links with new backs including RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol may unsettle Rudiger, who just wants regular playing time and a stable situation.

Right back Matt Doherty is now expected to join Atletico Madrid after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with Tottenham. (AE)Jan. 31 – Pedro Porro loan move nears, Doherty to Atletico Madrid, Gil moves on loanMatt Doherty may be leaving Tottenham on loan to Atletico Madrid, according to reports, while fullback Djed Spence will also be leaving on loan.Atleti has plenty of success with their last acquisition of a fullback from Spurs, as Kieran Trippier shined at the Wanda Metropolitano.And Spence reportedly turned down a loan to Atleti in favor of a move to Rennes in Ligue 1, while Bryan Gil is going on loan to Sevilla.All this as Tottenham hopes to land Pedro Porro from Sporting Lisbon in a move that’s been slow-cooking all month and had plenty of complications. The Spence and Doherty reports will give Spurs fans hope that the Porro deal is coming.Spurs also signed 19-year-old Chelsea starlet Jude Soonsup-Bell on a long-term deal (NM)Jan. 25 – Spurs confirm Danjuma dealWill the second time be the charm for Arnaut Danjuma when it comes to the Premier League?Danjuma joins Spurs on loan for the rest of the season. He’s been playing plenty of center forward and can give Harry Kane a rest, but will also be plenty happy to head to the left wing.The Bournemouth winger scored 10 times last season in La Liga and struck six times in 11 UEFA Champions League games, including in knockout round games against Juventus and Bayern Munich.The 25-year-old has six goals in 17 matches across all competitions this season for Villarreal. (NM)Jan. 24 – Danjuma to make late u-turn and join Spurs?Arnaut Danjuma appeared to be heading to Everton from Villarreal but the Dutch winger could now be making a very late u-turn. Danjuma, 25, has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs and looked set to join the Toffees on loan. Despite Frank Lampard being sacked, Danjuma was still expected to sign for Everton but our colleagues in the UK at Sky Sports say he is now heading to Tottenham for talks and a medical has been scheduled for him on Tuesday evening. Danjuma would be a solid squad player for Tottenham and we’ve seen flashes of his brilliance for Bournemouth and also at Villarreal. Antonio Conte wanted to sign some extra cover in attacking areas and it looks like he will get it. (JPW)\n#Tottenham have scheduled a medical for Arnaut Danjuma for this evening.

The 29-year-old striker has been heavily linked with a move to both Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Manchester United in the past but a move to the former now seems like it has passed after Erling Haaland’s arrival. Per a report from David Ornstein, Kane and Spurs will talk in early February about a new deal and his priority is to ‘succeed with Tottenham.’ This is all quite a change from the previous years when it has seemed like Kane was very close to leaving but couldn’t force through an exit as Spurs asked for a huge transfer fee (and rightly so) for their star man. Despite Spurs struggling at the moment as they lose ground in the top four race and the future of Antonio Conte as boss is uncertain, having Kane sign a new contract would at least give Spurs fans some good news as they’ll know Kane will be around to score 20-25 goals a season for at least the next few years. (JPW)\n🚨 EXCL: Harry Kane open to signing new contract at Tottenham. No dialogue since summer 2021 but talks planned for after Jan window.

Playing with a focal point like Harry Kane could take him to the next level. (NM)Jan. 9 – Trossard, Raya linked with SpursTottenham have been linked with moves for both Leandro Trossard and David Raya as they try to strengthen their lineup. According to The Telegraph, Brentford and Spain goalkeeper Raya, 27, is seen as the long-term replacement for Hugo Lloris. The French captain only recently signed a contract extension but Lloris, 36, has been linked with a move away from Tottenham in recent years. Per the report, Raya will become Spurs’ top goalkeeping target in the summer and he is a fine shot-stopper and is very good playing the ball out of the back with his feet.As for Trossard, this seems like a deal which could happen in January. The Daily Mail claim that Spurs are among several clubs, including Chelsea, who are set to move for the Belgian winger. Trossard, 28, is out of contract at Brighton next summer and didn’t feature in their win at Everton or in their 5-1 FA Cup win at Middlesbrough. It seems like a move this month could be possible as Brighton will aim to recoup some cash for their talented winger/wing-back. Trossard has added goals and assists to his game over the last 12 months and was a key cog in Graham Potter’s success as a hybrid wing-back. However, Roberto De Zerbi could use Kaoru Mitoma in that role and Brighton will look to move on Trossard in January. Spurs need to upgrade their wing-back potions and if Trossard comes in on the left, it would allow Ivan Perisic to play further up the pitch. Alternatively, Trossard is also comfortable playing as a winger or attacking midfielder and he is proven in the Premier League. Is he the type of player who can turn Spurs into a guaranteed top four team? Probably not. Is he a top quality addition who has the potential to slot in seamlessly? He is. (JPW)Dec. 29 – Tottenham, Manchester United open talks with Rennes for Martin TerrierYes, Tottenham’s just splashed plenty of cash on a star left winger in Richarlison, but would the versatility of Martin Terrier make him a great fit to compete with the Brazilian as well as Heung-min Son?Free-scoring Rennes forward Terrier is said to be a target for Tottenham and Manchester United\xa0as both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the Ligue 1 outfit regarding the 25-year-old. Price tag? It reportedly starts around $38 million.Terrier has scored and assisted on the regular in France’s top flight. He scored 21 goals last season and has eight in 14 matches this season. The left wing can also play center forward amongst other positions. He’s chipped in three goals in the Europa League this campaign and also had provided 11 assists across all competitions since the start of last season.Very strong in the air and plenty good in combination play, Terrier has posted impressed xG and xA numbers and could combine with Kane but also deputize for the exhaustively-used CF. He may be a better fit for Spurs but might Man United before more willing to spend to get him?

Per the report, Spurs are willing to pay up to $41 million for the Texas native. McKennie, 23, was signed for Juventus by their former sporting director Fabio Paratici, who is now in the same role at Spurs. Antonio Conte wants to strengthen his midfield options and McKennie would be a near-perfect fit in midfield in Conte’s aggressive, mobile 4-3-3 system. His versatility is also stated as a big factor for Conte.But there’s a twist. There’s always a twist. With superstar Paul Pogba arriving back at Juventus this summer and expected to eat up plenty of the minutes McKennie was previously getting, Pogba has just gone down with a knee injury in preseason. That requires surgery and it means Juve may not move on McKennie this summer after all. Another twist? McKennie is yet to feature on Juventus’ preseason tour of the United States of America as he was unused substitute in each of their games against Barcelona and Chivas Guadalajara. During the tour Juve boss Max Allegri has stated that McKennie is working his way back to full fitness, so maybe there’s nothing to read into here, but it is a little odd that Juventus haven’t given any minutes to one of the best USMNT players on their U.S. tour, right? Perhaps they aren’t risking him being injured as a transfer away is imminent? McKennie seems fairly happy at Juventus but it seems inevitable he will end up in the Premier League at some point. (JPW)July 19 – Tottenham finally sign Djed SpenceTottenham have finally confirmed the signing of Djed Spence, 21, from Middlesbrough as the talented right back/wing-back becomes Antonio Conte’s sixth signing of the summer window. Spence excelled while he was on loan at Nottingham Forest last season and it is believed he’s signed for Spurs for an initial $15 million fee and add ons could take the deal to $24 million. Spence is regarded as one of the top young right back prospects in England and he will push Emerson Royal and Matt Doherty all the way for a starting spot. Spence is exactly the kind of right wing-back Conte loves in his 3-4-3 system and his attacking instincts will slot in really well at Spurs.

The 27-year-old is said to have stayed Thursday night in Tottenham’s on-site hotel at the club’s training facility.While Ben Davies was certainly a (surprising) standout performer as the left-sided center back in Conte’s back-three down the stretch last season, Lenglet represents an upgrade in quality and his arrival instantly creates depth at a vitally important (and dangerous thin) position in Tottenham’s squad. As is the case all over the field, there will be plenty of games to go around — in two condensed half-seasons either side of the World Cup, with the five-substitutes rule once again in effect as well.

Bissouma, a Mali international, had one year left on his contract at Brighton and that drove his transfer fee down.

Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici are certainly delivering the additions Conte wanted. This is a very savvy addition by Spurs. With Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur the first-choice pairing in central midfield and Oliver Skipp around too, Conte now has four top quality options for his two central midfield spots.

The report says Montpellier’s asking for around $35 million.\nThe 6-foot center forward had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday’s visit from Toulouse. The advanced stats say he can carry the ball above average but basically has been strictly a finisher. Sounds like someone could use some schooling from a certain Harry Kane. (NM)\nLook: A Tottenham story that isn’t about Antonio Conte or Harry Kane… at least entirely.\nThat’s because ESPN says that Tottenham’s interest in Manchester United property/serial loanee Dean Henderson could be used to lower the cost for Kane.\nHenderson was 14 when he joined Manchester United from Carlisle United in 2011, and he made his senior move in 2015.\nHenderson’s on loan to Nottingham Forest, where it’s been no surprise that he shined before going down to injury. Henderson was twice Sheffield United Young Player of the Year, on loan, and won the Championship Golden Glove in boosting the Blades into the Premier League.\nClub legend Hugo Lloris has not been himself this season and is currently hurt, Fraser Forster is only under contract through 2023-24, and young keepers Brandon Austin and Alfie Whiteman have limited experience and all on loan. A solution will be needed, and soon. (NM)\nIs a London return on the cards for longtime Chelsea man Antonio Rudiger? Maybe, according to Spanish language site Fichajes.\nYou’ll remember that the German center back wasn’t exactly angling to leave the Blues but uncertainty over the club’s ownership following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Roman Abramovich’s links to his country’s president Vladimir Putin led to Rudiger moving to Real Madrid.\nThe 29-year-old has been a regular starter at the Bernabeu but the report says continued Real links with new backs including RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol may unsettle Rudiger, who just wants regular playing time and a stable situation. (NM)\nIns\nArnaut Danjuma – Villarreal (loan)\nJude Soonsup-Bell – Chelsea\nOuts\nMatt Doherty (contract termination)\nAs one full back is set to arrive in north London, another has left. Right back Matt Doherty is now expected to join Atletico Madrid after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with Tottenham. (AE)\nMatt Doherty may be leaving Tottenham on loan to Atletico Madrid, according to reports, while fullback Djed Spence will also be leaving on loan.\nAtleti has plenty of success with their last acquisition of a fullback from Spurs, as Kieran Trippier shined at the Wanda Metropolitano.\nAnd Spence reportedly turned down a loan to Atleti in favor of a move to Rennes in Ligue 1, while Bryan Gil is going on loan to Sevilla.\nAll this as Tottenham hopes to land Pedro Porro from Sporting Lisbon in a move that’s been slow-cooking all month and had plenty of complications. The Spence and Doherty reports will give Spurs fans hope that the Porro deal is coming.\nSpurs also signed 19-year-old Chelsea starlet Jude Soonsup-Bell on a long-term deal (NM)\nWill the second time be the charm for Arnaut Danjuma when it comes to the Premier League?\nDanjuma joins Spurs on loan for the rest of the season. He’s been playing plenty of center forward and can give Harry Kane a rest, but will also be plenty happy to head to the left wing.\nThe Bournemouth winger scored 10 times last season in La Liga and struck six times in 11 UEFA Champions League games, including in knockout round games against Juventus and Bayern Munich.\nThe 25-year-old has six goals in 17 matches across all competitions this season for Villarreal. (NM)\nArnaut Danjuma appeared to be heading to Everton from Villarreal but the Dutch winger could now be making a very late u-turn. Danjuma, 25, has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs and looked set to join the Toffees on loan. Despite Frank Lampard being sacked, Danjuma was still expected to sign for Everton but our colleagues in the UK at Sky Sports say he is now heading to Tottenham for talks and a medical has been scheduled for him on Tuesday evening. Danjuma would be a solid squad player for Tottenham and we’ve seen flashes of his brilliance for Bournemouth and also at Villarreal. Antonio Conte wanted to sign some extra cover in attacking areas and it looks like he will get it. (JPW)\n#Tottenham have scheduled a medical for Arnaut Danjuma for this evening.

The 29-year-old striker has been heavily linked with a move to both Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Manchester United in the past but a move to the former now seems like it has passed after Erling Haaland’s arrival. Per a report from David Ornstein, Kane and Spurs will talk in early February about a new deal and his priority is to ‘succeed with Tottenham.’ This is all quite a change from the previous years when it has seemed like Kane was very close to leaving but couldn’t force through an exit as Spurs asked for a huge transfer fee (and rightly so) for their star man. Despite Spurs struggling at the moment as they lose ground in the top four race and the future of Antonio Conte as boss is uncertain, having Kane sign a new contract would at least give Spurs fans some good news as they’ll know Kane will be around to score 20-25 goals a season for at least the next few years.

(NM)\nApril 9 – Man Utd become front-runner for long-time Ten Hag target Frimpong\nNetherlands youth international Jeremie Frimpong could hop back to Manchester for a different color jersey than his youth days.\nFrimpong, 22, came up through the ranks at Manchester City and exploded onto the scene with a move to Celtic in 2019.\nThe youngster impressed in 1.5 seasons in Glasgow, winning a Premiership, Scottish Cup, and League Cup treble before moving to Bayer Leverkusen midway through the 2020-21 season.\nHe’s on fire this season, with eight goals and six assists from the wide places. His ball progression numbers are outlandish in nearly 2.5 seasons with the Bundesliga outfit, and Ten Hag is said to have wanted to bring him to Old Trafford last summer, too. (NM)\n\nMarch 28 – Goncalo Ramos emerges as top target for summer\nBenfica and Portugal forward Goncalo Ramos has emerged as a top target for Manchester United this summer. According to a report from Record in Portugal, United want to sign Ramos as they need a new man to lead their attack. Per the report, Ramos has a release clause of $130 million in his contract. Given that Manchester United would have to pay a similar fee for Harry Kane and a deal for Kane would prove very difficult given Spurs’ reluctance to sell to a Premier League rivals, perhaps a move for Ramos, 21, is more attainable?\nIt would slot in with their philosophy of buying young emerging talents such as Jadon Sancho and Antony in recent windows and Ramos’ style of play would suit Erik ten Hag and United well. With injury issues to Anthony Martial throughout this season and Wout Weghorst expected to return to Burnley when his loan ends this summer, only Marcus Rashford is around to lead the charge up top. Even he is better starting out on the left so signing a new striker is a priority for ETH this summer and Ramos is experienced enough at a very young age, but also on the way up with plenty of room for improvement, to suggest he would be the perfect long-term option. (JPW)\n\nMarch 27 – Manu Kone price tag starts at $53M plus add-ons\nKouadio “Manu” Kone is being linked with a move to Manchester United as the Red Devils look to invigorate their midfield with a player who won’t turn 22 until May.\nKone debuted for Toulouse as a teenager and came into his own once the club was relegated to Ligue 2 for the 2020-21 season.\nHis performances there got him a move to Borussia Dortmund, where the central midfielder has become a regular contributor as an aggressive dribbler and tackler.\nFabrizio Romano says Man United will face competition from Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea when it comes to the France U-21 star’s signature. (NM)\nMarch 23 – Red Devils to beat Chelsea to Watford teenage starlet\nWatford left back Harry Amass is on the fast track to Hornets success, but instead may choose life in Manchester United’s academy over first team time at age 16 (?!).\nAmass is an England U-15 and U-16 call-up who has made the bench for Watford against Reading in a January FA Cup match.\nThe London Evening Standard says that Amass believed a Champions League regular would be a better spot for his growth, and that Manchester United is expected to win his signature over Chelsea. (NM)\n\nMarch 15 – Manchester United linked with $145 million bid for Eintracht forward\nRegarding our latest update, Manchester United being linked with nine-figure strikers may become rather common until it solves its center forward challenges.\nBild, via Sky Sports, says that United will offer around $145 million for Eintracht Frankfurt’s Randal Kolo Muani, The 24-year-old forward scored his first senior goal for France when he added\xa0Les Bleus’\xa0second goal of a 2-0 win over Morocco. He has five caps.\nKolo Muani’s star has risen dramatically over the past three seasons. He joined Nantes at age 17 and took a\xa0Championnat National loan before scoring nine Ligue 1 goals and eight assists two seasons again and bagging 12 goals in his second season.\nKolo Muani then signed for Eintracht Frankfurt and his first season in Germany has been exceptional. He has 16 goals and 14 assists across all competitions and Eintracht made it to the Champions League Round of 16 (where it seems destined to dip out following Wednesday’s second leg at Napoli, where it’s down 2-0).\nFBRef.com details Kolo Muani as an elite ball carrier for a center forward, but the price tag is absolutely massive. That said, perhaps $100M is the new $50M. Rich. (NM)\n\nMarch 11 – Harry Kane is Erik ten Hag’s No. 1 summer target\nImagine a Manchester United attacking three of Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, and Antony, sitting\xa0underneath Harry Kane.\nCome on, right? That’ll give any back line a run for its money, and the\xa0Manchester Evening Newssays that Erik ten Hag has prioritized Kane for a summer move.\nKane, 29, is heading into the final year of his Tottenham contract, with Spurs looking a good bet to keep their place in the top four and give Kane a route back into the Champions League.\nBut Kane has also been heavily linked with a move to Bayern Munich if he were to leave Tottenham, leaving North London without drawing as much domestic ire from a club and fan base which has earned him so much devotion.\nThe same report says Anthony Martial is going to leave United this summer.\nCould you see Kane at Old Trafford in a home shirt? The powerhouse forward has been as crucial a finisher as any player in the Premier League not named Erling Haaland. Kane has 22 goal involvements in 27 Premier League games, not far off Haaland’s — relatively speaking — 32 in 25.\xa0 (NM)\n\nFebruary 27 — Red Devils linked with Celta Vigo starlet\nManchester United’s been linked with several players this weekend including long-time target Lautaro Martinez, but the biggest heat might be under the fight for Celta Vigo’s Gabri Veiga.\nArsenal, Atletico Madrid, and Man Utd are reportedly in hot pursuit of the 20-year-old, viewing as a ball-carrying wizard with a eye for goal.\nVeiga has eight goals, three assists, and 46 shot-creating actions during 22 La Liga matches for Celta, where he plays as an attacking midfielder and has earned call-ups to Spain’s U-18 and U-21 sides.

He’s been in a more defensive role at Bayern.A hard-tackling midfielder who likes to both advance the ball and receive the ball in advanced spots, Sabitzer could be another masterstroke from Erik ten Hag. (NM)\nMarcel Sabitzer wants to leave and Manchester United are now pushing in talks with Bayern. Discussions on the formula of the deal, ongoing. 🚨🔴 #MUFC #DeadlineDay\nChelsea are currently busy with other deals and not with Sabitzer as things stand. pic.twitter.com/biAyw4XkXW\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 31, 2023\nJanuary 16 – Denzel Dumfries in discussions with Red Devils\nDenzel Dumfries had a brilliant World Cup — USMNT fans may still be haunted by his name — and now may be headed for the Premier League.\nTutto Mercato says that Inter Milan is entertaining talks with Manchester United about uniting the Dutch right wingback with his countryman Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.\nThe reported price tag? $40-42 million.\nOne reason to consider this a bit unusual is that Diogo Dalot has become a Ten Hag favorite and currently occupies the right flank with Aaron Wan-Bissaka as the backup. Of course Ten Hag wants depth but Dumfries isn’t leaving Inter Milan to be a backup.\nhttps://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/serie-a/tmw-inter-dumfries-puo-partire-con-un-offerta-da-40-milioni-sondaggi-di-chelsea-e-united-1779776\n\nJanuary 12 – Weghorst to United officially official\nIt is done. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Wout Weghorst terminated his loan deal with Besiktas, completed his medical and officially joined Manchester United on loan. It was widely reported that United have paid $3.2 million in compensation to Besiktas to sign Weghorst on loan from Burnley until the summer. Erik ten Hag wanted an extra forward option and the 30-year-old Dutch striker is his man. Weghorst will give United something totally different and his hold-up play should suit their style of play extremely well. (JPW/AE)\n\nJanuary 10 – Reports say Weghorst ready to personally pay compensation to leave Besiktas\nOkay, this is pretty wild, but reports from Turkish journalist Gokhan Dinc state that Wout Weghorst is ready to pay compensation to Besiktas so he can rip up his loan deal with them and head to Manchester United. That’s right, the 30-year-old Dutch forward will dip into his own pocket to pay the termination fee to the Turkish giants who have an agreement with Burnley to loan him for this season. With Manchester United coming in for Weghorst and wanting to loan him until the summer, the forward is said to be desperate to join the Red Devils and even waved goodbye to Besiktas fans after scoring his most recent goal for them. This is fast moving but Weghorst was pictured training with Besiktas in photos released on Tuesday, so it appears there is still a little way to go in this one. (JPW)\n\nJanuary 9 – Besiktas holding firm over Weghorst deal; monster deals lined up summer\nTurkish giants Besiktas have released a statement saying there will be no imminent move from Burnley to Manchester United for their on-loan striker Wout Weghorst. They added that reports suggesting it is possible to get Weghorst out of his loan deal to them for $3 million are wide of the mark. The Dutch forward is subject of serious interest from United as a loan signing until the end of the season as Erik ten Hag looks to boost his attacking options.\nWeghorst is currently on loan at Besiktas from Burnley but the Turkish Super Lig side want to be compensated if Burnley decides to recall him and then he heads to United. The Dutch international, 30, has scored eight goals in 16 league games for Besiktas this season and they are extremely reluctant to let him go. Weghorst will give United an aerial threat up top, plus he can hold up the ball, link play and Erik ten Hag knows him extremely well. Per a report from ESPN, Weghorst is the short-term solution and in the summer United will try to sign Harry Kane, Benjamin Sesko or Victor Osimhen. That trio are the long-term options for United to build their attack around but in the meantime they certainly need to add one forward who is something different to what they already have and can help them in the League Cup, FA Cup, Europa League and Premier League grind. (JPW)\nJanuary 7 – Man United negotiating loan move for Wout WeghorstEarlier this week, Erik ten Hag made Manchester United’s January intentions very clear: “We are looking for a striker,” he said. According to multiple reports, the Red Devils are in talks with Burnley over Dutch forward Wout Weghorst, who is currently on loan to Besiktas. To facilitate a move to Old Trafford — temporary or otherwise — Burnley would have to recall Weghorst from his loan spell in Turkey. (AE)\n\nJan. 4 – Jack Butland in talks over becoming United’s No. 2 goalkeeper\nAccording to The Telegraph Jack Butland, still just 29 years old, is in talks about signing for Manchester United. Butland is currently the back-up goalkeeper at Crystal Palace but with Martin Dubravka recalled by Newcastle United from his loan at Manchester United, the Red Devils need an extra goalkeeper to step in for David de Gea when needed. They currently have Tom Heaton as their other goalkeeping option.\nButland is an England international who suffered a serious ankle injury just when he was pushing to become England’s No. 1 but he still made the 2018 World Cup squad. He was relegated with Stoke City just before the World Cup and battled it out with them in the Championship before moving to Crystal Palace in 2020 to try and revive his career. He has six months left on his contract at Palace and remains behind Vicente Guaita in the pecking order so swapping a back-up role at Palace for a back-up role at United is a pretty decent move. Butland will likely play in FA Cup, League Cup and perhaps some Europa League games for United and with David de Gea’s future not certain, perhaps a spot could open up for him to fully revive his career? (JPW)\n\nJan. 2 – Ten Hag: “We are looking for a striker”\nWith a top-four place very much within reach, Erik ten Hag has confirmed Manchester United’s top January priority: a striker.\n“We are looking for offensive players. We are looking for a striker. We are always in the market but it has to match the sporting criteria — also the financial criteria. We do what we can to bring in the players we need.”\n\nDec. 29 – Manchester United, Tottenham open talks with Rennes for Martin Terrier\nDiscussions about a new center forward at Manchester United had become commonplace even before it cut ties with Cristiano Ronaldo but another left winger (who, yes, also plays some center forward)?\nFree-scoring Rennes forward Martin Terrier is said to be a target for United as well as Tottenham Hotspur as both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the Ligue 1 outfit regarding the 25-year-old. Price tag? It reportedly starts around $38 million.\nTerrier has become a regular amongst the Ligue 1 scoring charts, bagging 21 goals last season and already delivering eight in 14 matches this season. He’s chipped in three goals in Europa League and also had provided 11 assists across all competitions since the start of last season.\nVery strong in the air and a good passer to boot, Terrier is an expected goals and assists monster who could combine with Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, and Anthony Martial (plus others) to haunt Premier League defenses. Problem is, might he match up just as well with Harry Kane and Tottenham? Antonio Conte is said to be on the case. (NM)\n\nDec. 21 – Cody Gakpo to continue Eredivisie imports at Old Trafford\nUPDATE: Gakpo has signed for Liverpool\nPSV Eindhoven held onto young Cody Gakpo this summer and the Dutch club looks fit to reap the rewards as it holds out for a club record transfer fee.\nThat wouldn’t be a problem for Man United if it goes for Gakpo, who has been rated at $50 million-plus and that fee has not been a problem in the past. According to talkSPORT, United are ‘desperate’ to sign Gakpo in January.\nThere are some Robin van Persie qualities in the 23-year-old’s game, but Gakpo will be hoping to find RVP’s highs and reproduce them more often in his career.\nGakpo stands 6-foot-2 and often comes off the left wing, scoring three goals in five appearances at the 2022 World Cup.\nThe Netherlands star has an almost-absurd nine goals and 12 assists in 14 Eredivisie minutes this young season, chipping in three more goals and two assists in the Europa League.\nHe’d join Lisandro Martinez, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia as imports from the Netherlands’ top flight. (NM)\n\nDec. 21 – Diogo Costa to join World Cup teammate Bruno Fernandes in Old Trafford move?\nNote the vowel: This is not about Diego Costa, now at Wolves.\nNo, it’s DIogo Costa, who was Portugal’s goalkeeper at the recently-completed World Cup in Qatar and apparently got tongues wagging around Old Trafford.\nBut the Red Devils would have to wait until summer, according to a report translated by Sky Sports, and they will have to pay Porto big bucks.\nAccording to Portuguese outlet\xa0Correio da Manha, Costa will not be allowed to leave Porto in January and any move in the summer would require United to pay the full €75m (£65m) to release him.\nThe Swiss-born 23-year-old has 11 caps for Portugal and allowed just six goals in five matches in Qatar. Costa has appeared for Portugal at the U15-U21 levels and also performed for the Olympic team.\n\nLatest transfer news\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Liverpool transfer news, live!

However, no deals have been lined up for him and Erik ten Hag and United have always stated that they want Ronaldo to stay. It seems like they may win this battle as the only real options left are Sporting Lisbon and Napoli on loan, and even those two deals seem very tough to get done with just over 24 hours to go in the summer window.“It’s clear, of course. We need quality players,” Erik ten Hag said when asked about Ronaldo staying at United.\xa0“You need more to cover all the games to keep the consistency going, that’s what we strive for.”If he doesn’t leave, let’s see how Ronaldo reacts to being a bit-part played at United over the next few months… (JPW)August 29 – Antony flying to Manchester for medical ahead of $100 million moveBrazilian winger Antony, 22, will be on his way to Manchester shortly for his medical, according to Fabrizio Romano. After United and Ajax finally agreed a fee of $100 million (after a little push from Antony as he expressed his desire to leave the Amsterdam club), Antony is now ready to head to Manchester to complete the formalities of this huge deal. Do United need a winger? Probably not. But Antony’s arrival would add another attacking player who is able to play across the front line and United’s forward unit would become even more flexible. (JPW)\nManchester United are planning for Antony's arrival and medical tests, while contracts have been approved by clubs and player side.

Casemiro recently held talks with the Real Madrid hierarchy and indicated that he “wants a new challenge” at this point in his career. According to reports, Casemiro’s contract will pay him just short of $450,000 per week ($23.4 million annually), marking significant investment in a vitally important position as Erik ten Hag tries to right a wayward ship. The transfer fee is reportedly $70.9 million with another $11.8 million possible in add-ons.

The only problem, at least thus far, is that Dest doesn’t necessarily want to leave Catalonia. Now, according to a report from the Independent‘s Miguel Delaney, Manchester United and new manager Erik ten Hag are “making progress” on a deal to bring Dest to Old Trafford. Dest played two seasons under Ten Hag at Ajax, from 2019-2021. (AE)\nAm told United are making progress on Dest, toohttps://t.co/Yt69LKlvQW\n— Miguel Delaney (@MiguelDelaney) August 19, 2022August 18 – Pulisic loan deal in doubtThe reports that Christian Pulisic is a loan target for Manchester United are swirling but both the BBC and Sky Sports believe a loan move for the USMNT star to United is very unlikely. Why? Well, Chelsea don’t want to strengthen a potential top four rival by letting the 23-year-old join them. Per the latest reports, Chelsea would prefer to sell Pulisic on a permanent deal or they may want him to extend his contract with them first before loaning him so his market value remains high. It seems unlikely that United, or any other club, will pay what Chelsea want for Pulisic as the American winger has just under two years left on his contract and the Blues are said to want to recoup most of the $70 million they paid for him in 2019. (JPW)August 18 – Casemiro now the main target for UnitedAccording to a report from The Athletic’s David Ornstein, Manchester United’s main transfer target is now Casemiro from Real Madrid. The 30-year-old Brazilian midfielder has been a star at Real over the last nine years, winning five UEFA Champions League titles and his status as a Real legend is undoubted as he’s meshed so well with Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. Per the report, United have offered Casemiro huge wages and see him as being key to Erik ten Hag’s rebuild as he would give the team defensive stability in midfield. The midfielder is also said to be keen on a move (he’s been offered a five-year contract which will reportedly almost double his wages) and he has just under three years left on his current contract at Real Madrid. It is believed Casemiro would cost in the region of $70 million.Would Casemiro be a good fit? Of course he would. He would break up play, get attacks going and general dominate the engine room. However, he is just one of a few key players United need to sign between now and the end of the summer window. Erik ten Hag needs a deep-lying playmaker (ahem, Frenkie de Jong…) to sit alongside Casemiro as that means all of the tackles he wins will then be used effectively to start attacks. Perhaps Christian Eriksen alongside Casemiro would work? (JPW)August 17 – Cristiano Ronaldo sends cryptic message ahead of expected exitCristiano Ronaldo is apparently keeping a notebook with all of his transfer rumors, as the egomaniac Portuguese megastar is reportedly moving closer to get his desired Manchester United exit, with the club reportedly now ready to sell him.Ronaldo says that the media has been “telling lies” about him and his potential moves while promising that he will give an interview in two weeks’ time to give all the details of his summer. Does this mean he’s planning to stay, or just that he knows any Ronaldo transfer is going to take to the end of the transfer window?Our own Joe-Prince Wright has more on the story, here.We couldn’t wait two weeks, so we went in a time machine and found it: “I will always love Manchester United and am sad to leave/excited to stay. Something about Sir Alex. GGMU.” (NM)August 17 – Christian Pulisic open to Man United loan moveManchester United has reportedly joined the list of clubs interested in taking USMNT winger Christian Pulisic on loan from Chelsea, and the player is said to be into the move.Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Newcastle United, and AC Milan have also been linked with Pulisic, who wants to stay at Chelsea but is anxious to leave Stamford Bridge in pursuit of playing time before the World Cup.United could pair Pulisic and Jadon Sancho on either side of a center forward, whether Anthony Martial, Cristiano Ronaldo, or even Marcus Rashford. A new face has been expected to join United at CF for some time, too.What does it say about the status of Manchester United that Chelsea would be open to the move? And to a lesser extent, what does it say about Thomas Tuchel’s view of Pulisic? (NM)August 14 – USMNT back Sergino Dest linked with Old TraffordBarcelona boss Xavi Hernandez needs players to leave in order to give him the freedom to register new players before the end of the window but Sergino Dest has so far shown desire to fight for his place.And so Dest’s omission from the 18 for Barcelona’s 0-0 draw with Rayo Vallecano on Saturday is reportedly intended to show the USMNT back his status in the pecking order, and now Man United is said to feel encouraged at their chances of wooing the player to Old Trafford.Dest will surely want to play and Saturday could well serve as the intended wake-up call. Gregg Berhalter will be encouraging Dest to go somewhere he can play and United would provide that hope with reports of Diogo Dalot going the other way. With a pal in Frenkie de Jong continually linked with United, maybe having a teammate join them in the move could sway both to Manchester?Would it be good for Dest? Who knows? United is a mess right now but the player would be familiar with so many pieces at United including fellow ex-Ajax men Lisandro Martinez and Erik ten Hag.

Ronaldo made the announcement himself on Friday, via Instagram, commented “Domingo o rei joga” — “Sunday, the king plays.” It was reported earlier on Friday that the Portuguese superstar had been left out of Erik ten Hag’s squad for a friendly against Atletico Madrid on Saturday (in Oslo, Norway), but Ronaldo has indicated his return is slated for a friendly against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday (at Old Trafford). (AE)July 29 – Ronaldo’s agent in talks with former club Sporting LisbonWe now that Cristiano Ronaldo wants out of Manchester United and his first-ever club, Sporting Lisbon, could be the solution. According to a report from The Athletic, Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, is in talks with the Sporting hierarchy over a potential deal. Ronaldo, 37, came up through the youth team at Sporting and left them for Manchester United when he was 18. Sporting finished second in the Portuguese top-flight last season, so are in the Champions League group stage and Ronaldo is adamant he wants to move to a club playing in the Champions League. So, in theory, this seems like a good fit. But financially there’s no way Sporting Lisbon could afford this move and Ronaldo will have to lower his wage demands massively.With Atletico Madrid, Napoli, Bayern Munich and Chelsea all passing up on signing Ronaldo, the legendary forward has basically run out of other options to leave Manchester United this summer. There has been talk that United want Ronaldo to sign his option of an extra year on his contract (which will take him up to the summer of 2024) and he will then be loaned out to Sporting Lisbon for the 2022-23 season. That scenario still seems very unlikely but what other choice does Ronaldo have right now? He’s used to getting his own way when it comes to negotiations because, well, he’s Ronaldo. But Ronaldo and his representatives have badly miscalculated this one and Manchester United are holding firm as Erik ten Hag wants him in his plans for the 2022-23 campaign. (JPW)July 28 – Cristiano Ronaldo still wants out after talksManchester United could not sell Cristiano Ronaldo on its project after crisis talks with the reportedly wantaway star, according to Sky Sports.Ronaldo, 37, still wants to leave Old Trafford after flying into Manchester to meet with club hierarchy, but is now training with the team.The reporting says Ronaldo wants to exit in order to join a UEFA Champions League club, and to be fair this is totally on-brand and what United should’ve expected when signing the Portuguese.But that’s not changing United’s stance on Ronaldo, as they do not want to sell him. And the story around soccer is that there may not be a club that both wants Ronaldo and can afford his wages. Sky Sports says to not completely rule out Atletico Madrid, but there’s a massive portion of the supporter base that doesn’t want the club’s longtime massive rival. Wouldn’t it be hilarious to see Ronaldo and Diego Simeone respecting each other? Seems like a recipe for success, doesn’t it?Ronaldo wants to play in the Champions League and compete for major trophies. So does every other player in the world. It looks, for the moment, that he’s going to have to come to terms with the fact that he’s not bigger than the club, and you have to think that United would be thrilled find a buyer for him regardless of its public stance. If there’s a player in the world capable of short-circuiting Erik ten Hag’s project, he’s the one oft-mentioned in this article. (NM)July 27 – Done deal: Lisandro Martinez deal completeNow, we knew this deal was all but confirmed but now it is officially official: Lisandro Martinez is a Manchester United player. The Argentine international, 24, has joined United for a fee of $68.7 million and has signed a five-year contract with the option of an extra year. Martinez starred for Ajax last season as he was their player of the season under Erik ten Hag, and he now links up with his former manager to help usher in a new era at Old Trafford.Martinez is exactly the kind of player United needed, as he will bring a calmness, authority and class to their defense. Able to play as a center back or at left back, Martinez will slot straight into this team and it will be intriguing to see if Harry Maguire loses his place or if Martinez initially plays at left back or ETH switches United to three at the back. Wherever Martinez plays, he brings quality to United and along with the signings of Christian Eriksen and Tyrell Malacia, there is a clear identity to the new players the Red Devils are signing. (JPW)\n🔥 Feel the fire.\n🔴 @LisandrMartinez is ready to bring the heat to United.#MUFC\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 27, 2022July 27 – Ronaldo running out of optionsIn the last few hours both Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid have talked down the idea of signing Cristiano Ronaldo. Basically, they’ve both said it isn’t going to happen. Bayern Munich director Oliver Kahn had the following to say about reports linking the German champs to Ronaldo: “We discussed about Cristiano Ronaldo internally – I consider him one of greatest footballers ever. Then we came to conclusion that, despite appreciation for Cristiano, he would not fit into our philosophy in the current situation.”That came hours after Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo said this about reports linking Real Madrid legend Ronaldo with an audacious move to his former crosstown rivals: “I’ve already said this several times, I don’t know who invented the Cristiano story but I’ll tell you that it’s practically impossible that he comes to Atletico de Madrid. Rumors are rumors and they have to stay as rumors. If you keep on fuelling the rumors then eventually it will look like it’s something real, which it’s not.”Ronaldo, 37, is back in Manchester at United’s Carrington training ground and is reportedly still set on leaving United this summer. But where on earth will he go? If his dream is to remain in the UEFA Champions League, there are very few options for him to join a team in the UCL which will be able to compete to win it. PSG seems like a no-go. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich all seem like no-go’s too. Of the 26 teams who have qualified for the Champions League group stage this season, perhaps his best option is a return to Portugal to play for Sporting Lisbon? They will do well to get out of the group stage, though, so would that be worth it for Ronaldo? United seem to be set on keeping Ronaldo for this season but if he doesn’t want to be there, is that a big mistake? We will find out much more in the coming days and it will be intriguing to see if Ronaldo is in the United squad for their opener against Brighton in 9 days’ time. (JPW)July 26 – Ronaldo arrives at United’s training ground for talksBlink and you’ll miss him, but the video below shows Cristiano Ronaldo arriving at Manchester United’s training ground for the first time this summer. With just over a week to go until the new season kicks off, Erik ten Hag will sit down with Ronaldo to discuss his plans and try to convince him to stay at United. Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo’s agent, was shown alongside him in the car and it was reported that Sir Alex Ferguson also arrived at the Carrington training base but our partners in the UK at Sky Sports say he was not involved in talks. Ronaldo, 37, is running out of options for a move away this summer as Bayern Munich and Chelsea both opted out of moving for the Portuguese superstar. Ronaldo reportedly wants to leave United in order to play in the UEFA Champions League. With Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho excelling as a front three in preseason for United, it may be tough for Ronaldo to actually get into this new-look United side early in the season. But, after all, he is Cristiano Ronaldo and if ETH convinces him to be a part of his plans, then surely he will play a big part in the 2022-23 campaign.

According to a report from David Ornstein, Ronaldo is traveling back to England and expected to meet with Man United executives as well as, eventually, new manager Erik ten Hag. The key line, from Ornstein’s report: (AE)Sources around the matter suggest it is increasingly likely that Ronaldo remains at United, but there is still a lack of clarity about the situation.July 19 – Cristiano Ronaldo saga rumbles on as Atletico Madrid linkedCristiano Ronaldo, 37, is running out of places to move to this summer as Chelsea and Bayern Munich are out, while PSG seems very unlikely. According to a report from AS in Spain, a return to the Spanish capital could be on the cards but no, not to Real Madrid. Per the report, Ronaldo and his representatives have been contacted by Atletico Madrid and Diego Simeone really wants to sign him. As a Real Madrid legend, how would fans of Atleti take this one? If it helps them challenge for trophies in Spain and Europe then they would probably accept it. Could Ronaldo have a similar impact to Luis Suarez turning up in 2020 to help them win the Spanish title? Potentially. Still, it’s tough to see Ronaldo lining up in the red and white stripes of the team he tormented so often during his nine-year stay at Real.The Portuguese superstar is still wanted by Man United and Erik ten Hag has gone as far as stating that Ronaldo is in his plans for this season and he could see Ronaldo extending his contract for another year (which he holds the option to do so) after a positive 2022-23 campaign. That seems unlikely as Ronaldo clearly wants to leave and although it is just preseason, Erik ten Hag’s front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho seem to be a very good fit as a unit. The kicker to all of this is that either Ronaldo would have to significantly reduce his wage demands or Atletico would have to offload plenty of other forwards just to afford him, with Alvaro Morata and Angel Correa potentially being sold. Is Ronaldo worth it for Atletico? If Simeone thinks he can add the goals and cutting edge his team is sometime lacking and can slot in to their high-pressing, manic style of play, who are we to disagree? (JPW)July 17 – Manchester United reach agreement with Ajax for Lisandro MartinezArsenal were first linked with him this summer, but Lisandro Martinez appears headed for Manchester United instead after the Red Devils announced on Sunday that a $65.3-million agreement had been reached with Ajax. The 24-year-old center is expected to sign for Man United upon agreeing personal terms and/or completing a medical. (AE)\nAn agreement has been reached for the transfer of Lisandro Martinez 🔴🇦🇷#MUFC || @LisandrMartinez\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 17, 2022July 15 – Christian Eriksen signs for Manchester UnitedChristian Eriksen, 30, has signed for Manchester United as a free agent. The Danish playmaker has finally completed the move and he has signed a three-year contract at Old Trafford. This is another big move for the Red Devils as Eriksen will play a key role in helping Erik ten Hag implement his playing style.Eriksen said the following about his arrival at Old Trafford: “Manchester United is a special club, and I cannot wait to get started. I have had the privilege of playing at Old Trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of United will be an amazing feeling.“I have seen Erik’s work at Ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. It is clear that he is a fantastic coach. Having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, I am even more excited for the future. I still have major ambitions in the game, there is a huge amount that I know I can achieve, and this is the perfect place to continue my journey.”This is a superb free transfer from United and Eriksen showed his quality in the second half of last season at Brentford. His intelligence on the ball and ability to play in a variety of roles across midfield and attack will be invaluable for United. So too will his experience as United have a world-class midfielder ready to help make them tick. Now, how will ETH fit Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes and potentially Frenkie de Jong into the same team? Eriksen could play a slightly deeper role and at this stage of his career, that would be perfect for him to dictate the tempo of the game and help United keep the ball. (JPW)July 15 – Lisandro Martinez deal is done for $55.4 millionManchester United continue to head to the Netherlands for their new players as Ajax and Argentina defender Lisandro Martinez is about to join. Erik ten Hag was a huge fan of Martinez during his time at Ajax and the versatile defender (he can play center back or left back) will be key in improving this United defense. With Tyrell Malacia already arriving, the left-sided of United’s defense could have a totally new look this season. Martinez was chased by Arsenal for most of this summer but Martinez has decided to join United to work with ETH once again. (JPW)\nLisandro Martínez to Manchester United, here we go! Full agreement in place between Man United and Ajax for package up to €55m.

Ten Hag, big factor. pic.twitter.com/qyYskmgNMU\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) July 15, 2022July 15 – Frenkie de Jong saga takes another twistThis is rumbling on and on isn’t it? Frenkie de Jong doesn’t really want to leave Barcelona (at least that is how it seems from the reports in Spain) and this deal is being made more complicated because the Dutch international is owed over $20 million in wages by Barcelona. Those wages were deferred during the start of the pandemic to help the Catalan club with soaring costs but have yet to be repaid. United have apparently agreed a transfer fee with Barcelona to sign De Jong but the Dutch midfielder isn’t going to leave the Nou Camp without his previous wages being paid. What a mess. (JPW)July 5 – Andreas Pereira leaving Man United, will stay in Premier LeagueThere had been four loans for Andreas Pereira since the Brazilian joined Manchester United’s academy in 2012, but the now 26-year-old looks set to leave Old Trafford for good.Pereira is headed for Fulham, according to reports, with approximately $12 million coming back the other way from the newly-promoted side.He has just finished a year on loan to Brazil’s Flamengo, having scored nine times with three assists after spending the previous year on loan to Serie A side Lazio.Pereira had his busiest year at United before that, playing 25 PL matches and 15 cup matches in 2019-20. Loans to Valencia and Granada predated that. (NM)July 5 – Done deal! Tyrell Malacia signs for Manchester UnitedThe first signing of the Erik ten Hag era is confirmed, as left back Tyrell Malacia has arrived from Feyenoord for up to $17.5 million. The Dutch international, 22, will compete with Luke Shaw for a starting spot and has signed a four-year contract with an option to extend for a further year. Malacia is an attack-minded full back and played a key role in Feyenoord reaching the UEFA Conference League final last season, as he also broke into the Dutch national team and knows all about Erik ten Hag’s playing philosophy. With United reportedly closing in on deals to sign Christian Eriksen and Frenkie de Jong too, the ETH era is building some momentum. Now, just to sort out what’s going on with this Ronaldo chap… (JPW)\n✋ Stop scrolling.👇 Watch this.\n@T_Malacia's first interview has landed 🛬🔴#MUFC || #WelkomTyrell\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 5, 2022July 4 – Cristiano Ronaldo fails to turn up for preseason due to ‘family reasons’Our partners in the UK at Sky Sports have confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo, 37, has not arrived at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground for the first day of preseason. Why? The reports say there are ‘family reasons’ why Ronaldo hasn’t returned on time and that the club are happy with that reason and all is well. In reality, this slots in with Ronaldo reportedly asking to be sold this summer if an acceptable offer arrives. He has just one year left on his contract but the club are apparently unwilling to sell him and plan on him being around this season.With United scheduled to fly to Asia and Australia for their preseason tour in the coming days, it is clear that Ronaldo is having serious doubts about the Erik ten Hag era and wants a move. Most of United’s squad returned to training last week and other international players (aside from Ronaldo) arrived on Monday morning to being preseason. In the next few days we are about to find out if this saga will take another twist as reports suggest ETH will sit down with Ronaldo and try to work out any issues he has about the season ahead. (JPW)July 4 – Christian Eriksen agrees to Manchester United moveChristian Eriksen has agreed to move to Manchester United in a big boost for new manager Erik ten Hag. According to David Ornstein from The Athletic, the Danish playmaker has agreed to a three-year contract at Old Trafford. The free agent, 30, will now undergo a medical before linking up with Erik ten Hag’s side. Eriksen had been wanted by Tottenham, Brentford (where he spent the second half of last season on a short-term deal) and many others, but he’s picked United who seem him as being key to ushering in Erik ten Hag’s possession-based style. The fact Eriksen came through the ranks at Ajax will no doubt be helpful in totally understanding ETH’s methods and ushering in a new era at United.Is this a good move for all involved? United will get a quality player who has real class on set pieces and can dictate the tempo of the game. Eriksen could play in a slightly deeper role to slot into the starting lineup alongside Frenkie de Jong and Bruno Fernandes but that would still be a pretty attack-minded midfield trio. Anyway, wherever he plays Eriksen will deliver goals and assists and this is a savvy signing by United as they aren’t paying a transfer fee. For Eriksen, he will get to playing regularly at one of the top clubs in the world as this is what his talent deserves. After his incredible comeback from a cardiac arrest in the summer of 2021, he oozed class at Brentford over the final months of the 2021-22 season. (JPW)July 2 – Ronaldo wants to leave Manchester United – Where could he go?Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly asked to leave Manchester United if they receive a suitable offer for him this summer. Ronaldo, 37, has been linked with moves to several top teams in recent weeks as doubts persisted over whether or not he would fit into the system of new Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag.It appears those doubts could spell the end for Ronaldo’s second spell at Manchester United. A report from The Times states that Ronaldo wants to leave United this summer as the report says he wants to return to play in the UEFA Champions League and challenge for trophies. Napoli, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Roma have been linked with a move for Ronaldo in recent weeks.After this initial report came out, our partners in the UK at Sky Sports state that Manchester United do not want to sell Ronaldo and have no interest in letting him leave this summer.The legendary striker scored 24 goals in all competitions for Manchester United in their dire 2021-2022 season but despite his heroics in front of goal, many questioned if his playing style and personality had an overall negative impact on the Red Devils. Even if he doesn’t slot into Erik ten Hag’s long-term plans, replacing his goals will be a huge issue and United’s new manager may already have a big problem to solve. (JPW)July 2 – Battle for Lisandro Martinez is well and truly onA report from Dutch outlet De Telegraaf states that Manchester United are trying to pip Arsenal to the signing of Argentine defender Lisandro Martinez. United have reportedly made a $47 million bid for the 24-year-old (who can play center back or left back) and are pushing Arsenal all the way to try and sign the Ajax star. Martinez of course worked with United’s new manager, Erik ten Hag, at Ajax and proved himself to be one of their most important players in recent seasons.His ability to be aggressive defensively but also have poise on the ball is exactly what ETH is looking for. With United chasing Frenkie de Jong and Antony, plus giving Donny van de Beek a second chance at the club, the Ajax vibes will be strong at Old Trafford this season. Do United really need a left-sided defender, though? Luke Shaw and Alex Telles are their current left back options, while Harry Maguire is the left-sided center back. Does this push for Martinez tell us one, or more, of those players is leaving this summer? (JPW)July 2 – Dean Henderson signs for Nottingham Forest on loanPremier League new boys Nottingham Forest have picked up a top quality goalkeeper on loan for the season. Dean Henderson, 25, has joined Forest from Manchester United in a straight loan deal. Henderson previously excelled while on loan at Sheffield United but he hasn’t been able to claim the starting spot ahead of David de Gea since returning to Old Trafford. Henderson had plenty of interest and he will use this move to Forest to try and earn a spot in Gareth Southgate’s 2022 World Cup squad as he will play week in, week out in the Premier League. Steve Cooper and Forest are making some impressive moves this summer as they aim to cement themselves as a top-flight club.

According to reports, Pogba and Juventus have agreed terms, as he inches toward completing the second free transfer from Manchester United to Juventus in his career. Juventus won the Serie A title all four seasons he spent at Juventus, from 2012-2016, plus a pair of Coppa Italia triumphs as well. In six seasons (back) at Man United, Pogba won the Europa League and the League Cup once each. (AE)June 14 – Nemanja Matic rejoins Jose Mourinho (again) at RomaFor the third time in his career, Nemanja Matic has signed to play for Jose Mourinho, this time at Roma, after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer. The 33-year-old signed a one-year contract and will presumably slot straight into defensive midfield for 36 of 38 games next season.

His ball progression numbers are outlandish in nearly 2.5 seasons with the Bundesliga outfit, and Ten Hag is said to have wanted to bring him to Old Trafford last summer, too. (NM)\nBenfica and Portugal forward Goncalo Ramos has emerged as a top target for Manchester United this summer. According to a report from Record in Portugal, United want to sign Ramos as they need a new man to lead their attack. Per the report, Ramos has a release clause of $130 million in his contract. Given that Manchester United would have to pay a similar fee for Harry Kane and a deal for Kane would prove very difficult given Spurs’ reluctance to sell to a Premier League rivals, perhaps a move for Ramos, 21, is more attainable?\nIt would slot in with their philosophy of buying young emerging talents such as Jadon Sancho and Antony in recent windows and Ramos’ style of play would suit Erik ten Hag and United well. With injury issues to Anthony Martial throughout this season and Wout Weghorst expected to return to Burnley when his loan ends this summer, only Marcus Rashford is around to lead the charge up top. Even he is better starting out on the left so signing a new striker is a priority for ETH this summer and Ramos is experienced enough at a very young age, but also on the way up with plenty of room for improvement, to suggest he would be the perfect long-term option.

According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Wout Weghorst terminated his loan deal with Besiktas, completed his medical and officially joined Manchester United on loan. It was widely reported that United have paid $3.2 million in compensation to Besiktas to sign Weghorst on loan from Burnley until the summer. Erik ten Hag wanted an extra forward option and the 30-year-old Dutch striker is his man. Weghorst will give United something totally different and his hold-up play should suit their style of play extremely well. (JPW/AE)\nOkay, this is pretty wild, but reports from Turkish journalist Gokhan Dinc state that Wout Weghorst is ready to pay compensation to Besiktas so he can rip up his loan deal with them and head to Manchester United. That’s right, the 30-year-old Dutch forward will dip into his own pocket to pay the termination fee to the Turkish giants who have an agreement with Burnley to loan him for this season. With Manchester United coming in for Weghorst and wanting to loan him until the summer, the forward is said to be desperate to join the Red Devils and even waved goodbye to Besiktas fans after scoring his most recent goal for them. This is fast moving but Weghorst was pictured training with Besiktas in photos released on Tuesday, so it appears there is still a little way to go in this one. (JPW)\nTurkish giants Besiktas have released a statement saying there will be no imminent move from Burnley to Manchester United for their on-loan striker Wout Weghorst. They added that reports suggesting it is possible to get Weghorst out of his loan deal to them for $3 million are wide of the mark. The Dutch forward is subject of serious interest from United as a loan signing until the end of the season as Erik ten Hag looks to boost his attacking options.\nWeghorst is currently on loan at Besiktas from Burnley but the Turkish Super Lig side want to be compensated if Burnley decides to recall him and then he heads to United. The Dutch international, 30, has scored eight goals in 16 league games for Besiktas this season and they are extremely reluctant to let him go. Weghorst will give United an aerial threat up top, plus he can hold up the ball, link play and Erik ten Hag knows him extremely well. Per a report from ESPN, Weghorst is the short-term solution and in the summer United will try to sign Harry Kane, Benjamin Sesko or Victor Osimhen. That trio are the long-term options for United to build their attack around but in the meantime they certainly need to add one forward who is something different to what they already have and can help them in the League Cup, FA Cup, Europa League and Premier League grind. (JPW)\nEarlier this week, Erik ten Hag made Manchester United’s January intentions very clear: “We are looking for a striker,” he said. According to multiple reports, the Red Devils are in talks with Burnley over Dutch forward Wout Weghorst, who is currently on loan to Besiktas. To facilitate a move to Old Trafford — temporary or otherwise — Burnley would have to recall Weghorst from his loan spell in Turkey. (AE)\nAccording to The Telegraph Jack Butland, still just 29 years old, is in talks about signing for Manchester United. Butland is currently the back-up goalkeeper at Crystal Palace but with Martin Dubravka recalled by Newcastle United from his loan at Manchester United, the Red Devils need an extra goalkeeper to step in for David de Gea when needed. They currently have Tom Heaton as their other goalkeeping option.\nButland is an England international who suffered a serious ankle injury just when he was pushing to become England’s No. 1 but he still made the 2018 World Cup squad. He was relegated with Stoke City just before the World Cup and battled it out with them in the Championship before moving to Crystal Palace in 2020 to try and revive his career. He has six months left on his contract at Palace and remains behind Vicente Guaita in the pecking order so swapping a back-up role at Palace for a back-up role at United is a pretty decent move. Butland will likely play in FA Cup, League Cup and perhaps some Europa League games for United and with David de Gea’s future not certain, perhaps a spot could open up for him to fully revive his career? (JPW)\nWith a top-four place very much within reach, Erik ten Hag has confirmed Manchester United’s top January priority: a striker.\n“We are looking for offensive players. We are looking for a striker. We are always in the market but it has to match the sporting criteria — also the financial criteria. We do what we can to bring in the players we need.”\nDiscussions about a new center forward at Manchester United had become commonplace even before it cut ties with Cristiano Ronaldo but another left winger (who, yes, also plays some center forward)?\nFree-scoring Rennes forward Martin Terrier is said to be a target for United as well as Tottenham Hotspur as both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the Ligue 1 outfit regarding the 25-year-old. Price tag? It reportedly starts around $38 million.\nTerrier has become a regular amongst the Ligue 1 scoring charts, bagging 21 goals last season and already delivering eight in 14 matches this season. He’s chipped in three goals in Europa League and also had provided 11 assists across all competitions since the start of last season.\nVery strong in the air and a good passer to boot, Terrier is an expected goals and assists monster who could combine with Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, and Anthony Martial (plus others) to haunt Premier League defenses. Problem is, might he match up just as well with Harry Kane and Tottenham? Antonio Conte is said to be on the case. (NM)\nUPDATE: Gakpo has signed for Liverpool\nPSV Eindhoven held onto young Cody Gakpo this summer and the Dutch club looks fit to reap the rewards as it holds out for a club record transfer fee.\nThat wouldn’t be a problem for Man United if it goes for Gakpo, who has been rated at $50 million-plus and that fee has not been a problem in the past. According to talkSPORT, United are ‘desperate’ to sign Gakpo in January.\nThere are some Robin van Persie qualities in the 23-year-old’s game, but Gakpo will be hoping to find RVP’s highs and reproduce them more often in his career.\nGakpo stands 6-foot-2 and often comes off the left wing, scoring three goals in five appearances at the 2022 World Cup.\nThe Netherlands star has an almost-absurd nine goals and 12 assists in 14 Eredivisie minutes this young season, chipping in three more goals and two assists in the Europa League.\nHe’d join Lisandro Martinez, Antony, and Tyrell Malacia as imports from the Netherlands’ top flight. (NM)\nNote the vowel: This is not about Diego Costa, now at Wolves.\nNo, it’s DIogo Costa, who was Portugal’s goalkeeper at the recently-completed World Cup in Qatar and apparently got tongues wagging around Old Trafford.\nBut the Red Devils would have to wait until summer, according to a report translated by Sky Sports, and they will have to pay Porto big bucks.\nAccording to Portuguese outlet\xa0Correio da Manha, Costa will not be allowed to leave Porto in January and any move in the summer would require United to pay the full €75m (£65m) to release him.\nThe Swiss-born 23-year-old has 11 caps for Portugal and allowed just six goals in five matches in Qatar. Costa has appeared for Portugal at the U15-U21 levels and also performed for the Olympic team.\nIn\nLisandro Martinez – Ajax ($68.7 million)\nTyrell Malacia – Feyenoord ($13.2 million, plus $2 million possible add-ons)\nChristian Eriksen – Free\nCasemiro\xa0 – Real Madrid ($70 million)\nAntony – Ajax ($103 million)\nMartin Dubravka – Newcastle United (loan – $3.5 million fee)\nOut\nAndreas Pereira – Fulham ($11.9 million)\nDean Henderson – Nottingham Forest (loan)\nPaul Pogba (end of contract)\nNemanja Matic – Roma (free transfer)\nJuan Mata (end of contract)\nEdinson Cavani (end of contract)\nJesse Lingard (end of contract)\nLee Grant (end of contract)\nEric Bailly – Marseille (loan – $3 million fee)\nErik ten Hag has said he expects Cristiano Ronaldo to stay at Manchester United as the transfer deadline ticks down, while the Dutch coach also confirmed that winger Antony and goalkeeper Martin Dubravka will be United’s final pieces of business in the summer window.\nRonaldo, 37, has been linked with a move away all summer as it is believed he wanted to move on and play for a team in the Champions League. However, no deals have been lined up for him and Erik ten Hag and United have always stated that they want Ronaldo to stay. It seems like they may win this battle as the only real options left are Sporting Lisbon and Napoli on loan, and even those two deals seem very tough to get done with just over 24 hours to go in the summer window.\n“It’s clear, of course. We need quality players,” Erik ten Hag said when asked about Ronaldo staying at United.\xa0“You need more to cover all the games to keep the consistency going, that’s what we strive for.”\nIf he doesn’t leave, let’s see how Ronaldo reacts to being a bit-part played at United over the next few months… (JPW)\nBrazilian winger Antony, 22, will be on his way to Manchester shortly for his medical, according to Fabrizio Romano. After United and Ajax finally agreed a fee of $100 million (after a little push from Antony as he expressed his desire to leave the Amsterdam club), Antony is now ready to head to Manchester to complete the formalities of this huge deal. Do United need a winger? Probably not. But Antony’s arrival would add another attacking player who is able to play across the front line and United’s forward unit would become even more flexible. (JPW)\nManchester United are planning for Antony's arrival and medical tests, while contracts have been approved by clubs and player side.

Casemiro recently held talks with the Real Madrid hierarchy and indicated that he “wants a new challenge” at this point in his career. According to reports, Casemiro’s contract will pay him just short of $450,000 per week ($23.4 million annually), marking significant investment in a vitally important position as Erik ten Hag tries to right a wayward ship. The transfer fee is reportedly $70.9 million with another $11.8 million possible in add-ons.

The only problem, at least thus far, is that Dest doesn’t necessarily want to leave Catalonia. Now, according to a report from the Independent‘s Miguel Delaney, Manchester United and new manager Erik ten Hag are “making progress” on a deal to bring Dest to Old Trafford. Dest played two seasons under Ten Hag at Ajax, from 2019-2021. (AE)\nAm told United are making progress on Dest, toohttps://t.co/Yt69LKlvQW\n— Miguel Delaney (@MiguelDelaney) August 19, 2022\n\nThe reports that Christian Pulisic is a loan target for Manchester United are swirling but both the BBC and Sky Sports believe a loan move for the USMNT star to United is very unlikely. Why? Well, Chelsea don’t want to strengthen a potential top four rival by letting the 23-year-old join them. Per the latest reports, Chelsea would prefer to sell Pulisic on a permanent deal or they may want him to extend his contract with them first before loaning him so his market value remains high. It seems unlikely that United, or any other club, will pay what Chelsea want for Pulisic as the American winger has just under two years left on his contract and the Blues are said to want to recoup most of the $70 million they paid for him in 2019. (JPW)\nAccording to a report from The Athletic’s David Ornstein, Manchester United’s main transfer target is now Casemiro from Real Madrid. The 30-year-old Brazilian midfielder has been a star at Real over the last nine years, winning five UEFA Champions League titles and his status as a Real legend is undoubted as he’s meshed so well with Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. Per the report, United have offered Casemiro huge wages and see him as being key to Erik ten Hag’s rebuild as he would give the team defensive stability in midfield. The midfielder is also said to be keen on a move (he’s been offered a five-year contract which will reportedly almost double his wages) and he has just under three years left on his current contract at Real Madrid. It is believed Casemiro would cost in the region of $70 million.\nWould Casemiro be a good fit? Of course he would. He would break up play, get attacks going and general dominate the engine room. However, he is just one of a few key players United need to sign between now and the end of the summer window. Erik ten Hag needs a deep-lying playmaker (ahem, Frenkie de Jong…) to sit alongside Casemiro as that means all of the tackles he wins will then be used effectively to start attacks. Perhaps Christian Eriksen alongside Casemiro would work? (JPW)\nCristiano Ronaldo is apparently keeping a notebook with all of his transfer rumors, as the egomaniac Portuguese megastar is reportedly moving closer to get his desired Manchester United exit, with the club reportedly now ready to sell him.\nRonaldo says that the media has been “telling lies” about him and his potential moves while promising that he will give an interview in two weeks’ time to give all the details of his summer. Does this mean he’s planning to stay, or just that he knows any Ronaldo transfer is going to take to the end of the transfer window?\nOur own Joe-Prince Wright has more on the story, here.\nWe couldn’t wait two weeks, so we went in a time machine and found it: “I will always love Manchester United and am sad to leave/excited to stay. Something about Sir Alex. GGMU.” (NM)\nManchester United has reportedly joined the list of clubs interested in taking USMNT winger Christian Pulisic on loan from Chelsea, and the player is said to be into the move.\nJuventus, Atletico Madrid, Newcastle United, and AC Milan have also been linked with Pulisic, who wants to stay at Chelsea but is anxious to leave Stamford Bridge in pursuit of playing time before the World Cup.\nUnited could pair Pulisic and Jadon Sancho on either side of a center forward, whether Anthony Martial, Cristiano Ronaldo, or even Marcus Rashford. A new face has been expected to join United at CF for some time, too.\nWhat does it say about the status of Manchester United that Chelsea would be open to the move? And to a lesser extent, what does it say about Thomas Tuchel’s view of Pulisic? (NM)\nBarcelona boss Xavi Hernandez needs players to leave in order to give him the freedom to register new players before the end of the window but Sergino Dest has so far shown desire to fight for his place.\nAnd so Dest’s omission from the 18 for Barcelona’s 0-0 draw with Rayo Vallecano on Saturday is reportedly intended to show the USMNT back his status in the pecking order, and now Man United is said to feel encouraged at their chances of wooing the player to Old Trafford.\nDest will surely want to play and Saturday could well serve as the intended wake-up call. Gregg Berhalter will be encouraging Dest to go somewhere he can play and United would provide that hope with reports of Diogo Dalot going the other way. With a pal in Frenkie de Jong continually linked with United, maybe having a teammate join them in the move could sway both to Manchester?\nWould it be good for Dest? Who knows? United is a mess right now but the player would be familiar with so many pieces at United including fellow ex-Ajax men Lisandro Martinez and Erik ten Hag.

Ronaldo made the announcement himself on Friday, via Instagram, commented “Domingo o rei joga” — “Sunday, the king plays.” It was reported earlier on Friday that the Portuguese superstar had been left out of Erik ten Hag’s squad for a friendly against Atletico Madrid on Saturday (in Oslo, Norway), but Ronaldo has indicated his return is slated for a friendly against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday (at Old Trafford). (AE)\nWe now that Cristiano Ronaldo wants out of Manchester United and his first-ever club, Sporting Lisbon, could be the solution. According to a report from The Athletic, Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, is in talks with the Sporting hierarchy over a potential deal. Ronaldo, 37, came up through the youth team at Sporting and left them for Manchester United when he was 18. Sporting finished second in the Portuguese top-flight last season, so are in the Champions League group stage and Ronaldo is adamant he wants to move to a club playing in the Champions League. So, in theory, this seems like a good fit. But financially there’s no way Sporting Lisbon could afford this move and Ronaldo will have to lower his wage demands massively.\nWith Atletico Madrid, Napoli, Bayern Munich and Chelsea all passing up on signing Ronaldo, the legendary forward has basically run out of other options to leave Manchester United this summer. There has been talk that United want Ronaldo to sign his option of an extra year on his contract (which will take him up to the summer of 2024) and he will then be loaned out to Sporting Lisbon for the 2022-23 season. That scenario still seems very unlikely but what other choice does Ronaldo have right now? He’s used to getting his own way when it comes to negotiations because, well, he’s Ronaldo. But Ronaldo and his representatives have badly miscalculated this one and Manchester United are holding firm as Erik ten Hag wants him in his plans for the 2022-23 campaign. (JPW)\nManchester United could not sell Cristiano Ronaldo on its project after crisis talks with the reportedly wantaway star, according to Sky Sports.\nRonaldo, 37, still wants to leave Old Trafford after flying into Manchester to meet with club hierarchy, but is now training with the team.\nThe reporting says Ronaldo wants to exit in order to join a UEFA Champions League club, and to be fair this is totally on-brand and what United should’ve expected when signing the Portuguese.\nBut that’s not changing United’s stance on Ronaldo, as they do not want to sell him. And the story around soccer is that there may not be a club that both wants Ronaldo and can afford his wages. Sky Sports says to not completely rule out Atletico Madrid, but there’s a massive portion of the supporter base that doesn’t want the club’s longtime massive rival. Wouldn’t it be hilarious to see Ronaldo and Diego Simeone respecting each other? Seems like a recipe for success, doesn’t it?\nRonaldo wants to play in the Champions League and compete for major trophies. So does every other player in the world. It looks, for the moment, that he’s going to have to come to terms with the fact that he’s not bigger than the club, and you have to think that United would be thrilled find a buyer for him regardless of its public stance. If there’s a player in the world capable of short-circuiting Erik ten Hag’s project, he’s the one oft-mentioned in this article. (NM)\nNow, we knew this deal was all but confirmed but now it is officially official: Lisandro Martinez is a Manchester United player. The Argentine international, 24, has joined United for a fee of $68.7 million and has signed a five-year contract with the option of an extra year. Martinez starred for Ajax last season as he was their player of the season under Erik ten Hag, and he now links up with his former manager to help usher in a new era at Old Trafford.\nMartinez is exactly the kind of player United needed, as he will bring a calmness, authority and class to their defense. Able to play as a center back or at left back, Martinez will slot straight into this team and it will be intriguing to see if Harry Maguire loses his place or if Martinez initially plays at left back or ETH switches United to three at the back. Wherever Martinez plays, he brings quality to United and along with the signings of Christian Eriksen and Tyrell Malacia, there is a clear identity to the new players the Red Devils are signing. (JPW)\n🔥 Feel the fire.\n🔴 @LisandrMartinez is ready to bring the heat to United.#MUFC\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 27, 2022\n\nIn the last few hours both Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid have talked down the idea of signing Cristiano Ronaldo. Basically, they’ve both said it isn’t going to happen. Bayern Munich director Oliver Kahn had the following to say about reports linking the German champs to Ronaldo: “We discussed about Cristiano Ronaldo internally – I consider him one of greatest footballers ever. Then we came to conclusion that, despite appreciation for Cristiano, he would not fit into our philosophy in the current situation.”\nThat came hours after Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo said this about reports linking Real Madrid legend Ronaldo with an audacious move to his former crosstown rivals: “I’ve already said this several times, I don’t know who invented the Cristiano story but I’ll tell you that it’s practically impossible that he comes to Atletico de Madrid. Rumors are rumors and they have to stay as rumors. If you keep on fuelling the rumors then eventually it will look like it’s something real, which it’s not.”\nRonaldo, 37, is back in Manchester at United’s Carrington training ground and is reportedly still set on leaving United this summer. But where on earth will he go? If his dream is to remain in the UEFA Champions League, there are very few options for him to join a team in the UCL which will be able to compete to win it. PSG seems like a no-go. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Juventus and Bayern Munich all seem like no-go’s too. Of the 26 teams who have qualified for the Champions League group stage this season, perhaps his best option is a return to Portugal to play for Sporting Lisbon? They will do well to get out of the group stage, though, so would that be worth it for Ronaldo? United seem to be set on keeping Ronaldo for this season but if he doesn’t want to be there, is that a big mistake? We will find out much more in the coming days and it will be intriguing to see if Ronaldo is in the United squad for their opener against Brighton in 9 days’ time. (JPW)\nBlink and you’ll miss him, but the video below shows Cristiano Ronaldo arriving at Manchester United’s training ground for the first time this summer. With just over a week to go until the new season kicks off, Erik ten Hag will sit down with Ronaldo to discuss his plans and try to convince him to stay at United. Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo’s agent, was shown alongside him in the car and it was reported that Sir Alex Ferguson also arrived at the Carrington training base but our partners in the UK at Sky Sports say he was not involved in talks. Ronaldo, 37, is running out of options for a move away this summer as Bayern Munich and Chelsea both opted out of moving for the Portuguese superstar. Ronaldo reportedly wants to leave United in order to play in the UEFA Champions League. With Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho excelling as a front three in preseason for United, it may be tough for Ronaldo to actually get into this new-look United side early in the season. But, after all, he is Cristiano Ronaldo and if ETH convinces him to be a part of his plans, then surely he will play a big part in the 2022-23 campaign.

According to a report from David Ornstein, Ronaldo is traveling back to England and expected to meet with Man United executives as well as, eventually, new manager Erik ten Hag. The key line, from Ornstein’s report: (AE)\nSources around the matter suggest it is increasingly likely that Ronaldo remains at United, but there is still a lack of clarity about the situation.\nCristiano Ronaldo, 37, is running out of places to move to this summer as Chelsea and Bayern Munich are out, while PSG seems very unlikely. According to a report from AS in Spain, a return to the Spanish capital could be on the cards but no, not to Real Madrid. Per the report, Ronaldo and his representatives have been contacted by Atletico Madrid and Diego Simeone really wants to sign him. As a Real Madrid legend, how would fans of Atleti take this one? If it helps them challenge for trophies in Spain and Europe then they would probably accept it. Could Ronaldo have a similar impact to Luis Suarez turning up in 2020 to help them win the Spanish title? Potentially. Still, it’s tough to see Ronaldo lining up in the red and white stripes of the team he tormented so often during his nine-year stay at Real.\nThe Portuguese superstar is still wanted by Man United and Erik ten Hag has gone as far as stating that Ronaldo is in his plans for this season and he could see Ronaldo extending his contract for another year (which he holds the option to do so) after a positive 2022-23 campaign. That seems unlikely as Ronaldo clearly wants to leave and although it is just preseason, Erik ten Hag’s front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho seem to be a very good fit as a unit. The kicker to all of this is that either Ronaldo would have to significantly reduce his wage demands or Atletico would have to offload plenty of other forwards just to afford him, with Alvaro Morata and Angel Correa potentially being sold. Is Ronaldo worth it for Atletico? If Simeone thinks he can add the goals and cutting edge his team is sometime lacking and can slot in to their high-pressing, manic style of play, who are we to disagree? (JPW)\nArsenal were first linked with him this summer, but Lisandro Martinez appears headed for Manchester United instead after the Red Devils announced on Sunday that a $65.3-million agreement had been reached with Ajax. The 24-year-old center is expected to sign for Man United upon agreeing personal terms and/or completing a medical. (AE)\nAn agreement has been reached for the transfer of Lisandro Martinez 🔴🇦🇷#MUFC || @LisandrMartinez\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 17, 2022\n\nChristian Eriksen, 30, has signed for Manchester United as a free agent. The Danish playmaker has finally completed the move and he has signed a three-year contract at Old Trafford. This is another big move for the Red Devils as Eriksen will play a key role in helping Erik ten Hag implement his playing style.\nEriksen said the following about his arrival at Old Trafford: “Manchester United is a special club, and I cannot wait to get started. I have had the privilege of playing at Old Trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of United will be an amazing feeling.\n“I have seen Erik’s work at Ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. It is clear that he is a fantastic coach. Having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, I am even more excited for the future. I still have major ambitions in the game, there is a huge amount that I know I can achieve, and this is the perfect place to continue my journey.”\nThis is a superb free transfer from United and Eriksen showed his quality in the second half of last season at Brentford. His intelligence on the ball and ability to play in a variety of roles across midfield and attack will be invaluable for United. So too will his experience as United have a world-class midfielder ready to help make them tick. Now, how will ETH fit Eriksen, Bruno Fernandes and potentially Frenkie de Jong into the same team? Eriksen could play a slightly deeper role and at this stage of his career, that would be perfect for him to dictate the tempo of the game and help United keep the ball. (JPW)\nManchester United continue to head to the Netherlands for their new players as Ajax and Argentina defender Lisandro Martinez is about to join. Erik ten Hag was a huge fan of Martinez during his time at Ajax and the versatile defender (he can play center back or left back) will be key in improving this United defense. With Tyrell Malacia already arriving, the left-sided of United’s defense could have a totally new look this season. Martinez was chased by Arsenal for most of this summer but Martinez has decided to join United to work with ETH once again. (JPW)\nLisandro Martínez to Manchester United, here we go!

Frenkie de Jong doesn’t really want to leave Barcelona (at least that is how it seems from the reports in Spain) and this deal is being made more complicated because the Dutch international is owed over $20 million in wages by Barcelona. Those wages were deferred during the start of the pandemic to help the Catalan club with soaring costs but have yet to be repaid. United have apparently agreed a transfer fee with Barcelona to sign De Jong but the Dutch midfielder isn’t going to leave the Nou Camp without his previous wages being paid. What a mess. (JPW)\nThere had been four loans for Andreas Pereira since the Brazilian joined Manchester United’s academy in 2012, but the now 26-year-old looks set to leave Old Trafford for good.\nPereira is headed for Fulham, according to reports, with approximately $12 million coming back the other way from the newly-promoted side.\nHe has just finished a year on loan to Brazil’s Flamengo, having scored nine times with three assists after spending the previous year on loan to Serie A side Lazio.\nPereira had his busiest year at United before that, playing 25 PL matches and 15 cup matches in 2019-20. Loans to Valencia and Granada predated that. (NM)\nThe first signing of the Erik ten Hag era is confirmed, as left back Tyrell Malacia has arrived from Feyenoord for up to $17.5 million. The Dutch international, 22, will compete with Luke Shaw for a starting spot and has signed a four-year contract with an option to extend for a further year. Malacia is an attack-minded full back and played a key role in Feyenoord reaching the UEFA Conference League final last season, as he also broke into the Dutch national team and knows all about Erik ten Hag’s playing philosophy. With United reportedly closing in on deals to sign Christian Eriksen and Frenkie de Jong too, the ETH era is building some momentum. Now, just to sort out what’s going on with this Ronaldo chap… (JPW)\n✋ Stop scrolling.👇 Watch this.\n@T_Malacia's first interview has landed 🛬🔴#MUFC || #WelkomTyrell\n— Manchester United (@ManUtd) July 5, 2022\n\nOur partners in the UK at Sky Sports have confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo, 37, has not arrived at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground for the first day of preseason. Why? The reports say there are ‘family reasons’ why Ronaldo hasn’t returned on time and that the club are happy with that reason and all is well. In reality, this slots in with Ronaldo reportedly asking to be sold this summer if an acceptable offer arrives. He has just one year left on his contract but the club are apparently unwilling to sell him and plan on him being around this season.\nWith United scheduled to fly to Asia and Australia for their preseason tour in the coming days, it is clear that Ronaldo is having serious doubts about the Erik ten Hag era and wants a move. Most of United’s squad returned to training last week and other international players (aside from Ronaldo) arrived on Monday morning to being preseason. In the next few days we are about to find out if this saga will take another twist as reports suggest ETH will sit down with Ronaldo and try to work out any issues he has about the season ahead. (JPW)\nChristian Eriksen has agreed to move to Manchester United in a big boost for new manager Erik ten Hag. According to David Ornstein from The Athletic, the Danish playmaker has agreed to a three-year contract at Old Trafford. The free agent, 30, will now undergo a medical before linking up with Erik ten Hag’s side. Eriksen had been wanted by Tottenham, Brentford (where he spent the second half of last season on a short-term deal) and many others, but he’s picked United who seem him as being key to ushering in Erik ten Hag’s possession-based style. The fact Eriksen came through the ranks at Ajax will no doubt be helpful in totally understanding ETH’s methods and ushering in a new era at United.\nIs this a good move for all involved? United will get a quality player who has real class on set pieces and can dictate the tempo of the game. Eriksen could play in a slightly deeper role to slot into the starting lineup alongside Frenkie de Jong and Bruno Fernandes but that would still be a pretty attack-minded midfield trio. Anyway, wherever he plays Eriksen will deliver goals and assists and this is a savvy signing by United as they aren’t paying a transfer fee. For Eriksen, he will get to playing regularly at one of the top clubs in the world as this is what his talent deserves. After his incredible comeback from a cardiac arrest in the summer of 2021, he oozed class at Brentford over the final months of the 2021-22 season. (JPW)\nCristiano Ronaldo has reportedly asked to leave Manchester United if they receive a suitable offer for him this summer. Ronaldo, 37, has been linked with moves to several top teams in recent weeks as doubts persisted over whether or not he would fit into the system of new Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag.\nIt appears those doubts could spell the end for Ronaldo’s second spell at Manchester United. A report from The Times states that Ronaldo wants to leave United this summer as the report says he wants to return to play in the UEFA Champions League and challenge for trophies. Napoli, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Roma have been linked with a move for Ronaldo in recent weeks.\nAfter this initial report came out, our partners in the UK at Sky Sports state that Manchester United do not want to sell Ronaldo and have no interest in letting him leave this summer.\nThe legendary striker scored 24 goals in all competitions for Manchester United in their dire 2021-2022 season but despite his heroics in front of goal, many questioned if his playing style and personality had an overall negative impact on the Red Devils. Even if he doesn’t slot into Erik ten Hag’s long-term plans, replacing his goals will be a huge issue and United’s new manager may already have a big problem to solve. (JPW)\nA report from Dutch outlet De Telegraaf states that Manchester United are trying to pip Arsenal to the signing of Argentine defender Lisandro Martinez. United have reportedly made a $47 million bid for the 24-year-old (who can play center back or left back) and are pushing Arsenal all the way to try and sign the Ajax star. Martinez of course worked with United’s new manager, Erik ten Hag, at Ajax and proved himself to be one of their most important players in recent seasons.\nHis ability to be aggressive defensively but also have poise on the ball is exactly what ETH is looking for. With United chasing Frenkie de Jong and Antony, plus giving Donny van de Beek a second chance at the club, the Ajax vibes will be strong at Old Trafford this season. Do United really need a left-sided defender, though? Luke Shaw and Alex Telles are their current left back options, while Harry Maguire is the left-sided center back. Does this push for Martinez tell us one, or more, of those players is leaving this summer? (JPW)\nPremier League new boys Nottingham Forest have picked up a top quality goalkeeper on loan for the season. Dean Henderson, 25, has joined Forest from Manchester United in a straight loan deal. Henderson previously excelled while on loan at Sheffield United but he hasn’t been able to claim the starting spot ahead of David de Gea since returning to Old Trafford. Henderson had plenty of interest and he will use this move to Forest to try and earn a spot in Gareth Southgate’s 2022 World Cup squad as he will play week in, week out in the Premier League. Steve Cooper and Forest are making some impressive moves this summer as they aim to cement themselves as a top-flight club.

According to reports, Pogba and Juventus have agreed terms, as he inches toward completing the second free transfer from Manchester United to Juventus in his career. Juventus won the Serie A title all four seasons he spent at Juventus, from 2012-2016, plus a pair of Coppa Italia triumphs as well. In six seasons (back) at Man United, Pogba won the Europa League and the League Cup once each. (AE)\nFor the third time in his career, Nemanja Matic has signed to play for Jose Mourinho, this time at Roma, after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer. The 33-year-old signed a one-year contract and will presumably slot straight into defensive midfield for 36 of 38 games next season. (AE)\nManchester United have confirmed that Edinson Cavani, Lee Grant, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba have all left as their contracts have expired. Three academy products will leave as D’Mani Mellor, Reece Devine and Connor Stanley are all now out of contract. Paul McShane will continue his coaching role after retiring from playing, while young goalkeeper Paul Woolston was forced to retire in March through injury but United say ‘he continues to stay in close contact with the club as he begins the next stage of his career.’\nYou can already hear the United fans saying ‘those are the departures… where are the incomings?’ Rome wasn’t build in a day, folks.\nFollow @NicholasMendola\nRed-hot Newcastle host title-chasing Arsenal at St James’ Park on Sunday and it promises to be quite the spectacle.STREAM LIVE NEWCASTLE v ARSENALNewcastle have won eight of their last nine Premier League games to all but secure UEFA Champions League qualification and Eddie Howe saw his side win all three of their games last week, scoring 13 goals in the process.

If he doesn\'t it would put pressure on Tottenham to move him along for a fee in the summer to ensure he does not walk for free in June 2024.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Why Bayern Munich fired their coach\nUnited are in the market for a high-profile striker, as they look to mount a title challenge next season, and have earmarked Kane as an ideal fit. While the report suggests that manager Erik ten Hag is also keen to bring Jude Bellingham to Old Trafford, Kane is the priority.\nAs Bayern still look to find a replacement for Robert Lewandowski, the German club have also been heavily linked with Kane, Spurs\' record goal scorer. However, Spurs\' price tag of over £100m is thought to be too high for the Bavarian club. Lewandowski joined Barcelona last summer. The report states that Eintracht Frankfurt forward Randal Kolo Muani has been identified by Bayern as a cheaper alternative to Kane.\n21.00 BST: Aston Villa are ready to set a new spending record for the club in the summer, according to Football Insider.\nOwners Naseef Sawiris and Wes Edens are said to be ready to spend big on transfer fees, which will bring about a ""huge"" overhaul at the club.\n19.34 BST: Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez could be on his way out, which would make him a summer transfer target for rivals Sevilla, according to Sport.\nThat apparently hinges on whether veteran midfielder Sergio Busquets renews at Camp Nou. If he does, it is thought that Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez will ready to make other midfield changes, including saying goodbye to Gonzalez.\nThe 21-year-old has been unable to break through for Barcelona\'s first team, instead going out on loan with Valencia.\n18.18 BST: Milan are considering the possibility of sending Yacine Adli out on loan this summer, per Calciomercato.\nPer the report, Rossoneri manager Stefano Pioli sees the young midfielder as an attacking-oriented player with a defensive midfielder role not under consideration. As such, that leaves Adli with too much competition ahead of him, and Milan would prefer to see if a loan could help him grow into the player they need.\nMilan spent around €10 million signing him last summer, but Adli has played just 144 minutes since joining the Italian side.\n16.36 BST: Liverpool and Bayern Munich are the favourites to sign Eintracht Frankfurt\'s Daichi Kamada, with Atletico Madrid now out of the running.\nRelevo reports that Atletico need to move players out before they can bring anyone in, and with Kamada a free agent in three months they will not be able to do a quick deal.\nKamada, 26, has won 28 caps for Japan and is an attacking midfielder.\n15.45 BST: Barcelona are monitoring the progress of 18-year-old Fenerbahce midfielder Arda Guler, reports Relevo.\nThe Turkish club will demand a transfer fee of no less than €20m for a player who still has two years remaining on his contract. There is also said to be interest from clubs in the Premier League and the Bundesliga\n14.51 BST: Wilfried Zaha is ready to listen to offers from other Premier League clubs as his contract runs down, reports the Star on Sunday.\nCrystal Palace had been hopeful that the 30-year-old would extend his stay at Selhurst Park, but it now sounds more likely he will move on.\nNewcastle United and West Ham United are reported to be ready to make offers to the forward.\n14.00 BST: Barcelona have sounded out Xavi Simons\' interest in a potential return to Camp Nou, according to several reports in Spain.\nSimons, 19, is having an impressive debut season in the Netherlands with PSV Eindhoven. He has scored 16 goals in 39 appearances across all competitions, setting up eight more.\nAfter coming through Barca\'s La Masia academy, he left the Catalan club for Paris Saint-Germain in 2019, making 11 first team appearances for the French side before moving to PSV last year.\nPSG have an option to re-sign Simons as part of the deal that saw him move to the Eredivisie. There have been reports they could be interested in activating, with Barca also monitoring the youngster\'s situation.\n13.05 BST: The Sunday Mirror reports that Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Brighton, Leicester, West Ham and Brentford sent scouts to watch two Feyenoord players in midweek against Ajax.\nOrkun Kokcu and Santiago Gimenez are both set to be in demand this summer, with interest from across Europe as well as in the Premier League. Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Monaco, Lyon, Wolfsburg and Sevilla also had representatives at the game.\nBenfica are reportedly ready to offer a £31m transfer fee for Turkey international Kokcu, with the midfielder Feyenoord\'s captain at the age of 22.\nGimenez is a 21-year-old Mexico international who could be available for £18m. He has scored 23 goals for Feyenoord this season.\n12.10 BST: Barcelona are preparing a ""revolution"" in the attacking positions this summer in an attempt to provide more support for Robert Lewandowski, according to Diario Sport.\nYannick Carrasco, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Vitor Roque and Abde Ezzalzouli could all be part of Xavi Hernandez\'s first-team squad next season with Ansu Fati, Ferran Torres and Raphinha\'s futures all said to be in doubt.\nLewandowski has netted 17 league goals, while Ansu, Ferran, Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele have managed just 18 between them. While a much-improved defence has meant that hasn\'t cost them in LaLiga, it has seen them come up short in the Champions League, the Europa League and the Copa del Rey. Therefore, Barca are planning to bring in new faces to freshen up their front line.\nAbde could return after an impressive season on loan at Osasuna and the club have already secured a €15m option to sign winger Carrasco from Atletico Madrid.\nThe Catalan side also want to add a striker to take the weight off Lewandowski. Brazilian teenager Roque is their top target, but if his price tag proves too high, they could bring Aubameyang back from Chelsea if he accepts a salary cut.\nThat means, according to Sport, that Barca will listen to offers for Ansu, Ferran and Raphinha to help fund the changes up front.\n11.15 BST: Newcastle United will have to pay Manchester United £50m if they want to sign Scott McTominay this summer, reports the Star on Sunday.\nMcTominay, 26, is considering leaving Man United in search of regular first-team football, and the Magpies are considering an offer.\nThe Scotland international scored the first goal in United\'s 2-0 win over Everton on Saturday, but has played a bit-part role for much of the campaign.\n10.21 BST: Liverpool are hoping to sign Aurelien Tchouameni from Real Madrid, reports El Nacional.\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp must rebuild his midfield this summer and has identified the 23-year-old France international as a key target.\nKlopp wanted to sign Tchouameni last summer, but lost out when he decided to leave AS Monaco for Real Madrid.\nHe has failed to live up to the €80m Madrid paid to sign him, and Los Blancos would be willing to talk to potential suitors.\n09.30 BST: AC Milan are confident that Olivier Giroud will sign a new deal very soon.\nThe 36-year-old has scored 12 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions this season, but is out of contract in the summer.\nAC Milan director Frederic Massara explained that talks have almost been completed, while the club remain hopeful of signing Real Madrid loanee Brahim Diaz on a permanent deal.\n""We are down to the details with Giroud, the renewal is imminent,"" Massara told Sky Sport Italia. ""Brahim Diaz has done very well in recent years. We\'ll sit down at the table with Real Madrid and see what the options are. We would like to bet on him.""\n- U.S. men\'s national team striker Ricardo Pepi is set to leave FC Augsburg in the summer with the forward attracting interest from Dutch duo PSV and Feyenoord, according to Fabrizio Romano. Pepi has impressed on loan at FC Groningen, netting 10 goals in 22 Eredivisie appearances, and looks unlikely to return to Augsburg. Romano reveals the 20-year-old is eager for a new challenge.\n- Paris Saint-Germain are hopeful of securing a new deal for Lionel Messi, despite interest in the forward from Barcelona, reports Sport. It reveals that Kylian Mbappe is keen for Messi to remain at the club, as are the owners -- however, the club are aware that it is becoming increasingly difficult for a deal to be reached. Barcelona have admitted to holding discussions with the Argentina international regarding a potential return.\n- Al Hilal are interested in signing Paris Saint-Germain defender Sergio Ramos, according to Calciomercato. The Spain international is set to leave the French giants at the end of the season, upon the expiration of his contract, The report indicates that Al Hilal are keen to sign an experienced defender in the summer, with the Saudi Arabian outfit working on a deal to acquire the 37-year-old.\n- Manchester United are favourites to sign Bayer Leverkusen right-back Jeremie Frimpong, according to Football Insider. The Netherlands international has been in impressive form this season, registering eight goals and nine assists in all competitions, attracting interest from across Europe in the process. Frimpong is under contract with the Bundesliga outfit until 2025, however, the report suggests that Leverkusen have accepted that the 22-year-old will depart in the summer. While Bayern Munich and Barcelona are thought to be interested, United have made Frimpong their first-choice target for right-back.\n- Liverpool and Chelsea are both interested in Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister, as per Relevo. The Argentina international is set to be one of the most sought-after players in the summer transfer window. Liverpool look set to undergo a midfield overhaul in the summer with James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita all potentially leaving on a free transfer, while Chelsea are eyeing Mac Allister as the perfect partner to compatriot Enzo Fernandez in the middle.'}",Jeremie Frimpong,en

"{'content': ""When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n\nErik ten Hag is keen to bring additional quality to his defence and midfield in the summer window\nManchester United are set to bolster their squad with the summer arrivals of two stars from Germany's top-flight.\nThat is according to outlets Bild and Sky Sports, who each claim a different player will arrive at Old Trafford from the Bundesliga when the summer transfer window opens in June. Sky Sports believe United are keen to make on-loan midfielder Marcel Sabitzer's move permanent, with Bayern reportedly open to allowing the Austrian international to make the full-time switch.\nSabitzer, a former linchpin of the RB Leipzig side previously managed by Julian Nagelsmann, has become a regular at Manchester United since joining on loan in January. The creator's hard-pressing and composure in possession have helped fill the void left by the injured Christian Eriksen.\nRed Devils fans have been impressed with Sabitzer's application since arriving and would likely be pleased to see him join on a long-term deal ahead of next season. Erik ten Hag is said to be a huge admirer of the midfielder's versatility.\nThe other player on United's radar is Bayer Leverkusen's right-back Jeremie Frimpong. The Dutchman has been one of the standout stars of the Bundesliga this campaign, pitching in with eight goals and five assits despite primarily playing as a defender.\nTen Hag has identified right-back as something of a problem position this term. Diogo Dalot has emerged as the Dutchman's first-choice option, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka relegated to back-up duties. However, it is felt that a high-class upgrade will be required if United are to really compete at the upper end of the Premier League table.\nBarcelona are also said to be interested in 22-year-old Frimpong, who is valued at €50 million by Leverkusen.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nEd is a staff writer at FourFourTwo, working across the magazine and website.

Ten Hag has galvanised Manchester United, taking them into the top four and winning the League Cup – while the club are still competing for silverware in the FA Cup and Europa League, too.\nBut the work isn't done just yet with the Dutch manager eyeing more signings this summer – and some big departures as part of his rebuild.\n\nAccording to a report from Spanish outlet\xa0Fichajes (opens in new tab), Ten Hag has identified captain Harry Maguire, his fellow centre-back Victor Lindelof and Donny van de Beek in midfield as three stars that he wants to jettison from Old Trafford.\nMaguire – valued at €25 million by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab) – was accepted as a given to be exiting this summer, with the defender dramatically falling down the pecking order after United's catastrophic 4-0 defeat to Brentford on the second matchday of the season. The other two, however, are a little more surprising.\nUnited have signed high-profile centre-backs in the last two seasons – Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez – but appear to be ready to sign another two this summer, if they want to replace both Maguire and Lindelof directly.\nLindelof hasn't played often this season but was a regular fixture of the Europa League group stage. The Swede is valued to be worth around €15m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab) – Luke Shaw, meanwhile, has played at centre-back, too, this term.\n\nDonny van de Beek has been an even more curious case. Signed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020 when United had Bruno Fernandes ahead of him in the pecking order, van de Beek has never established himself at Old Trafford – even since former boss Ten Hag has come to United.\nThe Dutchman is valued at €17m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).\nManchester United are looking to capitalise on their resurgence in the transfer market, with big new signings.\xa0Victor Osimhen is one option\xa0for €100m,\xa0Declan Rice is on the radar\xa0and\xa0Jeremie Frimpong could arrive as a new right-back.

Bruno Fernandes has been rejuvenated at times under Ten Hag, too, enjoying a return to his best.\nBut with the Manchester United vice-captain coming under fire at times this season for not performing to his full potential in big games, one report has suggested that the Portuguese could be ousted from Old Trafford in Ten Hag's revolution.\n\nOn Monday, David Ornstein (opens in new tab) of The Athletic (opens in new tab) confirmed in his column that United are looking for a No.8 in this midfield, noting that alongside the likes of Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Fred and the on-loan Marcel Sabitzer, Ten Hag has been lacking another top-quality midfielder.\nNow, CaughtOffside (opens in new tab) have speculated that Bruno Fernandes could in fact be the player replaced in the set-up.

"{'content': 'Arthur of América (L) fights for the ball with Pedrinho of Atletico Mineiro (R). Leverkusen ... [+] announced that they had signed Arthur on Monday (Photo by Gledston Tavares/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images)\nBayer Leverkusen has signed wing-back Arthur in a deal worth €7 million ($7.6 million) from Brazilian club América Futebol Club. Leverkusen announced that the 20-year-old had signed a deal until 2028. The transfer is understood to be a precursor to right-back Jeremie Frimpong leaving the club in the summer.\nIn recent weeks, Frimpong has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United. The Dutch right-back has increased his Transfermarkt market value to €35 million ($38.1 million). Leverkusen anticipates a big offer from England that will be significantly above his market value and the €11 million ($12.1 million) Leverkusen paid to Celtic in 2021.\nLeverkusen has indeed signed a player in Arthur that could fill the Frimpong void should he leave the club. It is also not surprising that Leverkusen has gone to South America, Arthur, after all, will become the 24th Brazilian player in the history of Die Werkself.\n""I\'m very proud to soon be able to play for Bayer 04,” Arthur said in a club statement. “The club is well known and popular in Brazil and a lot of my fellow countrymen have become outstanding football players at Leverkusen. I\'m hoping for that too and I will give my all to be successful with the club – in the Bundesliga and also in European competitions.""\nLeverkusen scouted the player heavily and was impressed by what Arthur showed in 23 games across all competitions for América since making his debut in 2022. Leverkusen was not the only one impressed; Arthur was called up by Brazil’s interim manager Ramon Menezes, and he made his debut in the 2-1 defeat to Morocco.\nArthur could be a ready made replacement for Jeremie Frimpong (Photo by Christof Koepsel/Getty ... [+] Images)\nBut what sort of player is Arthur? ""In addition to impressive pace, Arthur primarily has footballing finesse,” Bayer Leverkusen sporting manager director Simon Rolfes said in a club statement. “He is agile, plays with maturity in defense, and is impressive in attack. His signing is a transfer with a long-term perspective, and in Arthur, we have gained a player capable of developing who we believe can play an important role in the medium term.""\nWith Arthur slated to step in eventually to replace Frimpong, the question has to be asked how do the two players compare? Two things stand out, while Frimpong is the better dribbler per 90 minutes (7 vs 5.7), Arthur is the more accurate crosser (52.38% vs 32.56%). Both players compare well when sliding tackles per 90 minutes, interceptions and accurate crosses.\nWhile Frimpong, of course, has achieved his numbers in a top four league, Arthur, however, is still considered a raw talent playing a league significantly below the Bundesliga level. The upside is his age and Leverkusen has a strong history finding talent in Brazil. With all that in mind, there is a good chance Die Werkself has found a ready made replacement for Frimpong, should he be sold next summer.\nManuel Veth is the host of the Bundesliga Gegenpressing Podcast and the Area Manager USA at Transfermarkt.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nKaum ein Durchkommen: Leverkusens Florian Wirtz (links) verzweifelt am Samstag an der Defensive von Union Berlin: ""Die wissen hier jeden Meter richtig einzuschätzen.""\nNach dem leistungsgerechten 0:0 lobt Berlins Trainer Urs Fischer den Auftritt gegen die ""formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga"" und wirkt trotz der Siege der Rivalen nicht besorgt um einen Platz in einem europäischen Wettbewerb.\nVon Javier Cáceres, Berlin\nIn einem Spiel, das ein einziger Gesang an die Konzentration zweier defensiv fehlerloser Mannschaften war, haben Union Berlin und Bayer Leverkusen einander wichtige Punkte für den Saisonschlussspurt abgenommen. Am fünftletzten Spieltag der Bundesliga trennten sich die beiden stabilsten Teams des laufenden Kalenderjahres in einem ""tollen, intensiven Nullzunullspiel"", wie Unions Trainer Urs Fischer sagte, überaus leistungsgerecht\xa0torlos.\nUnion bleibt zwar Tabellendritter, spürt nun aber im Nacken den Atem der Verfolger: Freiburg ist nach dem 1:0-Sieg in Köln punktgleicher Vierter und steht wegen des schlechteren Torverhältnisses hinter den Berlinern; Leipzig ist durch den Sieg gegen Hoffenheim (ebenfalls 1:0) als Fünfter auf zwei Punkte herangekommen. Leverkusen wiederum ist acht Punkte hinter dem Champions-League-Platz vier. Trainer Xabi Alonso denkt nicht daran, das Ziel aufzugeben, das maximal Mögliche anzustreben. ""Wir müssen realistisch sein. Aber wir waren vor zwei oder vier Monaten in einer weit schlechteren Ausgangslage"", erklärte der Spanier, der die Leverkusener übernahm, als sie ein Abstiegskandidat\xa0waren.\nDer umstrittene, weil angeblich kremlnahe Oligarch Alischer Usmanow outet sich als großer Fan des FC Bayern. Zuvor waren Räume des Rekordmeisters und in der Allianz-Arena durchsucht worden - weil Usmanow dort mittels einer Loge Geld gewaschen haben soll.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Jörg Schmitt und Ralf Wiegand\nAlonso, der als Aktiver niemals nach Köpenick reisen musste und die Visite im engen, Tradition verströmenden Stadion nach eigenem Bekunden genoss, konnte überdies darauf verweisen, dass eine wichtige Serie hielt. Leverkusen ist seit nunmehr 14 Spielen ungeschlagen, und darauf war Alonso schon stolz. Die Unioner hatten ihm vorab Respekt abgerungen, nach dem Spiel sah er sich darin bestätigt: ""Heute haben wir (am eigenen Leib) gespürt, warum Union in dieser Saison zuhause ungeschlagen ist"", sagte\xa0er.\nGenau genommen hat Union in der Bundesliga im eigenen Stadion seit Februar 2022 nicht mehr verloren, damals gewann Borussia Dortmund 3:0. Und hätte Union Saint-Gilloise nicht in der Europa League einmal in der Alten Försterei gewonnen, so wäre der Nimbus der Unbezwingbarkeit der Unioner in dieser Spielzeit absolut. Alonso zitierte auch deshalb das Bonmot des Niederländers Johan Cruyff, der wie Alonso mit der Rückennummer 14 berühmt wurde: ""Wenn du nicht gewinnen kannst, musst du wenigstens sicher gehen, dass du nicht\xa0verlierst.""\nEr selbst tat in der Anfangsphase einiges dafür, dass dies gelang. Umständehalber hatte er den nominellen Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba fachfremd auf die Doppelsechs geschoben, und Alonso assistierte ihm durch intensives Coachen so sehr, dass er den halblangen Wintermantel schon nach wenigen Minuten wieder auszog: Fürs Winken war er zu warm und\xa0unbequem.\nErforderlich wurden seine Interventionen, weil die Unioner die Partie entzündeten, kaum, dass sie begonnen hatte. Nach fünf Minuten hielt Sheraldo Becker aus 20 Metern drauf, Lukas Hradecky hatte keine größeren Mühen. Hernach war 04-Verteidiger Kouakou Kossonou zwei Mal in größerer Not zur Stelle: Erst vereitelte er eine Chance Beckers (8. Minute), dann war er gegen Jordan Siebatcheu in extremis parat (10.). Nach und nach fruchteten die Justierungen Alonsos, übernahm Leverkusen eine größere Kontrolle über die Partie. Und das fand Ausdruck in einem Blitzkonter, bei dem Florian Wirtz den Ball auf Moussa Diaby ablegte. Doch der Franzose verfehlte das\xa0Ziel.\nDer Rest der Partie war bei größerem Ballbesitz der Leverkusener vor allem von Taktik geprägt - und der zähen Verteidigungshaltung der Unioner. Die Leverkusener versuchten zwar unentwegt, sich den Gegner zurechtzulegen: Immer wieder verlagerten sie das Spiel. Doch das geriet ein ums andere Mal steril. ""Es ist einfach schwer hier, sich in diesem Stadion durchzukombinieren. Die wissen hier jeden Meter richtig einzuschätzen"", klagte der deutsche Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz, der immer wieder versuchte, durch individuelle Kreativität ein Loch in das defensive Sieb der Köpenicker zu reißen - ohne durchschlagenden\xa0Erfolg.\n""Wir haben gegen die aus meiner Sicht formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten mitgehalten und mitgespielt"", sagte Union-Trainer Urs Fischer (rechts, mit Xabi Alonso).\nDie zweite Halbzeit gebar dann zunächst ein Übergewicht der Unioner. Mittelfeldspieler Aïssa Laïdouni sah sich unvermittelt an der Strafraumgrenze in guter, mittiger Schussposition, doch er verfehlte den Giebel knapp (48.). Becker war dann ein ähnliches Schicksal beschieden, als er sich mit einem Schlenzer aus halblinker Position versuchte. Ansonsten hielt sich die Zahl hochkarätiger Chancen in Grenzen. Nicht, weil die beiden Mannschaften passiv auf den Fehler des Gegners gewartet hätten, in Sachen Initiative waren beide Teams ebenbürtig. Aber: Beide verhielten sich defensiv ähnlich tadellos. Ein einziges Mal nur musste sich Unions Torwart Frederik Rönnow auszeichnen: Bei einem wuchtigen Kopfstoß von Leverkusens Verteidiger Bakker auf Flanke von Jeremie Frimpong (86.) in der Schlussphase, die den Gästen\xa0gehörte.\nWas aus diesem Punkt folgt? Die Resultate der Rivalen im Kampf um einen Platz in einem europäischen Wettbewerb nahmen die Unioner bestenfalls zur Kenntnis. ""Wir schauen auf uns"", sagte Stürmer Sheraldo Becker. Trainer Urs Fischer freute sich darüber, dass sein Team das Umschaltspiel der Leverkusener neutralisieren konnte. Der Gegner habe ""kaum Geschwindigkeit aufnehmen können"", lobte\xa0er.\n""Wir haben gegen die aus meiner Sicht formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten mitgehalten und mitgespielt"", sagte Fischer, und es war ihm anzumerken, dass das für ihn ein Wert an sich war. Alles andere ist Zubrot: Inklusive der Ausbeute von 56 Zählern, die wohl dazu führen wird, dass Union einen neuen, klubeigenen Punkterekord aufstellen wird. Es fehlen dazu - bei vier verbleibenden Spielen - nur noch zwei\xa0Punkte.\nNach dem 1:1 in Bochum richtet sich die Wut des BVB in Richtung Schiedsrichter Stegemann, weil er nach einem Einsteigen gegen Karim Adeyemi keinen Elfmeter pfiff.

"{'content': 'Der 1. FC Union hat im Spitzenspiel die besseren Chancen, kann jedoch keinen weiteren großen Schritt Richtung Champions League machen.\n29.04.2023, 17:32\xa0Uhr | Update: 29.04.2023, 18:32\xa0Uhr\nDie Ecke hatte Jeremie Frimpong hereingeschlagen, den Kopfball brachte Mitchel Bakker aufs Tor. Dieser stellte für Frederik Rönnow, den Torwart des 1. FC Union, jedoch keine große Herausforderung dar. Bemerkenswert war die Szene trotzdem: Es war das erste Mal im Spiel gegen Bayer Leverkusen, dass Rönnow richtig eingreifen musste. In der 86. Minute.\nDa Union ebenfalls nicht sonderlich viele Gelegenheiten gehabt hatte, gab es bis dahin keine Tore. Und auch danach nicht. „Für mich war es ein intensives, tolles 0:0-Spiel“, sagte Unions Trainer Urs Fischer: „Wir haben gegen die derzeit formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten gut mitgehalten und mitgespielt.“\nUnion war nach vorn die aktivere Mannschaft und hatte die besseren Chancen. Trotzdem überwog am Ende die Zufriedenheit über den geholten Punkt: „Gegen eine solch offensivstarke Mannschaft ohne Gegentor zu bleiben, ist schon eine Auszeichnung“, sagte Verteidiger Robin Knoche.\nWer weiß, wofür dieses Unentschieden noch gut ist, wenn die Saison in vier Wochen endet. „In der Endabrechnung kann dir vielleicht jeder Punkt helfen“, sagte Fischer. Erst einmal ist der Vorsprung des Tabellendritten in Sachen Champions-League-Ränge allerdings geschmolzen, da die Verfolger SC Freiburg und RB Leipzig jeweils 1:0 beim 1. FC Köln beziehungsweise gegen die TSG Hoffenheim gewannen. Doch zumindest hält Union den Sechsten Bayer weiter acht Punkte auf Distanz.\nBeide Serien hielten am Sonnabend im ausverkauften Stadion An der Alten Försterei vor 22.012 Fans: Union bleibt weiter seit Mitte Februar 2022 in der Fußball-Bundesliga zu Hause ungeschlagen. Leverkusen ist nun wettbewerbsübergreifend 14 Pflichtspiele nacheinander ohne Niederlage.\nIm Vergleich zum komplett überzeugenden Auftritt zuletzt bei Borussia Mönchengladbach veränderte Trainer Fischer sein Team nur auf einer Position. Für den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens spielte Jordan Siebatcheu von Beginn an. Bei den Gästen war neben Edmond Tapsoba nach überstandenem Magen-Darm-Infekt auch wieder Florian Wirtz dabei.\nUnion: Rönnow - Doekhi, Knoche, Leite - Laidouni (69. Schäfer), Haberer (78. Thorsby) - Juranovic, Khedira, Roussillon (90. Gießelmann) - Siebatcheu (78. S. Michel), S. BeckerLeverkusen: Hradecky - Kossounou, Tah, Hincapié - Frimpong, Andrich, Tapsoba, Bakker - Hlozek (62. Azmoun), Diaby (62. Adli), Wirtz.Schiedsrichter: Fritz.Zuschauer: 22.012 (ausverkauft)\nWirtz war es auch, der die erste vielversprechende Vorwärtsbewegung der Gäste einleitete. Nach seinem Zuspiel in der 17. Minute verzog Moussa Diaby. Bis dahin hatte nur Union gespielt und in einer stürmischen Anfangsphase mehrere gute Gelegenheiten gehabt. Doch Bayers Abwehrspieler Odilon Kossounou klärte zweimal in letzter Sekunde und ein Kopfball von Jordan fand nicht sein Ziel.\nAb Mitte der ersten Hälfte verlor die Begegnung deutlich an Tempo. Union stand hinten sehr sicher. Bayer kam nach vorn weiterhin so gut wie gar nicht zum Zuge, sorgte nur bei Kontern mitunter für Gefahr. Bei der besten Chance traf Diaby nach Zuspiel von Mitchel Bakker den Ball nicht richtig. Kurz vor der Pause rutschte Frimpong in aussichtsreicher Position beim Versuch weg, den Ball anzunehmen.\nWie die erste begann auch die zweite Hälfte recht flott. Diesmal mit, allerdings eher Halbchancen auf beiden Seiten. Ab der 60. Minute waren die Gastgeber erneut die zielstrebigere Mannschaft, kamen meist über die linke Seite. Am nächsten dran am Führungstreffer war Becker, dessen Schlenzer am rechten Pfosten vorbei flog. Danach tat sich in der Nähe beider Tore wieder äußerst wenig.\nErst in der Schlussphase drehte Bayer etwas auf, außer beim Kopfball von Bakker musste Torwart Rönnow aber nicht eingreifen. So fand nicht nur Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso: „Das Unentschieden ist ein faires Ergebnis.“\n\nZur Startseite\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Gegen Bayer Leverkusen sucht Union-Trainer Fischer nach dem richtigen Mittel, die imposante Heimserie aufrechtzuerhalten.\nBerlin.\xa0Fußball-Bundesligist 1. FC Union Berlin ist vor dem kommenden Heimspiel auf der Suche nach der richtigen Balance. „Schauen wir mal, ob es ein Geduldspiel wird. Ich glaube schon“, sagte Union-Trainer Urs Fischer am Donnerstag vor der samstäglichen Begegnung des 30. Spieltags gegen Bayer Leverkusen im Stadion An der Alten Försterei (15.30 Uhr/Sky). Neben der Geduld blickt der 57-Jährige vor allem auf die schnellen Spieler in den Reihen der Rheinländer, die beim 5:0 im Hinspiel den Berlinern die bisher höchste Saisonniederlage zugefügt hatten: „Da kommt eine enorme Geschwindigkeit auf uns zu.“\nDabei schaut der Schweizer nicht nur auf Moussa Diaby, der bereits fünf Tore in den bisherigen sieben Bundesligaduellen gegen Union bejubeln durfte. Auch Jeremie Frimpong oder Amine Adli gehören zu den schnellsten Spielern in der Bundesliga. „Es braucht kurze Abstände und jeder muss bereit sein, den anderen zu unterstützen. Bist du da nicht drauf, hat Leverkusen eine zu hohe Geschwindigkeit. Dann wird es schwierig zu verteidigen“, sagte Fischer, der das Team des Spaniers Xabi Alonso als derzeit „formstärkste Mannschaft“ adelte, die seit 13 Pflichtspielen nicht mehr verloren hat.\nAngesichts der Tabellenkonstellation des seit 20 Heimspielen ungeschlagenen Tabellendritten gegen den sechstplatzierten Gast aus Leverkusen könnten die Gäste mehr Spielanteile für sich behaupten, was der Spielweise der Unioner zugutekäme und die Frage nach der Geduld beantwortet. Wobei Fischer Geduld nicht mit Abwarten verwechseln möchte. „Wenn wir abwartend beginnen zu spielen, das hat uns das noch nie geholfen. Die zweite Hälfte gegen Bochum war zu viel abwartend“, sagt der Trainer rückblickend auf vorherige Heimspiel beim 1:1 gegen den Abstiegskandidaten, „wir tun gut daran, von der ersten Minute an aktiv zu sein. Am Schluss haben wir ein Heimspiel, das wir gewinnen wollen.“'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Bevor es die Fußballer von Bayer Leverkusen im Europa-League-Halbfinale demnächst mit AS Rom zu tun bekommen im Kampf ums Finale und um ein goldenes Ticket für die Champions League, müssen sie in der Bundesliga erst noch alles dafür tun, den Kontakt zu den Top-Vier herzustellen.

Auch sie haben zwar noch einen Zweitwettbewerb in petto - sie spielen am 2. Mai ein DFB-Pokal-Halbfinale beim SC Freiburg -, allerdings geht es im Pokal nicht um eine Karte für die Champions League, nur für die Europa League. Das wäre den Leipzigern zu wenig. Umso bedeutsamer sind die nächsten Spiele in der Bundesliga. Am Samstag empfangen sie die TSG\xa0Hoffenheim.\nDie Leverkusener, mit zwölf Pflichtspielen ohne Niederlage als derzeit formstärkstes Team der Liga in dieses Duell gegangen, mussten auf ihren wichtigsten Mittelfeldspieler Florian Wirtz verzichten. Der 19-Jährige saß mit Magen-Darm-Verstimmung immerhin auf der Tribüne, sah von dort aber zunächst eine aktivere Leipziger Mannschaft. Deren Trainer Marco Rose hatte kurz vor dem Spiel bei Dazn verraten, dass man ""Chancen im Rücken von Jeremie Frimpong"" suchen werde. Frimpong ist Bayers supertorgefährlicher Rechtsaußenstürmerverteidiger, der vom niederländischen Nationaltrainer Ronald Koeman wegen Defensivschwächen aber ignoriert wird. Koeman sieht in ihm irgendwie gar keinen\xa0Abwehrmann.\nDie Leipziger fanden trotz weitgehender Überlegenheit keine Chancen im Rücken von Frimpong. Stattdessen platzierte Leverkusens Piero Hincapié nach 30 Minuten einen trockenen 30-Meter-Lattenschuss als Warnung, ehe Adam Hlozek in der 40. Minute die 1:0-Führung für die Gastgeber erzielte. Der Angriff war über rechts erfolgt, über die Seite von Frimpong und Moussa Diaby, der auch die Vorlage zum Treffer gab. Im Rücken von Frimpong jubelten die Leverkusener\xa0Abwehrspieler.\nBei Leipzig kam nach der Pause Christopher Nkunku für Kevin Kampl. Das sächsische Spiel benötigte im rheinischen Dauerregen mehr Vertikalität. Dies erschwerten ihnen die Leverkusener allerdings dadurch, dass sie sich sehr weit zurückzogen. So gingen die Leipziger Bälle horizontal von links nach rechts und zurück. Chancen ergaben sich trotzdem, etwa durch Standards, das Eckenverhältnis lautete am Ende 9:0 für Leipzig. Allein, ein Tor blieb ihnen\xa0versagt.\nAusgerechnet Frimpong, mit breiter Brust statt anfälligem Rücken, entschied die Partie fünf Minuten vor Schluss für Leverkusen. Seinen Konter beendete Leipzigs Dominik Szoboszlai im Strafraum per Foul, was ihm die gelb-rote Karte einbrachte und Bayer einen Elfmeter, den Nadiem Amiri in der 86. Minute zum 2:0 einschoss.

Gute Gründe für ein paar Überlegungen in diese Richtung hat er angesichts der Entwicklungen im Meisterkampf aber zweifellos gehabt, und dass der Trainer von RB Leipzig am Sonntag ziemlich viel über Fußball nachdachte, war nicht zu übersehen, während der 0:2-Niederlage bei Bayer Leverkusen.\nImmer wieder stand Rose in Denkerpose in seiner Coachingzone, kraulte seinen Bart und fand doch keine Lösung gegen das Team seines derzeit erfolgreichen Kollegen Xabi Alonso, der noch auf den Gewinn der Europa League hoffen kann. Mit einer ebenso schlauen wie pragmatischen Spielweise haben die Leverkusener durch Tore von Adam Hlozek und Nadiem Amiri Leipzig besiegt.\nGut 25 Minuten war praktisch nichts passiert in dieser Partie, die als eine Art Spitzenspiel um die Teilnahme an der kommenden Champions-League-Saison betrachtet werden konnte.\xa0Leverkusen\xa0wirkte matt. Und Leipzig ist in diesem Frühjahr einfach unzuverlässig, schwer berechenbar und ineffizient.\nDas Spiel floss in etlichen Phasen ruhig vor sich hin. Bis die etwas intensivere Schlussphase begann, passierte abgesehen von einzelnen Momenten nicht sehr viel. Früh im Spiel vergeudete die Werkself eine tolle Vier-gegen-Einen-Konterchance, weil Mitchell Bakker ins Abseits gelaufen war, und vor dem Leverkusener Tor kam Dominik Szoboszlai zu einem Torabschluss aus guter Position, schoss jedoch nicht platziert genug (30.). Unter der Abwesenheit von Florian Wirtz litt scheinbar nicht nur die Werkself, sondern das gesamte Spielniveau.\nDer Nationalspieler saß aufgrund eines Magen-Darm-Infektes auf der Tribüne, von wo er dann nach 40 Minuten die Führung für sein Team bejubeln konnte. Robert Andrich hatte einen exzellenten Pass in die Tiefe auf Moussa Diaby gespielt, der den Ball in den Rücken der Abwehr weiterleitete, von wo Hlozek aus elf Metern zum 1:0 traf. Das war eine verdiente Führung in einer Partie, in die Leipzig eine Stunde lang viel zu wenig investierte, angesichts der Ausgangslage.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nAlle Infos und Themen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF.A.Z.-Sonderseite zu Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlle Teams im Überblick\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie aktuelle Tabelle der Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlles in der Übersicht\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpielplan der Bundesliga: Termine, Ergebnisse, Partien\nAm Nachmittag hatte Freiburg die Sachsen in der Tabelle überholt, womit RB aus den Champions-League-Plätzen herausgerutscht war.

Minute Leverkusens Torhüter Lukas Hradecky zunächst gegen Timo Werner rettete und anschließend einen gefährlichen Kopfball von Willi Orban hielt. Das war nicht gefährlich genug, und die Leverkusener Gegenangriffe stoppten die Leipziger immer wieder mit Fouls.

Pflichtspiel ohne Niederlage als Sechster bis auf vier Zähler an die Sachsen heran. Drei Tage nach dem Halbfinal-Einzug in der Europa League nahm Bayer in der Fußball-Bundesliga Tuchfühlung zu den Champions-League-Plätzen auf.\n""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr, sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft"", sagte Bayers starker Innenverteidiger Jonathan Tah im Streamingdienst DAZN und lobte die Kollegen: ""Wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt."" Tah kündigte für den Saison-Endspurt an: ""Wir machen weiter, wir sind nicht zufrieden."" RB-Trainer Marco Rose ärgerte sich dagegen: ""Das war das x-te Spiel diese Saison, was wir einfach nicht verlieren dürfen.""\nDer bisherige Tabellen-Vierte Leipzig rutschte durch die schon achte Saison-Niederlage aus den Champions-League-Rängen und belegt nun direkt vor Bayer Platz fünf. Adam Hlozek (40. Minute) und Nadiem Amiri per Foulelfmeter (86.) erzielten Leverkusens Tore. Die Sachsen belohnten sich für ihre klare Überlegenheit in der zweiten Halbzeit nicht und verloren Dominik Szoboszlai vor dem Elfmeter durch eine Gelb-Rote Karte.\nLeipzig zielstrebig, aber ""nicht konsequent genug""\n""In den entscheidenden Momenten waren wir nicht konsequent genug, sowohl offensiv als auch defensiv"", sagte RB-Profi Benjamin Henrichs und sprach von einem Rückschlag. ""Das ist so ein Muster, was uns Punkte kostet. Wir sind nicht effektiv genug.""\nBei Bayer standen gleich drei der wichtigsten Leistungsträger der vergangenen Wochen gar nicht im Kader. Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz fehlte nach Vereinsangaben wegen Magen-Darm-Problemen und saß mit blau-weißer Basecap auf der Tribüne. Abwehrspieler Edmond Tapsoba wurde wegen muskulärer Probleme als Vorsichtsmaßnahme geschont, der argentinische Weltmeister Exquiel Palacios wurde nicht rechtzeitig fit.\nDie Leipziger, denen Nationalspieler David Raum wegen einer Gelbsperre fehlte, waren zunächst die frischere und aktivere Mannschaft. Timo Werner hatte in der sechsten Minute aus spitzem Winkel schon die Führung auf dem Fuß, schoss Bayer-Keeper Lukas Hradecky aber gegen den Brustkorb.\nDie Leverkusener, die in den vergangenen Wochen ihr Offensivspiel mehr aus einer kompakten Defensive aufzogen, standen diesmal noch tiefer. Doch dann bekamen sie plötzlich die Konterchance schlechthin, als Mitchel Bakker, Kerem Demirbay und Moussa Diaby nach einem Leipziger Eckball zu dritt gegen einen aufs Tor zuliefen und den Ball vertändelten (28.). Piero Hincapiés Fernschuss aus 30 Metern unterschätzte Torwart Janis Blaswich, sodass der Ball gegen die Latte klatschte (32.).\nLeverkusen lauert und entscheidet spät\nLeipzig hatte im ersten Durchgang über 60 Prozent Ballbesitz und nominell deutlich mehr Torschüsse. Doch die besseren Chancen hatte Leverkusen und die vierte nutzten die Rheinländer dann, als Hlozek eine scharfe Hereingabe von Diaby aus zehn Metern zu seinem fünften Saisontor einschob.\nLeipzigs Trainer Marco Rose brachte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku. Deutschlands Fußballer des Jahres hatte nach einem Außenbandriss in der Vorwoche ein 16-minütiges Comeback gegeben. Leipzigs Spiel wurde zwar nur etwas zielstrebiger, doch nun gab es wenigstens Chancen. Vor allem eben durch Nkunku, dem Tah nach einer Parade von Hradecky den Ball in letzter Sekunde vor den Füßen wegschlug (66.). Kurz darauf parierte Hradecky den Kopfball von Willi Orban nach einem Eckball (68.). Frimpong verpasste bei einem Leverkusener Konter noch die Entscheidung (83.), für die dann Amiri vom Elfmeterpunkt sorgte.

"{'content': 'Timo Werner und seine Leipziger kassierten in Leverkusen einen Rückschlag im Kampf um einen Platz in der Champions League.\n(Foto: IMAGO/Nordphoto)\nIm Europacup ist Bayer Leverkusen der einzige Bundesligist im Halbfinale. Und in der Liga rollt die Werkself weiter das Feld von hinten auf. Leipzig rutscht derweil aus den Champions-League-Rängen. Pechvogel bei den anrennenden Gästen ist DFB-Stürmer Timo Werner.\nHöhenflug in Europa, Aufholjagd in der Liga: Die Titeljäger von Bayer Leverkusen haben ihren beeindruckenden Lauf auch gegen RB Leipzig fortgesetzt. Drei Tage nach dem Sprung ins Europa-League-Halbfinale schlug die gnadenlos effektive Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso den DFB-Pokalsieger 2:0 (1:0) und nahm vorsichtig die Champions-League-Plätze ins Visier. ""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft. Wir haben wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt"", sagte Jonathan Tah bei DAZN: ""Wir machen immer weiter und sind nicht zufrieden.""\nAdam Hlozek (40.) und Nadiem Amiri (86., Foulelfmeter) erzielten vor 29.085 Zuschauern die Tore für die Leverkusener, die auch ohne Florian Wirtz im achten Ligaspiel in Folge ungeschlagen blieben. Die Leipziger, die im siebten Auswärtsspiel erstmals bei Bayer verloren und das Spiel nach einer Gelb-Roten Karte gegen Dominik Szoboszlai (85.) zu zehnt beendeten, sind nur noch vier Punkte entfernt und rutschten nach dem 29. Spieltag aus den Königsklassen-Plätzen. Bayer lauert unmittelbar dahinter als Sechster. ""Wir haben nicht schlecht gespielt, aber das bringt uns nichts - wir haben es nicht konsequent genug zu Ende gespielt"", sagte Leipzigs Benjamin Henrichs. Diese fehlende Konsequenz ""kostet uns Punkte"".\nNach dem Einzug ins erste Europapokal-Halbfinale seit 21 Jahren am Donnerstag wechselte Alonso dreimal - zweimal davon zwangsweise: Der formstarke Wirtz fehlte am späten Sonntagnachmittag wegen Magen-Darm-Beschwerden ebenso wie Edmond Tapsoba, der aufgrund von muskulären Problemen aussetzen musste.\nGegen Angstgegner Leipzig, der vor dem Duell nur zwei von 13 Pflichtspielen gegen die Rheinländer verloren hatte, agierten die Leverkusener anfangs deutlich passiver als noch unter der Woche bei Union Saint-Gilloise (4:1). Die Anfangsphase gehörte den Gästen: Timo Werner, Doppelpacker beim 3:2 gegen den FC Augsburg, testete Bayer-Torwart Lukas Hradecky erstmals (6.).\nLeverkusen streute immer wieder ungewohnte Fehlpässe und technische Fehler im Spielaufbau ein. Leipzig konnte die Ballgewinne aber zunächst nicht in gezielte Angriffe ummünzen. Das Spiel verflachte in der Folge: Bayer überließ RB meist den Ball und lauerte auf Konter - spielte die wenigen Umschaltaktionen aber anfangs zu ungenau aus. Aus dem Nichts sorgte Piero Hincapie (32.) mit einem Lattentreffer aus rund 30 Metern für die beste Bayer-Szene bis dahin, Leverkusen war nun aktiver und belohnte sich: Hlozek vollendete einen Konter nach einer scharfen Hereingabe von Moussa Diaby technisch stark mit links.\nDie Führung kam zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend und bescherte Bayer gleichwohl Sicherheit. Leipzig, mit drei Pflichtspielsiegen in Folge ins Rheinland gereist, schien beeindruckt. Wirtz verfolgte auf der Tribüne bei starkem Regen, wie Bayer die Führung mit zunehmender Spieldauer nur noch verwaltete. Rose hatte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku, der nach seinem Muskelfaserriss das zweite Spiel bestritt, für Kevin Kampl gebracht und damit offensiv gewechselt.\nNkunku (62.) leitete mit seinem Abschluss die beste Leipziger Phase ein. Die müde wirkenden Leverkusener beschränkten sich nur noch aufs Verteidigen und gingen damit ins Risiko. Werner (66.) vergab eine Riesenchance gegen Hradecky. RB rannte weiter an - war dabei aber anfällig für Konter. Die Sachsen belohnten sich für ihre klare Überlegenheit. Szoboszlai brachte bei einem solchen Leverkusener Angriff Jeremie Frimpong zu Fall und musste vom Feld. Amiri verwandelte vom Elfmeterpunkt.\nQuelle: ntv.de, tno/sid'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nXabi Alonso macht Leverkusen besser - und lernt zugleich als Trainernovize viel dazu.\nLeverkusen erreicht erstmals seit 21 Jahren ein Europapokal-Halbfinale. Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso - auch, weil er erfolgreich gegen Leverkusener Sitten ansteuert.\nVon Philipp Selldorf, Leverkusen\nNach dem Coup im Lotto-Stadion in Anderlecht wurde im inneren Zirkel Bayer Leverkusens vor allem über die angemessene Zuteilung von Siegerbieren diskutiert. Der Torwart Lukas Hradecky nahm seine Kapitänspflichten gewissenhaft wahr und eröffnete die Debatte. Üblicherweise informiert er nach gewonnenen Spielen in eigener Sache, er werde sich abends ""ein, zwei Bierchen"" gönnen, diesmal aber ging er als Teamsprecher im Stil eines Lokomotivführer-Gewerkschafters in die Tarifverhandlungen: ""Ich glaube, fünf Bier sind erlaubt"", sagte er mit Blick auf die dreistündige Busreise ins Rheinland. Simon Rolfes, der Vertreter der Arbeitgeberseite, deutete Entgegenkommen an (""das eine oder andere geht schon""), wies aber auch auf gebotene Grenzen hin: ""Das Fußballer-Leben ist\xa0hart.""\nRB Leipzig, am Sonntag der nächste Bundesliga-Gegner, darf sich womöglich freuen: Euphorisierte Leverkusener Profifußballer sind traditionell gern bereit, beim nächsten Pflichttermin etwas weniger diensteifrig aufzutreten. Bei dieser Mannschaft und diesem Trainer weiß man allerdings nicht, ob überlieferte Sitten noch gelten. Zwar erzählt man sich am Rhein, Disziplin sei nicht die hervorragende Eigenschaft des aktuellen Bayer-Kaders, zugleich versichern die Bayer-Verantwortlichen jedoch, Trainer Xabi Alonso sei ein Mann, dem Disziplin und hausinterne Regeltreue viel bedeuteten. Es sieht so aus, als ob er sich damit durchsetzen\xa0würde.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Interview von Javier Cáceres\nBeim Europacup-Rückspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise obsiegte eindeutig die Linie des spanischen Trainers. Leverkusens 4:1-Sieg drückte nicht nur eine konzentrierte Leistung aus, er sah auch nach dem Triumph einer Mannschaft aus, die mit einer klaren Strategie ins Spiel gegangen war. Als Alonso nach dem 1:1 gegen eine abgezockte Union-Elf im Hinspiel vor einer Woche in aller Gelassenheit betonte, Bayer sei ""bereit"" und ""gut vorbereitet"" für die zweite Folge, klang das verdächtig vielsagend. Nun führte die Mannschaft vor, dass der Trainer für die beiden Viertelfinal-Spiele einen kombinierten Plan entworfen\xa0hatte.\nDass sein Team schon nach 67 Sekunden unter glücklichen Umständen in Führung gehen würde - Torschütze Moussa Diaby erhielt die Vorlage von Gegnerseite -, konnte zwar selbst der Fußballweise Alonso nicht voraussehen. Doch schon in der ersten Minute wurde die Leverkusener Spielanlage sichtbar, die von offensiven Rollenwechseln und einem stabilen defensiven Fundament geprägt war. Diaby, Florian Wirtz, Adam Hlozek und Jeremie Frimpong teilten sich die Räume nach Bedarf und Belieben. Auf der linken Seite marschierte derweil Mitchel Bakker auf und nieder, dass Hradecky an ein anatomisches Wunder glaubte: ""Ich weiß nicht, wie viele Lungen der Mann hat, wahrscheinlich mehr als\xa0zwei.""\nDem niederländischen Linksverteidiger Bakker, 22, wird nachgesagt, er verstehe es, innerhalb von zwei Szenen eines Fußballspiels sowohl Welt- als auch Kreisklasse zu verkörpern. Ferner ist er berüchtigt für häufiges Zuspätkommen, was ihn außer einigen Euro auch Einsätze bei Punktspielen gekostet hat. Zuletzt ist aber eine gewisse Regelmäßigkeit in seinen Arbeitszeiten eingekehrt, was auch für Bakkers Auftreten im Spiel gilt. Wild ist es hin und wieder immer noch, aber nicht mehr wüst wie früher. Beim Treffer zum 2:0 (37.) blieb Bakker cool und vollendete damit einen meisterlich ausgespielten Gegenangriff über Wirtz, Diaby und Flankengeber Hlozek. Am 3:0 (60.) hatte er seinen Anteil, als er dem zögerlichen Union-Torwart Anthony Moris so sehr zusetzte, dass dieser den Ball für Frimpong geradewegs zum Einschuss\xa0bereitlegte.\n21 Jahre sind vergangen, seit Bayer 04 das letzte Mal im Halbfinale eines Eurocups gestanden hat, es war die Saison, in der sich das Team um Ballack, Lucio, Bastürk und Berbatov als dreimaliger Vize unselig verewigte: in der Meisterschaft, im Pokal und in der Champions League. Kurioserweise hieß es vor dieser Saison, der aktuelle Bayer-Kader sei dank hochkarätiger Besetzung am ehesten geeignet, mit dem Ensemble von damals zu konkurrieren. Unselig geriet aber auch dessen Mission zunächst, und die ersten Amtshandlungen des im Herbst anstelle von Gerardo Seoane eingesetzten Trainers Alonso wollten ebenfalls nicht gleich\xa0glücken.\nInzwischen jedoch hat er Spieler wie Bakker neu erfunden, andere Spieler wiederentdeckt, die schon unauffindbar im Kader verloren gegangen waren (Exequiel Palacios, Nadiem Amiri), und wieder andere Spieler auf selten erreichtes Niveau getrimmt (Verteidiger Jonathan Tah). Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso. Leverkusens ""semifinalwürdige Leistung"" (Hradecky) in Brüssel wird weiter dazu\xa0beitragen.\nGerüchte darüber, dass ihn Real Madrids Patron Florentino Pérez als Nachfolger für Carlo Ancelotti herbeiwünscht - womöglich schon im Sommer -, sind auch den Bayer-Oberen bekannt und werden von ihnen nicht für unglaubwürdig gehalten. Sie verweisen jedoch gelassen auf seine Vertragsdauer (bis 2024) und auf Alonsos Klugheit. Als Trainer-Neuling hat er in Leverkusen schon viel gelernt, aber er wird noch viel mehr dazulernen können. Das Treffen mit der AS Rom im Halbfinale bietet dazu die beste Gelegenheit, dann bekommt er es mit dem alten Meistermacher José Mourinho zu\xa0tun.\nDer spektakuläre Trainerwechsel hat bei den Bayern die Saison nicht gerettet und bereits jetzt Thomas Tuchel beschädigt. Dennoch fehlt die Fantasie, dass jemand dafür Verantwortung übernehmen muss - wenn doch, würde es spannend.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Seitdem Xabi Alonso Bayer 04 Anfang Oktober auf dem 17. Tabellenplatz übernommen hat, hat der Spanier die Mannschaft in einem schmerzhaften und nicht an Rückschlägen armen Umerziehungsprozess von einem wilden Haufen hochbegabter, aber genauso taktisch undisziplinierter Künstler zu einem Kollektiv geformt, das immer mehr die Konturen einer echten Spitzenmannschaft annimmt.\n""Es sind nur sechs, sieben Monate, aber es ist viel passiert. Am Anfang war es nicht einfach, aber es ist immer eine Entwicklung. Wir sind zufrieden, dass wir diese Stimmung verändern konnten und jetzt in dieser Position sind in der Bundesliga und in Europa"", resümierte Leverkusens Trainer später in den Katakomben der altehrwürdigen Arena.\nWobei er den größten Fortschritt der Kicker des Tabellensechsten zwischen den Ohren bewirkt hat. ""Wir haben geholfen, aber am meisten liegt es an den Spielern. Der Kopf muss stimmen. Ich habe immer gesagt, wir haben die Qualität, aber der Kopf ist wichtiger. Im Moment haben wir ein gutes Zusammenspiel zwischen Qualität und der Mentalität.  Dadurch haben wir es bis hierher geschafft"", erklärte der Spanier, um direkt deutlich zu machen, dass Anderlecht nur eine Zwischenstation gewesen sein soll, mit den Worten ""Und wir wollen mehr!"".\nNicht nur für einen Titelsammler wie Xabi Alonso kann dies einzig bedeuten, die Europa League zu gewinnen. ""Jetzt haben wir noch eine Reise. Wir werden sehen, wohin sie geht"", philosophierte der 41-Jährige und meinte damit sicher nicht nur den nächsten Gegner, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch in Rom in der Verlängerung zwischen der AS und Feyenoord Rotterdam\xa0(4:1 für Rom n.V.) ermittelt wurde. Der insgesamt erwachsene Auftritt in Belgien, bei dem Bayer einzig in der Viertelstunde nach dem 1:3 der Gastgeber ins Wanken geriet, deklariert den Bundesligisten als Titelanwärter.\nDer Wandel der Werkself unter Xabi Alonso ist mittlerweile unverkennbar. Und der Reifegrad dieser Mannschaft wurde in den 90 Minuten in Anderlecht gerade darin offenkundig, dass es eine Leistung der Leverkusener war, die über Jahre als völlig untypisch eingeordnet worden wäre. So präsentierte sich das Team in der Defensive mit einem überragenden Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah über eine Stunde lang so stabil, dass die keineswegs enttäuschenden Belgier bis dahin zu keiner ernsthaften Chance kamen. Erst als Xabi Alonso den starken Edmond Tapsoba aufgrund muskulärer Probleme in der Dreierkette durch Odilon Kossounou ersetzen musste, geriet der Bundesligist zwischenzeitlich in Bedrängnis.\nUmgekehrt zeigte sich Bayer, über Jahre der Inbegriff für Chancenwucher, bis auf die Endphase in der Offensive brutal effizient. Wobei man bei aller Euphorie im Leverkusener Lager anmerken muss, dass Saint-Gilles mit groben Aussetzern beim ersten und dritten Treffer der Werkself extrem in die Karten spielte.\nDass sich mit Mitchel Bakker zur Krönung des Unerwarteten ein Problemprofi zum herausragenden Akteur dieser Partie aufschwang, war die Pointe dieser phantastischen Reise, die Bayer unter Xabi Alonso im Zeitraffer absolviert hat. Der niederländische linke Schienenspieler, der in dieser Saison lang nur durch sportliche wie disziplinarische Aussetzer aufgefallen war, erzielte nicht nur das 2:0, provozierte nicht nur durch sein energisches Nachsetzen gegen Union-Keeper Anthony Moris dessen Fehlpass auf Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong vor dem 3:0 und setzte nicht nur mit einem feinen Zuspiel Moussa Diaby mit dem vorletzten Pass beim 4:1 durch Adam Hlozek in Szene, sondern präsentierte sich auch spielerisch ansprechend, defensiv solide sowie extrem einsatzfreudig.\nNicht umsonst stellte Kapitän Lukas Hradecky auf das ganze Team und speziell auf Bakker, der vor wenigen Wochen noch aus dem Spieltagsaufgebot gegen Hertha BSC gestrichen worden war, weil er das Abschusstraining verpennt hatte, fest: ""Alle kleinen Dinge kommen zusammen. Er hat richtig reagiert auf seine Suspendierung. Heute hatte er drei oder vier Lungen. Wie viel er läuft und was er momentan für die Mannschaft tut, ist großartig. Heute war das nicht Europa-League-Niveau, sondern Champions-League-Niveau von ihm.""\nKomplettiert wurde die These, dass Bayer eine Spitzenmannschaft wird, von der Bedeutung von Florian Wirtz in dieser Partie. Lautete die Gleichung bislang: Nur wenn Wirtz stark ist, ist auch Bayer stark, so wurde auch dieses scheinbare Naturgesetz am Donnerstag außer Kraft gesetzt. So war Leverkusens Genie mal eben nicht die spielentscheidende Figur, erlaubte sich bei aller spielerischer Klasse auf engstem Raum und wichtigen Pässen, um dem belgischen Pressing zu entgehen, auch ungewohnte Ballverluste, wie den vor dem 1:3. Dass der Werksklub trotzdem so überzeugend auftrat, ist das letzte, aber vielleicht auch klarste Indiz dafür, dass Xabi Alonsos Arbeit zu etwas Großem führen kann.\nDer Trainer jedenfalls möchte in dem bisher Geleisteten trotz eines positiven Zwischenfazits nur einen Anfang sehen. ""Ich habe vom ersten Tag an gesagt, wenn wir fragil sind, wenn wir nicht wie eine Mannschaft zusammen verteidigen, dann ist das nicht möglich. Jetzt verteidigen wir gut, spielen kompakt und haben immer die Qualität, Chancen zu erspielen. Jetzt haben wir diese Entwicklung"", konstatierte Xabi Alonso, ""aber es ist zu früh, eine Saisonanalyse zu machen. Wir haben noch fünf, sechs Wochen, danach kann man noch besser analysieren."" Und noch viel mehr erreicht haben.\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

In der Offensive wenig Akzente, dafür enormer Einsatz für die Mannschaft. Note 3.\nMitchel Bakker: Ein Monster-Spiel des Niederländers. Volley-Abnahme zum 2:0, dann setzte er Union-Keeper Moris derart unter Druck, dass dieser Frimpong den Ball zum 3:0 „auflegte“. Auch das 4:1 leitete Bakker ein. Mehr geht nicht – bester Auftritt im Bayer-Trikot. Weltklasse. Note 1.\nMoussa Diaby: Der Franzose schoss das schnellste Europa-League-Tor der Saison. Auch an der Entstehung des zweiten und vierten Treffers entscheidend beteiligt. Note 2.\n\nFlorian Wirtz springt Mitchel Bakker auf den Rücken vor Freude\nAdam Hlozek: Stand überraschend in der Startelf und zahlte dieses Vertrauen eindrucksvoll zurück mit einer Super-Flanke auf Bakker zum 2:0 und seinem Abstauber zum 4:1, der das Spiel endgültig entschied. Note 2.\nFlorian Wirtz: Sorgte direkt für Unruhe in Unions Abwehr, was zum 1:0 durch Diaby führte. Sein Pass auf Diaby leitete den Traumkonter zum 2:0 ein. Aber: Sein Ballverlust führte auch zum Anschlusstreffer der Belgier. Die entscheidenden Szenen hatten diesmal andere, wobei sein kämpferischer Einsatz herausragend war. Note 3.\nKerem Demirbay (ab 59./für Amiri): Wie in den letzten Wochen mit einer guten Leistung. Er sorgte nach seiner Hereinnahme vor allem dafür, dass Bayer in der Druckphase der Belgier wieder die Kontrolle fand. Note 2.\n\nStolz auf seine Sieger: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nOdilon Kossounou (ab 59./für Tapsoba): Der Ivorer musste für den angeschlagenen Tapsoba die rechte Abwehrseite übernehmen, hatte in der Drangphase der Belgier auch einige Probleme, arbeitete sich aber von Minute zu Minute besser ins Spiel. Note 3.\nAmine Adli (ab 71./für Frimpong): Am Ende reichte es beim Franzosen zumindest für einen Joker-Einsatz, hatte kurz vor Schluss eine gute Schusschance. Note 3.\nSardar Azmoun (ab 86./für Hlozek): Der Iraner hatte in der Nachspielzeit zwei gute Möglichkeiten, vergab jedoch beide. Ohne Note.\nKarim Bellarabi (ab 86./für Diaby): Auch der Fan-Liebling bekam seine Chance, scheitert aber frei vor Torwart Moris. Ohne Note.\nXabi Alonso: Seine Mannschaft gewann über eine starke Defensive und effektive Offensive das Spiel deutlich. Kluge Wechsel in den richtigen Momenten brachten die Belgier in ihrer Drangphase aus dem Konzept. Sein Team ist seit zwölf Pflichtspielen unbesiegt, Alonsos Anteil an dieser Stabilität ist enorm.

"{'content': 'Der Traum vom Europa-League-Titel für Manchester United ist geplatzt. Die „Red Devils"" mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer mussten sich klar gegen den FC Sevilla geschlagen geben. Bayer Leverkusen zieht ins Halbfinale ein.\nFür Marcel Sabitzer und Manchester United ist der Traum vom Europa-League-Titel beim sechsfachen Rekordgewinner FC Sevilla geplatzt. Die späten Gegentore vom 2:2 im Heimhinspiel rächten sich am Donnerstag ebenso wie zwei peinliche Schnitzer, die Engländer unterlagen mit 0:3 (0:1) und müssen die anvisierte Champions-League-Qualifikation nun über die Premier League schaffen. Sevillas Halbfinalgegner am 11. und 18. Mai ist Juventus Turin, das die Hürde Sporting Lissabon nahm.\nMit Gernot Trauner (bis 106.) und Feyenoord Rotterdam musste sich ein weiterer ÖFB-Teamspieler verabschieden. In der Verlängerung gingen die Niederländer bei Salzburgs Zwischenrunden-Bezwinger AS Roma mit 1:4 (1:2,0:0) in die Knie. Die von Jose Mourinho trainierten Römer bekommen es nun mit Bayer Leverkusen zu tun, das nach einem 4:1 (2:0) über Union Saint-Gilloise Deutschlands letzte Hoffnung auf einen Europacuptitel ist.\nIn Sevilla bekam Sabitzer, nach einer leichten Blessur vor dem jüngsten Premier-League-Spiel rechtzeitig wieder fit geworden, die Motivation der Gastgeber gleich zu Beginn zu spüren. Kaum hatte man den Steirer nach einem Check an der Seitenlinie von Sevillas Ersatzbank ""geschält"", kam es aber wesentlich schlimmer für die Engländer. Harry Maguire, Eigentorschütze im Hinspiel, eröffnete dem aktuellen Tabellen-13. von La Liga mit einem kapitalen Rückpassfehler die Chance aufs 1:0, Youssef En-Nesyri nützte das trocken aus (8.).\nIm Gegensatz zum letztwöchigen Duell, als United nach schnellen Sabitzer-Toren es verabsäumte, einen klareren Erfolg gegen die lange handzahmen Spanier herauszuschießen, war Sevilla diesmal das tonangebende Team. Kurz vor der Pause zählte der nächste Treffer von Lucas Ocampos (42.) wegen Abseits\' aber nicht, quasi mit Wiederbeginn holte Sevilla das nach. Per Kopf und Unterlatte traf Loic Bade nach Corner zum 2:0 und damit zur Vorentscheidung. United legte in der Folge zwar zu, blieb aber ohne klare Chancen. Sabitzer machte in der 68. Minute Platz für Fred, im Finish schlug En-Nesyri nach schwerem Patzer von United-Goalie David DeGea ein weiteres Mal zu (81.).\nJuventus ging bei Sporting Lissabon, beflügelt von der Suspendierung der 15-Punkte-Abzugs in der Serie A Stunden davor, dank Adrien Rabiot (9.) in Führung, musste nach dem 1:0-Sieg im Hinspiel aber hart arbeiten. Denn die Portugiesen fanden durch den Foulelfer von Marcus Edwards (20.) die richtige Antwort und hatten durchaus noch Möglichkeiten auf den Führungstreffer zum 2:1, der sie zumindest in die Verlängerung gebracht hätte.\nDie AS Roma brauchte im Olympiastadion gegen Feyenoord genau eine Stunde, ehe Leonardo Spinazzola mit dem 1:0 das Hinspielergebnis egalisierte. Die Gäste wähnten sich im Finish dank ""Joker"" Igor Paixao (80.) bereits im Halbfinale, ehe Roma-Star Paulo Dybala (89.) mit dem 2:1 die Verlängerung erzwang. Dort wurden Stephan El Shaarawy (101.) und Lorenzo Pellegrini (108.) zu den Matchwinnern. Die Roma kann im Jahr nach dem Triumph in der Conference League nun auch vom Titel in der zweithöchsten Kategorie träumen.\nLeverkusen führte in Brüssel dank Traumstart durch Moussa Diaby (2.) und später Mitchel Bakker (37.) sowie Jeremie Frimpong (60.) mit 3:0 und ließ sich den Aufstieg nicht mehr nehmen. Zudem traf Adam Hlozek (79.) für die Deutschen, Casper Terho (65.) erzielte das Ehrentor für die Gastgeber.\nIn der Conference League kam AC Fiorentina zuhause dank zweier später Tore von Riccardo Sottil (78.) und Gaetano Castrovilli (92.) gegen Lech Posen von 0:3 noch auf 2:3 zurück und erreichte so mit dem Gesamtscore von 6:4 das Halbfinale, in dem der FC Basel wartet. OGC Nizza lag gegen die Schweizer durch Gaetan Laborde (9.) auf Aufstiegskurs, ließ sich im Finish das Glück aber noch entreißen. Jean-Kevin Augustin (86.) und Kasim Adams in der Verlängerung (98.) belohnten die Leistungssteigerung der Schweizer spät aber doch. Das Team von Ex-Sturm-Graz-Coach Heiko Vogel kam mit 2:1 und gesamt 4:3 weiter.\nAZ Alkmaar machte mit dem 2:0 nach 90 bzw. 120 Minuten gegen RSC Anderlecht das 0:2 aus dem Hinspiel wett und setzte sich im Elferschießen mit 4:1 durch. Die Niederländer treffen auf West Ham United, das nach 0:1-Rückstand gegen KAA Gent innerhalb von neun Minuten durch Lucas Paqueta (55.), Declan Rice (58.) und Michail Antonio (63.) die perfekte Wende schaffte und schließlich 4:1 bzw. gesamt 5:2 siegte.\n(APA)\nZum „Das Wichtigste des Tages“ Newsletter anmelden\nDer einzigartige Journalismus der Presse.

Bei zahlreichen Topklubs hat sich der Niederländer bereits auf das Transferradar gespielt haben. Dennoch glauben die VfL-Verantwortlichen daran, dass sie den 21-Jährigen noch halten können.\nDurchgesetzt: Micky van de Ven im Duell mit Leverkusens Moussa Diaby (re.).\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/regios24\nEs gibt nur noch zwei Feldspieler in dieser bald zu Ende gehenden Bundesligasaison, die noch nicht eine Spielminute verpasst haben: Freiburgs erfahrener Weltmeister Matthias Ginter (29) - und Wolfsburgs Shootingstar Micky van de Ven. Am Mittwoch feiert der Niederländer seinen erst 22. Geburtstag, für Trainer Niko Kovac ist er dennoch bereits eine unverzichtbare Größe. ""Mein Herz lacht, ich freue mich, ich bin begeistert"", gerät der Förderer auf kicker-Nachfrage ins Schwärmen. ""Micky ist ein toller Junge, ein richtig guter Fußballer."" Der mit seinen Auftritten Begehrlichkeiten weckt und die Frage aufwirft: Wie lange verteidigt er noch für den VfL?\nMarcel Schäfer gibt sich ganz entspannt bei dieser Thematik. Einerseits, weil der Geschäftsführer den Vertrag mit dem Innenverteidiger gerade erst bis 2027 und ohne Ausstiegsklausel verlängert hat. Andererseits, weil es zur VfL-Philosophie gehören soll, dass Spieler wie van de Ven, der im Sommer 2021 für 3,5 Millionen Euro vom damaligen Zweitligisten FC Volendam kam, nach entsprechender positiver Entwicklung in Wolfsburg mit sattem Gewinn verkauft werden. Der Niederländer soll, so der Wunsch, eines Tages zum Gesicht dieser Strategie werden. Van de Ven hält seine Zukunft trotz Verlängerung offen und bestätigte unlängst das Interesse anderer Klubs. Er sagt: ""Man weiß nie, was die Zukunft bringt.""\nVor allem viel Geld muss derjenige mitbringen, der den Abwehrmann verpflichten möchte. Boss Schäfer beschreibt die Vorzüge seines Spielers: ""Linksfuß, extremes Tempo, spielt jede Sekunde. Micky bringt über die ganze Saison konstant sehr gute Leistungen."" Und hat, wie der Manager und auch Coach Kovac betonen, trotzdem noch reichlich Entwicklungspotenzial. Gleichwohl ragt der 1,93-Meter-Mann schon jetzt heraus, ist mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 35,97 km/h der schnellste Innenverteidiger der Liga. Am Sonntag gegen Leverkusen (0:0) nahm er es ohne Probleme mit Bayers Topsprintern Moussa Diaby, den Xabi Alonso zur zweiten Hälfte dann lieber auf die linke Seite verschob, und Jeremie Frimpong auf. ""Das war à la bonne heure"", schwärmt Kovac, ""was er im Moment zeigt, ist schon außerordentlich."" Und wird europaweit registriert.\nDass es Interesse an van de Ven gibt, ist den Wolfsburger Entscheidern bekannt, offizielle Anfragen gebe es aber noch keine. Vor allem interessierte Klubs aus England können sich aber schon mal daran orientieren, was auf der Insel zuletzt so für Innenverteidiger über den Tisch ging. Chelsea zahlte für Wesley Fofana (22) stolze 80 Millionen Euro an Leicester City, van de Vens Landsmann Sven Botman (23), wie der Wolfsburger ein Linksfuß, war Newcastle United beim Wechsel von Lille in die Premier League 37 Millionen Euro wert. Kurzum: Unter 40 Millionen wird bei entsprechender Entwicklung nach kicker-Informationen kaum etwas gehen.\nLiebend gerne würde Wolfsburg seinen Emporkömmling aber mindestens noch ein Jahr halten. Und sieht dafür nicht nur wegen van de Vens signalisierter Bereitschaft (""Die Chance ist groß"") durchaus gute Argumente für sich. ""Ich vermute"", sagt Schäfer, ""ohne, dass ich mit ihm gesprochen habe, dass die Nationalmannschaft ein Thema werden kann für ihn. Nächstes Jahr ist ein großes Turnier, vorher ist es immer der wichtigste Faktor, dass du spielst, unangefochtener Stammspieler bist. Ich glaube, diese Perspektive können wir ihm auch im nächsten Jahr bieten.""\nHält die EM in Deutschland van de Ven, der es im Winter schon in den vorläufigen WM-Kader geschafft hatte, beim VfL? ""Micky hat eine große Karriere vor sich, wenn er gesund und normal bleibt"", ist Niko Kovac überzeugt. ""Ich drücke ihm die Daumen."" Zu gerne würde der Trainer seinen Shootingstar aber noch über den Sommer hinaus fördern. ""Er muss noch ein paar Jahre hierbleiben"", wünscht sich der 51-Jährige, ""dann kann er irgendwann gehen …""\nThomas Hiete\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de
"{'content': 'Die Siegesserie von Bayer Leverkusen ist gerissen. Für das Team von Trainer Xabi Alonso reichte es im Auswärtsspiel am Sonntag beim VfL Wolfsburg nur zu einem 0:0, zuvor hatte Bayer fünfmal in Folge in der Fußball-Bundesliga gewonnen. Das torlose Remis taugt auch nur bedingt als Mutmacher für das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der Europa League am kommenden Donnerstag bei Union Saint-Gilloise (Hinspiel 1:1). In der Bundesliga-Tabelle bleibt Leverkusen Sechster, der VfL belegt mit vier Punkten Rückstand weiter den neunten Platz.\nBayer-Coach Alonso rotierte im Vergleich zur Europacup-Partie gegen den belgischen Club Union Saint-Gilloise auf fünf Positionen und ließ unter anderem die Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz und Jonathan Tah zunächst auf der Bank. ""Heute brauchen wir etwas anderes"", sagte der Weltmeister von 2010 vor dem Anpfiff.\nAllerdings merkte man der zuletzt besten Bundesliga-Mannschaft die hohe Belastung durch die internationalen Spiele merklich an. Die langen Bälle auf die von VfL-Trainer Niko Kovac als ""flinken Jungs"" bezeichneten Offensiv-Stars um Moussa Diaby kamen nur selten an.

Wolfsburg befreite sich und hatte durch den eingewechselten Patrick Wimmer die Chance auf den Siegtreffer. Der Offensivspieler scheiterte aber am gut reagierenden Hradecky. Auf der Gegenseite vergab Amine Adli (88.).\nBeim Jubiläum von Trainer Urs Fischer hat der 1. FC Union Berlin einen großen Schritt Richtung Champions League verpasst. Im 200. Pflichtspiel ihres Trainers an der Seitenlinie kamen die Eisernen am Sonntag gegen den VfL Bochum nur zu einem 1:1 (1:0). Josip Juranovic (45.+3 Minute) brachte die Gastgeber im Stadion an der Alten Försterei mit einem sehenswerten Freistoßtor in Führung. Kevin Stöger (55.) erzielte per Foulelfmeter aber den Ausgleich für den Revierclub.\nIn der Schlussphase mühten sich Berliner trotz Unterzahl nach der Gelb-Roten-Karte für Paul Jaeckel (62.) noch um den Siegtreffer. Immerhin konnte die imposante Serie von ungeschlagenen Heimspielen auf 20 Partien ausgebaut werden. Union zog durch das Remis wieder an RB Leipzig auf den dritten Platz der Fußball-Bundesliga vorbei, hat mit 52 Punkten aber nur einen Zähler Vorsprung auf die Sachsen und zwei auf den SC Freiburg, der als Fünfter jenseits der Königsklassen-Ränge steht. Bochum konnte durch den wacker erkämpften Punkt als 15. den Vorsprung auf die Abstiegszone auf drei Zähler ausbauen.\nViel ""Schärfe"" hatte Fischer in dem Duell mit dem Revierclub erwartet. Mit Schmackes legte wie vom Schweizer erhofft sein Team los. Rani Khedira wurde gleich beim ersten Angriff gerade noch von einem Gegenspieler am Einschuss gehindert. Danilho Doekhis Versuch nach dem folgenden Eckball ging über das Tor. Der Niederländer hatte kurz darauf eine weitere Chance, doch der Schuss geriet zu lasch.\nBochums Zutaten für einen attraktiven frühen Fußball-Abend waren limitiert. Ambitionen auf einen eigenen Torerfolg wurden erstmal hinten angestellt. In der Bochumer Defensive musste der Ex-Unioner Keven Schlotterbeck (12.) früh mit Verdacht auf eine Knieverletzung raus, für ihn kam der aktuell aus Berlin ausgeliehene Dominique Heintz.\nDa sich die Berliner gegen die Körperlichkeit des VfL schwertaten, geriet das Spiel zäh. Kevin Behrens, der sich als Zielspieler im Duell mit Bochums Blocker Ivan Ordets mächtig aufrieb, setzte einen Kopfball (20.) am Tor vorbei.\nFischer wirkte ziemlich unruhig, fast schon genervt. Nach einem Wortdisput mit Schiedsrichter Tobias Stieler über eine offenkundig falsche Einwurf-Entscheidung bearbeitete der Coach ein großes freigetretenes Rasenstück direkt vor seiner Trainerbank mit Händen und Füßen.\nUnweit des geflickten Grüns setzte Jerome Roussillon (37.) wenig später zu einer Flanke an, die verunglückte und wurde gerade dadurch gefährlich. Das Winken zur Entwarnung von VfL-Torwart Manuel Riemann war jedenfalls verfrüht. Der Ball klatschte auf die Latte.\nEinen Glücksschuss brauchten die Unioner –\xa0und sie bekamen ihn. In der Nachspielzeit trat Juranovic aus rund 25 Metern in zentraler Position zum Freistoß an und zirkelte den Ball über die Bochumer Mauer ins Tor. Haltbar für Riemann? Bayern-Schlussmann Yann Sommer hätte für ein vergleichbar nutzloses Fliegen in München sicher eine Torwart-Diskussion an der Backe.\nBochum musste nun mehr tun. Und, sieh an, sie taten mehr. Patrick Osterhage (47.) setzte eine Art Warnschuss knapp neben den Torwinkel. Ein ziemlich ungeschicktes Einsteigen von Aïssa Laïdouni gegen Ordets führte zum unstrittigen Elfmeterpfiff Stielers. Stöger schoss zum Ausgleich ein. Fischers Laune wurde noch schlechter, als sich Jaeckel für ein zweites plumpes Foul die Gelb-Rote Karte einhandelte. Der Union-Jubel über ein vermeintliches Eigentor von Riemann (66.) nach Schuss von Behrens war wertlos. Der Video-Referee erkannte eine Abseitsposition. Kurz vor Schluss hatte Behrens eine weitere Chance zum Sieg (85.).\nVergleichsportal\nGutscheine für Sport-Shops\n\n\n© G+J Medien GmbH\nZugang zu allen STERN PLUS-Inhalten und Artikeln aus dem Print-Magazin\nwerbefrei & jederzeit kündbar\nBereits registriert?'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

"{'content': 'Florian Wirtz machte nicht den Eindruck, als ob er mit sich hadern würde. „Natürlich“ hätte er sich „eine bessere Ausgangslage gewünscht“, sagte das Ausnahmetalent von Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Doch auch so sei er sich sicher, dass die Reise der Werkself durch Europa noch nicht zu Ende sei. „Ich bin mir sicher, dass wir das Rückspiel gewinnen werden“, erklärte der 19-Jährige nach dem 1:1 (0:0) im Hinspiel des Viertelfinals der Europa League gegen Union Saint-Gilloise am Donnerstagabend. Was ihn so zuversichtlich mache, wurde Wirtz gefragt. Aus seiner Antwort sprach gebündeltes Selbstvertrauen: „Weil wir eine richtig geile Mannschaft haben, weil unsere Qualität und unser Kampfgeist belohnt werden. Jeder von uns will das schaffen.“\nSeit knapp 44 Jahren spielen die Leverkusener in der Bundesliga. Es hat Höhen und Tiefen gegeben, immer einen gewissen Neid wegen der Finanzierung durch den Bayer-Konzern. Es gab Spott für knapp verpasste Titel („Vizekusen“), aber auch Lob für kultivierten Fußball und die Entwicklung von Talenten. Für eines jedoch stand Leverkusen nie: für Mentalität.\nDas jedoch ist in dieser Saison anders. Auch wenn sich die Mannschaft mit den defensivstarken Belgiern schwertat – keine andere deutsche Mannschaft arbeitet derzeit so zielstrebig an ihrer Weiterentwicklung wie die von Bayer. Seit zehn Pflichtspielen ist sie unbesiegt. Was nach einem völlig verpatzten Start in die Bundesligasaison mit fünf Niederlagen am Stück und acht sieglosen Spielen in Folge außerhalb jeder Vorstellungskraft lag, erscheint mittlerweile wieder realistisch: Mit einem Sieg am Sonntag beim VfL Wolfsburg (19.30 Uhr, DAZN und im WELT-Liveticker) könnte der aktuell Tabellensechste seine Ausgangsposition im Kampf um die Champions-League-Plätze abermals verbessern.\nZu verdanken wäre dies, darüber gibt es keine zwei Meinungen, allen voran Xabi Alsonso. Am 5. Oktober war der Baske auf den Schweizer Gerardo Seoane gefolgt. Damals war Bayer Vorletzter. Dann ging es aufwärts. Dabei war Alsonsos Vorgehensweise keineswegs revolutionär. Der 41-Jährige, der nach seiner erfolgreichen Spielerkarriere im Erwachsenenbereich nur die zweite Mannschaft von Real Sociedad San Sebastián trainiert hatte, griff auf Mittel zurück, die wohl viele Trainer in vergleichbaren Situationen gewählt hätten.\nEr stabilisierte die Defensive – auch mit Griffen in die taktische Mottenkiste. Er zog einen Mittelfeldspieler mit in die Abwehr und ließ ihn fast schon eine Art Libero spielen. So gab er dem verunsicherten Team Sicherheit. „Man muss nicht spektakulär spielen“, sagte er. Alsonso hielt die Spieler an, das zu spielen, was sie am besten können: auf Konter. So wurde die Last der Verantwortung, die unter Seoane, dessen Stil mehr auf Ballbesitz ausgerichtet war, zu spüren war, deutlich geringer. Zudem konnte so die Tatsache, dass Torjäger Patrick Schick wegen hartnäckiger Leistenprobleme fast durchgehend fehlte, kompensiert werden.\nStattdessen zeigten andere Profis ihre Qualitäten. Die schnellen Flügelspieler Jeremie Frimpong, Moussa Diaby (rechts) und Amine Adli (links) wurden zu Bayers schärfsten Waffen. Der Franzose Adli, 22, erzielte fünf Pflichtspieltreffer, sechs Tore bereitete er vor. Der Niederländer Frimpong, 22, kommt auf acht Treffer und neun Vorbereitungen. Für Diaby, der es sogar in Frankreichs WM-Kader schaffte, stehen sogar 13 Treffer und neun Vorbereitungen zu Buche. Der 23-Jährige hat sich zu einem der begehrtesten Transferobjekte Europas entwickelt. Manchester United hat bereits sein Interesse signalisiert.\nAus dem, was Alonso zunächst unter dem Oberbegriff „Schadensbegrenzung“ eingeleitet hat, ist längst unterhaltsamer, offensiver Fußball geworden. In den vergangenen Wochen machte die Mannschaft noch mal einen Sprung: Wirtz, der bis zur WM-Pause wegen eines Kreuzbandrisses außer Gefecht war, kommt immer besser in Form. Dank seiner Pässe ist Bayer nun für die Gegner noch schwerer auszurechnen. Gegen Saint-Gilles rettete der Techniker zumindest den einen Punkt – und die Hoffnung auf das Halbfinale.\nDie Fans sind begeistert. Das war am Donnerstag nach dem Schlusspfiff spürbar, als das Team mit viel Applaus verabschiedet wurde. Es ist lange her, dass sich Leverkusen so stimmungs- und hoffnungsvoll präsentiert hat wie derzeit. Bereits die Ankunft des Mannschaftsbusses an der BayArena vor dem Spiel war zu einem Spektakel geworden: Er wurde von Tausenden Fans in Empfang genommen.\nDie positive Atmosphäre genießt vor allem Fernando Carro. Der Spanier, seit knapp fünf Jahren Geschäftsführer der Bayer 04 Fußball GmbH, hatte sich schon darauf eingestellt, im kommenden Sommer Spieler verkaufen zu müssen. „Wir müssen Transfererträge erzielen. Besonders abhängig davon, ob wir international spielen oder nicht“, hatte er Ende vergangenen Jahres gesagt – als eine erneute Europapokal-Teilnahme vermeintlich illusorisch war. Dass dies mittlerweile anders aussieht, könnte seinen Spielraum erweitern und zumindest eine bessere Verhandlungsposition bedeuten – wenn, wie zu erwarten, die Topklubs wegen Diaby oder Wirtz vorstellig werden.\nZu verdanken hätten die Leverkusener dies vor allem Alsonso, der gleich bei seiner ersten größeren Cheftrainerposition das erkennen lässt, was mehrere prominente Trainer und Funktionäre schon immer geahnt hatten. José Mourinho, der Alonso in Madrid trainierte, sagte, dass der damalige Weltklasse-Mittelfeldspieler schon damals „wie ein Trainer“ gedacht habe.\n„Ich wette, dass er Trainer sein wird, wo immer er auch will“, hatte einige Jahre darauf Pep Guardiola über Alonso gesagt – als der sein Spieler beim FC Bayern war. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, der ehemalige Vorstandschef der Bayern, hatte unlängst erklärt, dass er vor einigen Jahren vergeblich versucht hatte, ihn als Co-Trainer nach München zu holen. „Ich habe es mir immer gewünscht, dass er eines Tages Trainer wird“, so Rummenigge.\nMittlerweile ist Xabi Alonso auf bestem Weg, sein Gesellenstück zu machen. Zugute kommt ihm dabei die Aura, als Spieler so ziemlich alles gewonnen zu haben: Er wurde spanischer und deutscher Meister, gewann mit Liverpool und Real Madrid die Champions League und mit Spanien die Welt- und zweimal die Europameisterschaft. Das sichert ihm Autorität in der Kabine.\nDoch darauf ruht er sich nicht aus. In Leverkusen fällt er dadurch auf, dass er permanent arbeitet – mit der Mannschaft und anschließend, nach dem Team-Training, auch häufig mit einzelnen Spielern. Er will jeden Profi besser machen. Wenn dann noch Zeit bleibt, versucht Xabi Alsonso, sein bereits rechts passables Deutsch zu verbessern. Letzteres, verriet er kürzlich der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“, falle ihm immer noch am schwersten. Er sei skeptisch, ob es ihm jemals gelingen wird, „der, die, das“ korrekt zu verwenden.\n\nDie WELT als ePaper: Die vollständige Ausgabe steht Ihnen bereits am Vorabend zur Verfügung – so sind Sie immer hochaktuell informiert.

Dies gibt Trainer Xabi Alonso gute Gründe zu rotieren. Ein Argument für personelle Wechsel lässt er aber unbeachtet.\nLeverkusens Coach Xabi Alonso steht vor der ""Endspiel-Woche"" vor einem Spagat.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Chai v.d. Laage\nDer Idealfall ist ausgeblieben. Auch wenn nicht damit zu rechnen war, so stellte es doch für Verantwortliche wie Spieler bei Bayer 04 ein Wunschszenario dar, das erste Viertelfinalspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise so deutlich zu gewinnen, dass man am Donnerstag in Brüssel vielleicht den einen oder anderen Stammspieler hätte schonen können. Nach dem 1:1 ist diese Konstellation nicht gegeben - erwartungsgemäß.\nSo steht Xabi Alonso mit Bayer 04 innerhalb von acht Tagen vor drei Endspielen: Am Sonntag (19.30 Uhr, LIVE! bei kicker) in Wolfsburg sollte der Werksklub keinen Boden auf den Viertplatzierten RB Leipzig verlieren, der derzeit fünf Punkte Vorsprung hat und nächste Woche in der Bay-Arena aufkreuzt. Am Donnerstag folgt das Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise, bei dem das Duell ums Halbfinale bei Null beginnt. Und am übernächsten Sonntag steigt für Bayer 04 das Finale um die letzte Chance, in der Liga noch ein Ticket für die Königsklasse zu lösen, mit dem Heimspiel gegen RB.\nPrioritäten zu setzen, ist folglich für Xabi Alonso unmöglich. Ordnet er doch schon die erste Partie in Wolfsburg, zu der Bayer erst am Morgen des Spieltags anreisen wird, als ""sehr wichtiges Spiel für uns"" ein. Logisch, ist ein erfolgreiches Abschneiden doch Voraussetzung dafür, dass das Duell mit Leipzig überhaupt zu einem Endspiel um Platz 4 für Bayer 04 wird.\nSo dürfte der Wille zur Rotation nicht ganz so groß sein, wie er es noch im Februar war, als der Trainer beispielsweise nach dem 3:2-Sieg in Monaco im nächsten Spiel in Freiburg Topstar Florian Wirtz vor der Pause schonte. Trotzdem wird der Spanier sein Personal zumindest teilweise wechseln. ""Wir müssen an das nächste Spiel denken, aber auch an das Rückspiel am Donnerstag"", beschreibt Xabi Alonso den für ihn anstehenden Spagat.\nBei Exequiel Palacios dürfte der Trainer keinerlei Risiko eingehen. ""Bei ihm bestehen die größten Zweifel"" sagte Xabi Alonso am Freitag über den Mittelfeldspieler, der in der Halbzeit über Oberschenkelprobleme geklagt hatte und deswegen ausgewechselt worden war. \xa0Für den Argentinier dürfte Kerem Demirbay beginnen, der den Part des Weltmeisters gegen Saint-Gilles in der zweiten Hälfte zufriedenstellend übernahm.\nEin anderer Wechsel könnte nicht aus Belastungsgründen erfolgen. Nachdem Sardar Azmoun zuletzt als Joker auf Schalke und gegen Frankfurt als Torschütze gestochen hatte, bereitete er nun gegen die Belgier den Ausgleich vor. Gegen ebenfalls defensivstarke Wolfsburger könnte der Iraner den Startelfplatz von Amine Adli erhalten und als richtiger Mittelstürmer hilfreich sein, so wie er es gegen die Belgier war. ""Sardar hatte einen guten Einfluss auf Spiel - nicht nur gegen Saint-Gilles"", lobt Xabi Alonso, der dann die bisherige falsche Neun Wirtz hinter Azmoun positionieren könnte, denn: ""Flo kann diese Position sehr gut spielen, wenn er einen Stürmer vor sich hat.""\nUnd auch ein Wechsel im hintersten Mannschaftsteil liegt nahe, auch wenn Xabi Alonso die drohende Gelbsperren für Jeremie Frimpong und Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba nicht in seine Überlegungen für die Aufstellung einfließen lässt, wie der 41-Jährige erklärt: ""Wenn sie spielen, besteht zwar das Risiko, dass sie ihre fünfte Gelbe Karte sehen, aber das ist für mich kein Argument, sie nicht spielen zu lassen."" Dennoch könnte Odilon Kossounou für einen der beiden Viel-Spieler beginnen.\nStärker dürfte die Rotation nicht ausfallen. Schließlich stellt Wolfsburg doch auch einen Mitbewerber um die internationalen Plätze dar, der Bayer besonders physisch alles abverlangen wird.  ""Sie sind eine der stärksten Mannschaften in der Liga mit viel Kraft, Intensität und Laufstärke. Es ist eine große Aufgabe für uns, nach dem Spiel gegen Saint-Gilles diese Intensität zu erreichen"", sagt Xabi Alonso, ""sie sind ein direkter Konkurrent.""  Den es zu schlagen gilt, um eine echte Endspiel-Woche zu bekommen.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Die ersten 90 Minuten dieses Viertelfinales belegen, dass die Mannschaft von Xabi Alonso vor einer brutal schweren Aufgabe steht.\nFlorian Wirtz hielt Bayer Leverkusen in der Spur.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Nordphoto\nEin 1:1 zu Hause in einem Viertelfinal-Hinspiel. Dazu noch gegen ein Team, gegen das man rein von der Papierform klarer Favorit war - auf den ersten Blick war das Ergebnis, das Bayer 04 gegen Union Saint-Gilloise am Donnerstag in der Bay-Arena erzielte eine Enttäuschung.\nDoch am Ende war es immerhin ein Unentschieden, das dem Bundesligisten durch den Wegfall der Auswärtstor-Regelung eine absolut neutrale Ausgangsposition bescherte, was während der 90 Minuten alles andere als selbstverständlich erschien.\nSchließlich lieferte der Tabellenzweite der Jupiler Pro League eine Demonstration höchster Verteidigungskunst ab. Wohl noch kein Team hielt in dieser Saison Bayer 04 so mannschaftlich geschlossen vom Tor fern, verteidigte so kompakt, so automatisiert ineinandergreifend, so dass die Elf von Xabi Alonso selbst ihre klaren Schnelligkeitsvorteile kaum ausspielen konnte. So war nicht nur Jeremie Frimpong auf der rechten Schiene selten so ausgebremst worden in seinem offensiven Treiben, wie in diesen 90 Minuten.\nFolglich behielt die Enttäuschung über das Resultat nicht die Oberhand gegenüber der Freude über das späte 1:1 von Florian Wirtz, der den Ball nach Vorarbeit des eingewechselten Sardar Azmoun aus etwa 20 Metern überlegt ins lange Eck platzierte.\nXabi Alonso sprach später von einem ""Pass"", mit dem der Jungstar den Ball im Netz ""geparkt"" habe. In der Tat war es ein höchst präzises Manöver auf engstem Raum, das nicht nur jedem Fahrschüler zu Ehre gereicht hätte. Das aber auch belegte, was nötig sein wird, um die Belgier zu bezwingen.\n""Es war ein sehr gut herausgespieltes Tor. Der Raum war sehr eng.  Da waren sieben Spieler unmittelbar um den Ball und zwei von uns. Das war von der Qualität her eine Riesentor. Das haben wir uns aber erarbeitet: Wir sind klar geblieben, haben immer weiter versucht, nach vorne zu spielen, auch wenn es nicht einfach war, weil die Lücken sehr, sehr klein waren"", fasste Sechser Robert Andrich den Leverkusener Treffer sowie die schwierige Aufgabe für die Werkself treffend zusammen.\nBis zu diesem 1:1 waren Bayer und Wirtz der Verzweiflung nahe. Die Belgier, die kurz nach der Pause nicht einmal unverdient in Führung gegangen waren, waren bis zu dem Kunstschuss des 19-Jährigen kaum zu knacken gewesen. Die beiden besten Chancen hatte vielmehr der zweimal durch den Fünfmeterraum irrlichternde Union-Keeper Anthony Moris ermöglicht, der jeweils eine Flanke unterlief und es nur der fehlenden Präzision der Schützen Piero Hincapie und Jeremie Frimpong, die ihre Kopfbälle aus wenigen Metern neben das Tor setzten, zu verdanken hatte, dass seine Fehler nicht bestraft wurden.\nDoch nachdem Bayer vor der Pause in zwei, drei Umschaltaktionen beim letzten Pass entweder unpräzise agiert oder die falsche Entscheidung getroffen hatte, entnervten die Belgier die Gastgeber mit der Zeit zusehends, was sogar ein Genie wie Wirtz in der Phase vor dem 1:1 dazu verleitete, den Ausgleich mit überhasteten Pässen in nicht vorhandene Räume erzwingen zu wollen.\nSaint-Gilles hatte Bayer kurz vor dem Kontrollverlust. Dass dieser aber nicht eintrat, war essentiell. ""Wir wussten, dass es so ein Spiel werden könnte. Natürlich möchtest du 2:0, 3:0 gewinnen, aber manchmal geht es halt nicht. Dann musst du das Spiel annehmen. Sie haben immer wieder den Rhythmus gebrochen. Wichtig war, dass wir im Kopf klar bleiben, die Ruhe bewahren, und dafür wurden wir mit dem Tor belohnt"", erklärte Andrich, der in dem 1:1 ""ein vernünftiges Ergebnis fürs Rückspiel"" sieht.\nTrotz aller von den Belgiern auf höchstem Niveau platzierter Hindernisse, zeigte sich der Mittelfeldspieler optimistisch. ""Das ist eine abgezockte Truppe, sie machen es einem nicht einfach. Aber wenn wir unsere Stärken auf den Platz bringen, bin ich zuversichtlich, dass wir weiterkommen."" Wobei es aber ja gerade das Problem darstellt, gegen Union sein eigenes Offensivspiel zu entfalten.\nSo dürfte es auch kommende Woche in Brüssel auf Details ankommen wie das Wirtzsche Parkmanöver oder die Präzision bei aussichtsreichsten Kopfballchancen. Viele solcher Momente dürften die Belgier auch dann nicht zulassen.\nBayer wird das Optimum in die Waagschale werfen müssen, um weiterzukommen. Ob Bayer dabei auf Andrichs Kollegen in der Doppelsechs, Exequiel Palacios, zurückgreifen kann, ist offen. Der Weltmeister musste zur Halbzeit angeschlagen raus, weil die hintere Oberschenkelmuskulatur sich meldete. ""Pala hatte ein ungutes Gefühl, aber nicht, dass etwas gerissen ist. Wir müssen abwarten"", erklärte Xabi Alonso.\nDer Einsatz des zuletzt so formstarken Palacios könnte wie zuletzt auch im Rückspiel ein entscheidendes Detail darstellen, in dem sich die Ausgangsposition gegenüber dem Hinspiel nicht verändert hat. ""Alles ist offen"", weiß der Trainer, der aber genauso den Hunger nach mehr formulierte wie Fernando Carro. ""Wir sind positiv, haben Selbstvertrauen"", sagte der Geschäftsführer, ""die Lust auf mehr ist schon da - bei allen.""\nWobei es vor allem die Lust zu Leiden und die mentale Stärke, nicht die Linie zu verlieren, sein werden, die Bayer gegen die konterstarken Defensivmonster von Union Saint-Gilloise aufbringen muss, um zum ersten Mal seit 2002 wieder ein europäisches Halbfinale zu erreichen.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

"{'content': 'Mit Florian Wirtz (r.) holte Bayer Leverkusen 25 Punkte\n„Ich kann ihn nicht genug loben. Er bringt eine ganz andere Dimension in unser Spiel.“ Das sagte Leverkusens Kapitän Lukas Hradecky (33) in der Sendung „Die Lage der Liga“ bei BILD-TV über Top-Talent Florian Wirtz (19).\nDas Wirtz-Comeback machte aus Krisen-Bayer wieder einen Europa-Kandidaten. Der Aufschwung der Werkself wäre ohne den Nationalspieler kaum möglich gewesen.\nWie abhängig  Bayer Leverkusen von Wirtz ist, belegen die Zahlen eindrucksvoll. Seit Beginn des Jahres mischt Wirtz wieder mit – seither sammelte nur  Borussia Dortmund mehr Punkte (31) als Leverkusen (25). Die Folge: Bayer kletterte zuletzt ins obere Tabellendrittel, ist in der  Bundesliga nach dem 3:1 über Frankfurt Sechster.\n„Er hat einen großen Einfluss auf unser Spiel, die Qualität, unser Mittelfeld mit den Stürmern zu verbinden. Wenn wir ihn in gefährliche Situationen bringen, kann immer was passieren. Wir brauchen ihn für die Zukunft. Ich sehe, wie Flo solche Spiele genießt“, sagte Trainer Xabi Alonso (41) nach dem Frankfurt-Spiel.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (r.) gratuliert Amine Adli (M.) nach seinem Tor gegen Frankfurt\nEin Wahnsinn: Sieben Mal spielte Wirtz in dieser Saison von Beginn an, 6 dieser Spiele wurden gewonnen. Sieg-Quote: 86 Prozent. Nur bei der Heimpleite gegen Dortmund (0:2) am 18. Spieltag gab es mit Starter Wirtz keinen Dreier.\nFehlte das Supertalent in der Startelf in dieser Bundesliga-Saison, sah das ganz anders aus: In 20 Partien gab es nur einen Sieg mehr als in den 7 Spielen mit Wirtz in der Startelf – das ist eine Sieg-Quote von gerade mal 35 Prozent. Der Punkteschnitt mit Startspieler Wirtz ist 2,57. Ohne ihn: 1,25!\n\nFast über den halben Platz! Alonso feiert dieses Adli-Solo\nAuch die individuellen Werte sind beeindruckend: 6 Treffer legte er auf und ist damit hinter Dortmunds Raphael Guerreiro ligaweit der beste Vorlagengeber im Jahr 2023. Mit dieser Ausbeute ist er zudem gemeinsam mit Moussa Diaby und Jeremie Frimpong bester Vorbereiter von Leverkusen – die waren aber seit Saisonstart dabei.\nInsgesamt sammelte Wirtz nach der Winterpause in 11 Einsätzen 7 Scorer-Punkte, ist in diesem Zeitraum gemeinsam mit Frimpong die Nummer 1 bei Bayer – alle 99 Minuten war Wirtz in dieser Bundesliga-Saison an einem Tor beteiligt.\n\nBelgiens Nationaltrainer Domenico Tedesco warnt Bayer Leverkusen vor Union Saint-Gilloise in der Europa League.\nLukas Hradecky von Bayer Leverkusen erzählte bei BILD-TV von seinem größten Schreckmoment.\nBILD Gutscheine\nBILD Vergleich\nPartnerangebote'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Der junge Franzose ist der Aufsteiger des Kalenderjahres bei Bayer 04 - und erweitert das Offensiv-Spektrum von Trainer Xabi Alonso entscheidend.\nEbnete den Weg zum jüngsten Bayer-Sieg mit seinem Führungstor gegen Frankfurt: Amine Adli.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Mika Volkmann\nWenn Bayer 04 am Donnerstag (21 Uhr, LIVE! bei kicker) Union Royal Saint-Gilloise zum Hinspiel im Viertelfinale der Europa League in der Bay-Arena empfängt, wird Xabi Alonso wieder vor der Entscheidung stehen, welchen seiner Angreifer er für die Startelf nominiert.\nZwei der drei Plätze sind fix vergeben: Moussa Diaby als halbrechter Stürmer im 3-4-3 gilt ebenso gesetzt wie Florian Wirtz, der formell als Mittelstürmer aus dieser Position heraus die gegnerischen Abwehrspieler anläuft, allerdings bei Leverkusener Ballbesitz alle Freiheiten bekommt, aus der Tiefe heraus ordnend wie kreativ zu wirken.\nDie verbleibende halblinke Position hat im Moment eigentlich Amine Adli inne. Diese war ursprünglich das anfangs von Xabi Alonso für Wirtz vorgesehene Betätigungsfeld, das der 19-Jährige einnehmen sollte, wenn Bayer in Person von Patrik Schick oder Sardar Azmoun mit einem richtigen Mittelstürmer begann. Doch dieser in der Wintervorbereitung ausgeheckte Plan wurde von Adli im positiven Sinne über den Haufen geworfen.\nNach einem Seuchenjahr mit schwerer Sehnenverletzung im Oberschenkel sowie einem Schlüsselbeinbruch hat der 22-jährige Adli einen Riesensprung gemacht, ist mit wettbewerbsübergreifend elf Torbeteiligungen in diesem Kalenderjahr Bayers bester Scorer, gemeinsam mit Wirtz. Auch am Samstag beim 3:1 gegen Frankfurt sorgte er mit seinem Treffer für das wichtige 1:0.\nAdli ist im Moment unter Leistungsaspekten schwer aus Leverkusens Startelf wegzudenken. ""Die Winterpause war sehr gut für mich, weil ich viel an meiner Physis arbeiten und auf mein bestes Level zurückkommen konnte"", erklärt dieser sein Leistungshoch.\nMit ihm haben wir mehr Möglichkeiten im Angriff. Das ist sehr wichtig. Er hat einen Schritt nach vorne gemacht.\n""In diesem Jahr hat er sich von Anfang an sehr gut entwickelt. Er zeigt Hunger, Intensität und er hat diese Qualität. Wenn er beides mixen kann, sehen wir, was für ein guter Spieler er sein kann. Er hat seit Gladbach (dem ersten Spiel nach der Winterpause, Anm. d. Red.) sehr gut gespielt. Mit ihm haben wir mehr Möglichkeiten im Angriff. Das ist sehr wichtig. Er hat einen Schritt nach vorne gemacht"", lobt sein Trainer Adlis Sprung vom Talent zum echten Faktor.\nEinen solchen soll er auch am Donnerstag gegen Union Royal Saint-Gilloise darstellen. Gegen den Tabellenzweiten aus Belgien, der Union Berlin nach einem 3:3 im Hinspiel schließlich im Achtelfinal-Rückspiel souverän mit 3:0 ausschaltete, sieht der französische U-21-Nationalspieler die Werkself trotz des eigenen Laufs mit zuletzt acht Siegen und einem Unentschieden aus den jüngsten neun Pflichtspielen nicht klar im Vorteil.\n""Wir haben eine gute Stimmung. Wir haben viel Selbstvertrauen"", erklärt Adi, ""aber jedes Spiel ist anders. Wir müssen das Spiel mit der Mentalität wie gegen Frankfurt beginnen, es wird ein hartes Stück Arbeit."" Von einem Duell David gegen Goliath möchte er zurecht nichts wissen. ""Wir dürfen nicht vergessen, dass wir auch Schwächen gezeigt haben. Wir müssen so weitermachen wie zuletzt, aber wir sind sicher kein Favorit"", betont er.\nEine Einstellung, die angesichts der tatsächlichen Stärke des internationalen Nonames aus der Region Brüssel angebracht ist. Denn Saint-Gilles gilt als eine Mannschaft mit der Defensivstärke von Union Berlin, die aber über deutlich größere spielerische Möglichketen verfügt als der Tabellendritte der Bundesliga. Dies sollte Warnung genug sein.\nAdli selbst könnte am Donnerstag ein Schlüssel werden. Bietet er doch einen variablen Mix aus Schnelligkeit, extrem hoher Laufbereitschaft, häufigen Antritten in die Tiefe, mit denen eine kompakte Abwehr in Bewegung gebracht werden muss, sowie einen guten Zug zum Tor, wegen dem er im Notfall sogar schon als Mittelstürmer aushalf.\nDa Sardar Azmoun zuletzt seine Jokerrolle gut annehm und sowohl auf Schalke als auch gegen Frankfurt jeweils nach Einwechslung traf, würde es nicht überraschen, wenn Xabi Alonso auch gegen die Belgier Adli dem Iraner vorzieht. Auch wenn Azmoun als richtiger Mittelstürmer auf den ersten Blick gegen kompakte Gäste als die bessere Wahl erscheint.\nDas variable Spiel von Leverkusens Offensiv-Trio kommt dem lieber aus hängender Position heraus in die Spitze stoßenden Adli deutlich mehr entgegen als eine starre Aufgabe in vorderster Linie. Mit A-Nationalspieler Moussa Diaby und dessen französischem Landsmann besitzt Wirtz so zwei extrem flinke Optionen für Pässe in die Tiefe, die durch den rechten Schienenspieler Jeremie Frimpong zusätzlich erweitert werden.\nIn Sachen Konterspiel verfügt Xabi Alonso mit Adli nun über eine noch größere Bandbreite, wodurch es für die Gegner noch schwieriger wird. Je nachdem, ob der Trainer auf den spielenden Mittelstürmer Azmoun oder den laufwütigen, aber auch technisch starken Tiefstarter Adli setzt, kann Xabi Alonso so unterschiedliche Akzente setzen.\nZuletzt funktionierte die Variante mit Adli bestens. ""Im Moment haben wir ein gutes Zusammenspiel. Ich glaube, aber, dass wir es noch verbessern können"", urteilt dieser kritisch. Für die nächsten Leverkusener Gegner dürfte dies keine gute Nachricht sein.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Auch dieses Spiel am Karsamstag hat keinen Ertrag gebracht. Wieder verloren, diesmal 1:3. Seit zehn Jahren geht das jetzt schon so für die Frankfurter Fußballprofis. Und auch der aktuelle Trainer Oliver Glasner hat es nicht geschafft, Leverkusen mit seiner Mannschaft entscheidend zu ärgern. „Das ist natürlich ein Rückschlag für uns“, sagte Markus Krösche. Der Sportvorstand der Eintracht meinte damit nicht nur das Abrutschen in der Tabelle von Platz sechs auf sieben. Er ärgerte sich auch darüber, dass es wieder einmal eine Verquickung individueller Fehler und Unzulänglichkeiten gewesen sei, die mit ausschlaggebend für den ernüchternden Nachmittag gewesen sei. Krösche sprach von einer „unnötigen Niederlage“ und äußerte in den Katakomben der Leverkusener Arena die Hoffnung, „dass wir diese Fehler abstellen“.\nZum dritten Mal nacheinander schon schenkte Glasner den selben elf Startspielern das Vertrauen. Die Hoffnung, nach Jahren voller Tristesse endlich etwas in Leverkusen zu erreichen, hatte nicht zuletzt durch den souveränen 2:0-Pokalerfolg gegen Union Berlin Auftrieb erhalten. Allein: Früh war erkennbar, dass für die Eintracht auch Ostern 2023 nichts zu holen sein würde. Diesmal dauerte es nur zehn Minuten, bis Bayer in Führung ging – und damit auch tabellarisch an den Frankfurtern vorbeizog. Schütze des verdienten Tores war der eifrige Amine Adli, der von einigen Fehlern in der Eintracht-Defensive profitierte. Erst hatte Aurelio Buta leichtfertig den Ball verloren, dann ließ es der zaudernde Evan Ndicka im Zweikampf an der letzten Konsequenz missen – und schon lag die Eintracht zurück.\n„Das ist bitter, dass wir so früh in Rückstand geraten“, sagte Glasner später in seiner kurzen Analyse. Die erste, einzige und nennenswerte Frankfurter Aktion im ersten Spielabschnitt war die Szene in der 13. Minute. Endlich einmal zirkulierte der Ball flott durch die Reihen. Sebastian Rode brachte auf der rechten Außenbahn Buta in Position. Dessen direkter Flankenball landete bei Philipp Max. Der Mann von der linken Außenbahn schoss sofort, doch Lukas Hradecky im Bayer-Tor war achtsam.\nKein Zweifel: Für die überlegenen Leverkusener schien Tor Nummer zwei im weiteren Verlauf nur eine Frage der Zeit zu sein. Nach einer knappen halben Stunde war es abermals Adli, dem sich nach einem Fehler des übereifrigen Kristijan Jakic eine weitere gute Einschussgelegenheit bot. In der 34. Minute war es dann soweit. Bayer erhöhte auf 2:0 – und eine neuerliche Niederlage der Eintracht in Leverkusen schien früh besiegelt. Schütze des zweiten Tores war Moussa Diaby: Ndicka fälschte dessen Schuss noch leicht ab. Weiteres Unheil drohte kurz vor der Pause, als Adli dem 3:0 sehr nah war. Doch Eintracht-Torwart Kevin Trapp verhinderte Schlimmeres. In der vorletzten Minute der dreiminütigen Nachspielzeit war die Gelegenheit für Bayer noch größer, Tor Nummer drei zu erzielen. Doch Adli traf den Ball aus drei Metern nicht richtig.\nIn der Vorbereitung auf die anspruchsvolle Auswärtspartie in Leverkusen hatte Eintracht-Trainer Glasner seinen Spielern nach dem Pokalerfolg einen freien Tag spendiert. Ziel: sich körperlich und mental zu erholen. Vom erhofften Frischefaktor war am Samstag zunächst kaum etwas zu sehen. Erst im zweiten Spielabschnitt zeigte die Frankfurter Mannschaft halbwegs ihr Gesicht.\nFrisch und unverbraucht war Ansgar Knauff, den Glasner in der zweiten Halbzeit für Buta in die Partie brachte. Der Dortmunder Leihspieler fügte sich sogleich mit einem Foulspiel ein, für das er verwarnt wurde. Auch Daichi Kamada bekam Einsatzzeit. Für ihn machte Rafael Borré in der 56. Minute Platz. Trotzdem waren es abermals die Rheinländer, die Kurs auf das Tor von Trapp nahmen, aber wieder scheiterte Diaby (56.). In der 64. Minute war Dienstschluss für Makoto Hasebe und Sebastian Rode. Tuta und Junior Dina Ebimbe sollten im Verbund mit den anderen Spielkameraden für das sorgen, was der Eintracht lange Zeit fehlte: Power, Schwung und Durchschlagskraft.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nAlle Infos und Themen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF.A.Z.-Sonderseite zu Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlle Teams im Überblick\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie aktuelle Tabelle der Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlles in der Übersicht\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpielplan der Bundesliga: Termine, Ergebnisse, Partien\nHoffnung kam auf, als Djibril Sow mit Übersicht und Feingefühl den Anschlusstreffer erzielte (74.). Es war zugleich das Startsignal, in der Schlussviertelstunde noch einmal alle Kräfte zu mobilisieren, um vielleicht doch noch den Ausgleich zu schaffen. Stattdessen aber waren es die Leverkusener, die am Ende der fünfminütigen Nachspielzeit eine weitere Kontersituation dazu nutzen, um für klare Verhältnisse zu sorgen. Als der Ball in Richtung Frankfurts Tor geschlagen wurde, unterlief Jakic ein kapitaler Fehler. Der Abwehrmann schätzte die Situation völlig falsch ein, denn anstatt zu köpfen, ließ er den Ball passieren. Eine willkommene Einladung für den eingewechselten Sardar Azmoun, alleine auf Trapp zuzulaufen, diesen zu umspielen und unbedrängt zum 3:1 für Bayer einzuschieben.\nWir haben viele Bälle viel zu einfach hergeschenkt“, klagte Rode später. Der Eintracht-Kapitän sprach ein Grundübel der Eintracht an diesem Samstag an: „Wir haben die entscheidenden Zweikämpfe verloren. Wir müssen einfach besser und konsequenter sein.“ Rodes Empfehlung für den Schlussspurt der Liga, in dem das Traumziel Europa nach dem 1:3 wieder etwas entrückt ist: „Es gilt, zu hoffen, zu kämpfen und zu arbeiten.“\nSein Trainer wollte überhaupt nicht in die Detailanalyse einsteigen. Dass er am kommenden Wochenende Ersatz für den in Leverkusen zum fünften Mal verwarnten Mario Götze finden muss, moderierte er lässig weg. Auch das Abrutschen auf Platz sieben interessierte ihn scheinbar nicht. „Ich schaue nicht auf die Tabelle. Ich schaue nur auf Borussia Mönchengladbach.“ Gladbach ist der nächste Heimspielgegner der Eintracht – und schon an diesem Sonntag gegen Wolfsburg gefordert. Sollte der VfL bei der Borussia gewinnen, würde auch er an der Eintracht im Klassement vorbeiziehen. Rechenspiele, von den Glasner nichts wissen wollte. „Wir haben jetzt Ostern. Das ist ein Friedensfest.

"{'content': 'Es war wohl reiner Selbstschutz. Aber es mutete schon kurios an, wie leicht Oliver Glasner sich an diesem bitteren Samstag provoziert fühlte.\nAm Sky-Mikrofon missfiel dem Trainer von Eintracht Frankfurt nach dem 1:3 (0:2) bei Bayer Leverkusen die Frage über Ex-Weltmeister Mario Götze, der wegen Meckerns seine fünfte Gelbe Karte gesehen hatte. ""Sie wollen mich provozieren"", sagte der Österreicher. Auf Nachfrage antwortete er nur: ""Frohe Ostern."" Und ging.\nWenige Minuten später auf der Pressekonferenz unterbrach Glasner dann einen Journalisten, der ihm eine keineswegs provokante Frage nach der Handlungsschnelligkeit stellte. ""Ich lasse mich heute nicht provozieren. Das war schon vorher beim Interview so"", sagte er, nachdem er schon betont hatte, dass Ostern ein ""Friedensfest"" ist: ""Ich wünsche euch allen frohe Ostern. Feiert mit euren Familien."" Dann stand er auf.\nBegonnen hatte Glasner jenes Statement mit den Worten, er sei ""weiter ganz entspannt"". Dass er genau das eben nicht ist, war in den 90 Minuten zuvor am Spielfeldrand deutlich zu erkennen. Der Coach schimpfte, brüllte, gestikulierte. Und als das Spiel abgepfiffen wurde, saß er für eine ganze Weile regungslos auf der Bank und starrte ins Leere.\nRode beklagt fehlende Konstanz im Saisonendspurt\nDas direkte Duell in Leverkusen hatte am Samstag die gegensätzliche Entwicklung beider Teams auf die Spitze getrieben. Ganze sechs Spieltage ist es her, dass die Eintracht scheinbar komfortable elf Punkte Vorsprung auf Bayer hatte. Doch während die Hessen seitdem nur drei Zähler ohne Sieg holten, waren es bei Leverkusen deren 16 ohne Niederlage. Wodurch die Werkself nun tatsächlich schon an Frankfurt vorbeizog. Und Rang sechs eroberte, der am Saisonende zur Teilnahme an der Europa League berechtigen würde. Die die Eintracht im Vorjahr gewonnen hatte. Und die Bayer als letzter Bundesligist im Viertelfinale nun gewinnen will.\n""Es ist ärgerlich, das Ganze so verspielt zu haben"", sagte Kapitän Sebastian Rode. Er schöpfte ausgerechnet aus der eigenen Negativ-Erfahrung Optimismus. ""Wie oft hatten wir in den vergangenen Jahre gute Positionen einige Spieltage vor Schluss und haben es nicht über die Ziellinie gerettet?"", fragte er: ""Jetzt gilt es zu hoffen, zu kämpfen und zu arbeiten, dass wir diesmal am Ende da stehen, wo wir stehen wollen.""\nTrainer Alonso lobt ""Dynamik""\nAbgerechnet werde zum Schluss, sagte auch Sportvorstand Markus Krösche floskelnd. Er stellte gleichzeitig aber klar: ""Wir werden jetzt keine Zielsetzung verändern."" Die hieß zwar nie offiziell Champions League, das hatte Krösche zuletzt nochmal klargestellt. Aber sie hieß sehr wohl: Erreichen des internationalen Wettbewerbs. Und in dieser Hinsicht musste auch Krösche feststellen: ""Es ist ein Rückschlag.""\nBeschwichtigend klang das Ganze auch bei Bayer, aber aus einer ganz anderen Blickrichtung. Dass nach sieben Pflichtspielen in Folge - einem eingestellten Vereinsrekord aus dem Jahr 2002 - plötzlich sogar die Champions League greifbar nahe ist, ""hätte im Winter niemand gedacht"", wie Amine Adli erklärte. Der Franzose hatte das 1:0 erzielt. Moussa Diaby (34.), wie Adli nach Vorlage von Wirtz, sowie Sardar Azmoun per Konter (90.+5) nach dem Anschlusstreffer durch Djibril Sow (75.) sorgten für den verdienten Sieg.\n""Es ist super, dass wir mit dieser guten Dynamik weitermachen konnten"", sagte Trainer Xabi Alonso, der das Team nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten bestens im Griff hat und auch während des Spiels scheinbar immer die richtige taktische Maßnahme parat hat. ""Aber wir schauen nicht auf die Tabelle. Wir müssen ruhig bleiben."" Dann drehte er sich lächelnd zu Pressesprecherin Valeska Homburg um und fragte lächelnd: ""Wie sagt man auf Deutsch? Fuß auf dem Boden?""\nVergleichsportal\nGutscheine für Sport-Shops\n\n\n© G+J Medien GmbH\nZugang zu allen STERN PLUS-Inhalten und Artikeln aus dem Print-Magazin\nwerbefrei & jederzeit kündbar\nBereits registriert?'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Manchmal müssen formschwache Spieler nur die richtige Rolle im Mannschaftsgefüge finden, um aufzublühen. So geschehen zuletzt bei Dortmunds Raphael Guerreiro: Seit BVB-Trainer Edin Terzic den Portugiesen aus der linken Verteidigerposition ins zentrale Mittelfeld gezogen hat, macht dieser vor allem offensiv auf sich aufmerksam.\nNachdem Guerreiro zu Beginn des Monats gegen RB Leipzig (2:1) noch auf der Bank geschmort hatte, drehte er im Revierderby beim FC Schalke 04 (2:2) sowie beim Kantersieg gegen den 1. FC Köln (6:1) auf. Zwei Treffer und drei Vorlagen verzeichnete der 29-Jährige in diesen beiden Bundesliga-Partien, für seine Leistung gegen Schalke wurde er in FUT sogar ins TOTW 20 aufgenommen.\nFolgerichtig hat sich Guerreiro bei der Wahl zum Spieler des Monats (POTM) März der Bundesliga gegen Jeremie Frimpong, Exequiel Palacios (beide Bayer 04 Leverkusen), Omar Marmoush (VfL Wolfsburg), Marius Bülter (FC Schalke 04) und Erhan Masovic (VfL Bochum) durchgesetzt. Viele Fans hatten sich aufgrund des Ausblicks auf enormes Tempo eher Frimpong gewünscht, Guerreiros POTM-Karte hat aber ebenfalls ihre Stärken.\nUnter den Grundattributen stechen das Dribbling (93) und der Pass (92) hervor, einzig die Physis (70) verhindert eine Aufnahme in die sogenannte ""Gullit Gang"" - eine Gruppe von Spielern, deren sechs Hauptwerte in FUT allesamt mindestens 80 Punkte betragen. Beim genaueren Blick auf die Spezialkarte wissen vornehmlich die Beweglichkeit (96), die Balance (96) und die Kurzpässe (94) zu überzeugen.\nGuerreiros POTM-Objekt ist in FUT 23 noch bis zum 6. Mai über den Abschluss einer SBC freizuschalten. Erforderlich sind hierfür zwei Teams mit Gesamtbewertungen von mindestens 83 respektive 84, außerdem werden mindestens ein TOTW-Spieler und ein Bundesliga-Profi benötigt. Laut Futbin kostet die günstigste Lösung der SBC knapp 56.000 Münzen (Stand: 7. April).\nIm Vergleich zu besagter letzter TOTW-Karte hat EA SPORTS zuvorderst die Physis (+8) stark verbessert. Die Defensive (+3) hat trotz des Releases als zentraler Mittelfeldspieler (ZM) das zweithöchste Upgrade erhalten. Die Gesamtbewertung beträgt 89 Punkte, zu den großen Highlights zählt das POTM-Objekt Guerreiros zu diesem fortgeschrittenen Zeitpunkt der FUT-Saison nicht mehr.\nBemerkenswert ist die Tatsache, dass der Wahlsieg des Europameisters von 2016 der dritte POTM-Triumph des BVB in Folge ist. In den ersten beiden Monaten des Jahres hatte sich jeweils Julian Brandt durchgesetzt. Der letzte Spieler des Monats der Bundesliga, der nicht bei Borussia Dortmund unter Vertrag steht, war Serge Gnabry vom FC Bayern München im November 2022.\nDurch seine jüngsten Glanzauftritte hat sich Guerreiro neben der POTM-Wahl auch die Wiederaufnahme der Thematik einer Vertragsverlängerung beim BVB verdient. Galt der Portugiese lange Zeit als Kandidat für einen ablösefreien Abgang im Sommer, so hat Dortmunds Sportdirektor Sebastian Kehl eine Ausweitung der Zusammenarbeit zuletzt nicht ausgeschlossen.\nNiklas Aßfalg\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de
"{'content': 'Jeremie Frimpong hat noch bis 2025 Vertrag in Leverkusen\nBayer Leverkusen hat mit der Verpflichtung des brasilianischen Neu-Nationalspielers Arthur (20) von América Mineiro vorgesorgt – für den Fall des Abgangs von Rechtsverteidiger Jeremie Frimpong (22) im Sommer.\nDer Niederländer spielt eine Super-Saison. Seine Bilanz: Acht Tore und fünf Vorlagen in der  Bundesliga für  Leverkusen. Seine Leistungen machen Frimpong zu einem der international meist begehrtesten Profis.\nBei Bayer Leverkusens 3:0 auf Schalke erzielte Florian Wirtz nach 413 Tagen wieder ein Tor in der Bundesliga.\nLeverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso hat Bayer von Platz 17 auf 7 geführt, holte in 18 Spielen 35 Punkte.\nManchester United will Frimpong holen. Das Interesse besteht seit Monaten.\nAber United bekommt offenbar Konkurrenz: Laut Transfer-Experte Fabrizio Romano sollen auch der  FC Bayern und der FC Barcelona Gespräche mit Frimpongs Berater Jeffrey Lemmert geführt haben. Demnach wollen die Bayern bis Mai abwarten, wie es mit ManCity-Leihgabe João Cancelo (28) weitergeht.\nNach BILD-Informationen ist an den Gerüchten nichts dran. Bayern hat keine Gespräche geführt und Frimpong nicht auf der Liste. Mit vier Rechtsverteidigern sehen sich die Münchner ausreichend besetzt.\n\nBarça gedemütigt! DIESER Real-Konter ist ein Meisterwerk\nDen Bayern ist die Kaufoption (70 Millionen Euro) viel zu hoch. Sie würden die Summe für Tuchel-Liebling Cancelo gerne drücken. Sport-Vorstand Hasan Salihamidzic (46) sagte nach dem Pokal-Aus gegen den SC Freiburg (1:2): „Wir werden uns natürlich hinsetzen und schauen, was wir auf dem Transfermarkt machen.“\n\nFrimpong soll klar zu Manchester tendieren. Grund: Er liebt die Stadt. Im Alter von sieben Jahren zogen seine Eltern mit ihm von Amsterdam nach Manchester. Als er neun Jahre alt war, spielte Jeremie in einem kleinen Verein und wurde von ManCity bei einem Turnier entdeckt. Bei City wurde er ausgebildet, wechselte 2019 aus der U23 zu Celtic Glasgow, ehe Leverkusen das Talent im Januar 2021 für 11 Millionen Euro kaufte.\n\nJeremie Frimpong (l.) im Duell mit Bayern-Verteidiger Matthijs de Ligt\nIn diesem Sommer kann Frimpong es sich fast aussuchen, zu welchem Top-Klub er flitzt: Er wurde in dieser Saison mit 36 km/h „geblitzt“ – fünftschnellster Spieler der Liga. Für Bayer liegt laut SPORT BILD die Schmerzgrenze bei 50 Millionen Euro Ablöse.\n„Erst mal hat er noch bis 2025 bei uns Vertrag, das ist eine gute Situation“, sagte Leverkusens Sport-Boss Simon Rolfes (41) zuletzt nach dem 3:0 auf Schalke über Frimpong, „für Jeremie gilt, was für alle unsere jungen Spieler gilt: Sie haben alle noch nicht ihr Potenzial bis zum Ende ausgereift. Da sind wir dann gefordert, sie zu entwickeln. Und Jeremie ist dafür ein schönes Beispiel: Die Schnelligkeit hatte er schon vorher, aber er hat sich im Spiel mit Ball, wie er seine Mitspieler einsetzt und Tore vorbereitet in den letzten zweieinhalb Jahren enorm verbessert.“\nBILD Gutscheine\nBILD Vergleich\nPartnerangebote'}",Jeremie Frimpong,de

Dem Vernehmen nach gab es bereits erste Gespräche zwischen Manchester United und dem Spieler-Lager. Wie nun bekannt wurde, mischt auch der FC Bayern in dem Transferpoker mit.\nWie der Transfer-Insider Fabrizio Romano berichtet, stehen auch die Münchner in Kontakt zu den Beratern von Frimpong. Demnach könnte der niederländische Nationalspieler die Nachfolge von Joao Cancelo an der Isar antreten, sollte dieser den Rekordmeister nach seiner Leihe im Sommer wieder verlassen.

"{'content': 'Der FC Bayern München interessiert sich nach Informationen von Transferexperte Fabrizio Romano für Rechtsverteidiger Jeremie Frimpong von Ligakonkurrent Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Es soll bereits ein Treffen mit Jeffrey Lemmert, dem Berater des 22-Jährigen, gegeben haben.\nNeben den Bayern sei zudem der spanische Top-Klub FC Barcelona im Rennen um Frimpong dabei. Dieser steht bei Leverkusen noch bis 2025 unter Vertrag, könnte den Klub aber im Sommer für eine hohe Ablösesumme verlassen.\n\nSky-Reporter Marlon Irlbacher schätzte die Lage zuletzt so ein: „Ich kann mir gut vorstellen, dass Leverkusen um die 40 Millionen Euro fordern wird. Ich glaube nicht, dass ihn Leverkusen halten kann. Ich höre, dass ihn die Bosse für einen entsprechenden Preis auch verkaufen würden.“\n\nSchon vor den neuen Infos von Romano galt Premier-League-Klub Manchester United als Interessent von Frimpong. Auch Romano bestätigt dies. Die Red Devils hätten den Spieler bereits seit Oktober auf dem Zettel.\nBevor ein Wechsel von Frimpong zum FC Bayern aber möglich wäre, müsste Klarheit in der Personalie João Cancelo herrschen. Die Leihgabe von Manchester City spielt ebenfalls auf der Position Frimpongs. Der deutsche Rekordmeister könnte den Spieler zwar fest verpflichten, allerdings nur für eine hohe Ablösesumme (im Raum stehen 70 Millionen Euro).\n\nEs ist unwahrscheinlich, dass die Bayern Cancelo für eine solch große Summe im Sommer verpflichten. Auch deswegen, weil sich der Portugiese noch nicht in der Startelf des Bundesligisten festspielen konnte.\n\nLaut Romano wollen die Münchener im Mai über eine mögliche Verpflichtung von Cancelo entscheiden. Nachdem dies getan wurde, könnte Frimpong ein heißes Thema werden.\nAuf ersten Blick nicht sinnvoll, auf zweitem schon finde ich\nPavard will langfristig nicht rv spielen.\nCancelo verlässt Bayern eventuell wieder.\nBleibt nur noch Mazraoui als rv, der auch mal als LV für Davies spielen könnte. Wäre also ne ganz gute Rotation zwischen Davies, Mazraoui und Frimpong und evtl.

Frimpong muss das erst mal machen. Außerdem ist Frimpong meiner Meinung nach noch unsicherer im Passspiel/ nicht so ruhig am Ball wie Mazroaui\ndeine argumentation stimmt schon, ist aber aufjedenfall dem erfahrungs- unterschied geschuldet. mazraoui stamm ajax, nationalteam, wm+ afcon, CL+ & 3 Jahre älter als Frimpong.. trotzdem sehe ich in Frimpong vorallem offensiv einige parallelen zu davies, vorallem den riesen sprung den auch davies von einer saison in die nächste hingelegt hat\nDavies wechselt im Sommer ✌\nWäre ein unfassbarer Fehler, wenn Lev ihn für 40 Mio abgeben würde. Frimpong\'s Leistung, Vertragssituation und Zahlungsfähigkeit der Interessenten sprechen eher für 60 bis 70 Mio imo.\nHätte ich jetzt auch als Wolf/Meunier Ersatz gesehen, aber Dortmund braucht das Geld sicher für weitere Spieler die weder auf der 6 noch auf der 8 oder der 10 performen.\nDortmund spielt 4er Kette.\n\nFRIMPONG spielt 3er Kette und ist durchgehend vorne.\nDas eine schließt das andere ja nicht aus! System kann ja angepasst werden, wenn man passendes Personal hat \U0001fae1\nDoch tut es weil der bvb aktuell nur 3 IVs besitzt von denen immer mindestens einer verletzt ist.\n\nNatürlich schließt sich das aus.\n\nMeine Güte, ist es zu viel verlangt mal 5 Sekunden zu denken bevor man schreibt\nAha...du bist wohl ein ganz schlauer? Es geht ja um die nächste Saison. Und da kann man auch zusätzlich einen Innenverteigiger verpflichten! Aber das waren auch nur Gedankenspiele. Also sei leise!\nGenau weil die bestimmt ihr System umstellen werden nach der geilen Saison dieses Jahr.\nWie man das so macht wenn man Erfolg hat ne ?\n\nAußerdem muss der bvb dann 2 IVs holen weil man langsam mal jemanden für mats Hummels holen muss.\n\nAber ich bin jetzt leise weil Gedankenspiele sind ja nur die erlaubt\nHolt Brazzo... der hat nach der Saison Zeit... dann könnt ihr immer weiter machen...\nIch würde diesen Transfer niemals verstehen. Mit Mazroui, Stanisic und notfalls Pavard ist da mMn Bayern gut besetzt, selbst wenn Cancelo nicht bleibt. My two cents\nErgänzung: wenn alle Stricke reißen, kann da auch Kimmich spielen und Gravenberch im Mittelfeld. Frimpong tu dir das nicht an. Bayern will einfach nur offensichtlich die Konkurrenz schwächen\nLeverkusen zu schwächen hat beim fc Bayern allerhöchste prio, deswegen muss man da unbedingt 40 mio reinbuttern\nKannst du nicht verstehen? Bayern spielt sehr oft 5er Kette und da brauch man einen top schienenspieler. Genau dieses Profil erfüllt Frimpong und hat noch Potenzial nach oben.\n@Ciaomon\n\nKlar, weil Leverkusen auch diese Saison wieder so stark war oder ?\n\nMan wurden die den Bayern gefährlich dieses Saison. Man man man waren die gefährlich\nNa salty Bayern fans, wie lief es denn im DFB Pokal? Tuchel hat bei Chelsea ganz anders gespielt\nNa salty leverkusen fan? Wie lief es denn in der liga, im pokal und international? Ach im pokal gegen elversberg in der ersten runde ausgeschieden? In der Liga nicht auf den internationalen plätzen? International schon raus?\nBevor ich Leverkusen Fan werde Hau ich mir ne Axt ins Bein\nBesser is\nLeverkusen ist doch international noch nicht raus 😁\nSchon wieder hängen sich die Bayern - natürlich verspätet - an einen der interessantesten Bundesliga-Spieler an. Ich denke aber dass Frimpong den Lockrufen und dem Geld seines niederländischen Trainers Erik ten Hag folgen und nach Manchester United wechseln wird. By the way: Mit Frimpong würden die Bayern wieder nur einen Spieler verpflichten, auf dessen Position kein wirklicher Bedarf besteht. Gravenberch und Mane lassen grüßen.\nIch hoffe das der BVB da auch mal sein Interesse hinterlegt! Da würde ein Frimpong sehr hilfreich sein.\nWürde mich freuen wenn er in der Bundesliga bleibt\nEin guter Rechtsverteidiger mit Offensivdrang.\nLinks Davies Rechts Frimpong\nDie Linienrichter ->😥😵\u200d💫\nSauber Umut\nDie Linienrichter müssen doch aber nur so schnell laufen wie die (letzten) Abwehrspieler.\nMit welcher Geschwindigkeit jemand ins Abseits läuft ist denen doch egal ^^\nJens Jeremies Frimpong\nDer floppt so hart egal ob es bei Bayern oder Man u ist\nScheiß di aus und kimm\nPasst perfekt ins Bayernsystem und ich sehe ihn lieber bei Bayern glänzen als am Ende in England wie Dreck behandelt zu werden oder generell warum auch immer unterzugehen.\nWas wäre das bayernsystem denn atm?\n@BuckFitches Tuchel liebt 3 er Kette und das ist Bayern am etablieren und Rechts passt Frimpong dann perfekt rein für die nächste Saison.\nOkay, wollt nur fragen, hab iwie das Gefühl es wird wieder vermehrt das alte 4231 gespielt werden unter Tuchel\nAber ja er kann Ubd mag auch die 5er Kette, aber was wird dann mit Coman? Der macht es ja nahezu optimal auf der Position\nStanisic hat wohl keine Zukunft?\nReicht halt nicht\nDer junge wird seinen Weg gehen. Selbst bei Bayern macht er seine Sache immer sehr gewissenhaft und vor allem defensiv stabil. Das ist aber halt das ""Problem"" und auch der Grund warum Bayern Frimpong will. In 95% aller Saisonspiele wird von Bayern erwartet, dass sie das Spiel machen. Da stellst du heutzutage keinen defensiv stabilen AV mehr auf, der nach vorne aber nicht viel mitbringt, sondern gehst auf möglichst schnelle und Offensivstarke Schienenspieler.\nDanke dir :)\nMan braucht nen defensiv stabilen AV sonst kriegst du auf höchstem Niveau auf den Sack. Asymmetrisch mit einem offensiven und einem inversen bzw. defensiven AV. Hat Bayern immer so gespielt, spielt City, spielt Real etc.\nDeswegen sagte ich 95% aller Spiele.\nFinde ich einen absoluten Safe call für Bayern. Alter plus Ablöse sprechen sehr für ihn und gegen Cancelo. Dazu hätte man noch deutlich mehr Budget bei der Verpflichtung eines Stürmers.\nDie 40 Mio werde es aber nicht. Denke am Ende wird er für 60-70 gehen.\nHast schon Recht, wobei man auch davon ausgehen kann dass cancelo günstiger zu haben wäre.\nFrimpong > Cancelo\nFußballerisch (noch) nicht. Aber vom Potenzial und vor allem Alter her mag was dran sein.\nZurzeit schon👍\n40 Mio sind schon ein richtiger Schnapper für den.\nBitte Jermie, tue mir das nicht an und geh ins Ausland😭\nDavies und Frimpong dürften dann regelmäßig geblitzt werden\nBitte nicht 😦\n\nIch will ihn nicht in der BL sehen, wenn er schon uns verlassen sollte. Würde für Bayern aber absolut Sinn machen. Dürfte aber nicht viel günstiger werden als Cancelo!\nBin großer Frimpong Fan. Aber man hat schon Mazraoui, Pavard und Cancelo auch wenn letztere vielleicht wechseln kann. Sehe den Bedarf jetzt nicht so\nGanz anderer Spielertyp, vor allem als Pavard. Wenn Tuchel langfristig Dreierkette spielen will, perfekte Ergänzung mit Startelfpotenzial. Bei Viererkette bin ich allerdings bei dir.\nDas interessiert doch die Bayern nicht wen die alles haben 😅\n@Lovinator Wenn man 3 er Kette spielen will hat man trotzdem Mazraoui und Coman, die das können\nBitte nicht\nBayern könnte Frimpong gut gebrauchen\nEig nicht\nEig doch\nWäre ein überflüssiger Transfer\nWürde Sinn ergeben. Davies-Pendant auf der rechten Seite.\nNein würde es nicht.\nMazraoui ist genau der selbe typ\nWäre einfach keine wirkliche Verstärkung.\nKlar, für das Dreierketten System perfekt und verstärkt den Kader in der Breite mit Potenzial für die Spitze.\nGut, dann müssten sie halt wirklich auf 3er Kette gehen. Muss man dann erstmal sehen.\nBei Viererkette bin ich bei dir, da sehe ich den Bedarf auch nicht. Kann mir nur vorstellen das Tuchel langfristig auf Dreierkette geht.\ndie kaufen die Liga kaputt!!!\nIst doch schön wenn er der Bundesliga erhalten bleibt. Bayern wäre mir lieber als Barca oder England\n@Rosa die Rolle hat der BVB seit ein paar Jahren inne 😉\nErsnua schnel\nRA für Gnabry, der im Sommer nach England geht\nDas ist ein viel zu großer Schritt, der würde bei Bayern nicht einmal in den Kader kommen #fürdieu23\nDer Mann wäre sofort bester Schienenspieler wenn sich die 3er Kette etabliert. Ist zwar nur ein Tick besser als mazroui aber auf jeden Fall besser\nDer Kerl ist einfach nur Bombenstark, der wäre sofort gesetzt. Finde gerade sein Zug nach vorne und genial.

Der Leverkusener, der aufgrund seiner Leistungsexplosion längst in den Notizbüchern größerer Klubs vermerkt ist, ist der einzige Bundesliga-Profi in der ESM-Topelf für den März.\nNeben der aktuellen Nummer 1 im deutschen Tor Marc-André ter Stegen (FC Barcelona), der als einziger Akteur aus Spanien die LaLiga-Fahne hochhält, dominieren Profis aus England und die Italien die Auswahl. Allen voran sind es Spieler von Manchester City und der SSC Neapel, die mit starken Leistungen aufwarteten.\nFür Napoli schlug vor allem der starke Auftritt in der Champions League gegen Frankfurt im Achtelfinal-Rückspiel zu Buche (3:0), gleiches gilt für Erling Haaland, der mit einem Fünferpack gegen Leipzig einen Sahnetag erwischte. Und den FC Arsenal vertreten Martin Ödegaard und Bukayo Saka, die mit den Gunners in der Premier League weiter auf Titelkurs liegen.

"{'content': 'Ediciones:\nFutbol/champions-league\nAnalizamos, números en mano, a las duplas más potentes de Europa. Elegir la mejor es cosa tuya\nErling Haaland y Kevin de Bruyne evidenciaron su gran entendimiento, por enésima vez esta temporada, en la goleada sobre el Arsenal (4-1). El Manchester City presume de contar con la \'pareja de moda\' en Europa. Su \'sociedad ilimitada\' ha lanzado a los de Guardiola a por el triplete, pero hay otras duplas que aspiran a conquistar esa \'corona\'. En MARCA las ponemos todas sobre la mesa. ¿Y tú de quién eres?\nMucho se ha hablado de la (tirante) relación entre Messi y Mbappé. Más aún después de que Francia ganara a Argentina en la final del Mundial. ""Hay mucho respeto entre ellos. Tienen una actitud ejemplar después de los partidos"", destacó Galtier.\nSobre el \'verde\', sin embargo, se entienden de maravilla. Kylian y Leo son la pareja, dentro de las cinco grandes Ligas, que más goles ha \'fabricado\' en común: 13. No es una sociedad, todo hay que decirlo, muy equitativa. Messi le ha \'regalado\' 10 goles a Mbappé mientras que Kylian \'sólo\' le ha dado tres a Leo.\nEl binomio del City \'atemoriza\' a Europa. Haaland y De Bruyne han puesto la directa hacia el triplete (Liga, Copa y Champions) y tienen el cruce de semis contra el Madrid en la \'mirilla\'.""Tienen una conexión especial y se nota. Cuando Kevin tiene el balón, Erling sabe que puede correr y el balón le llegará"", remarca Guardiola.\nSu entendimiento se traduce en números. El noruego y el belga han producido 10 goles de forma conjunta en Premier. Lo normal es ver a \'KDB\' asistiendo a Haaland. Así ha sucedido hasta en ocho ocasiones. Ante el Arsenal, sin embargo, se cambiaron los papeles. Fue Erling quien le dio dos pases de gol a \'Tintín\'. ""De Bruyne es el mejor centrocampista del mundo. Su sociedad con Haaland ha elevado su juego a una nueva dimensión"", apunta Kolo Touré.\nNadie contaba con ellos... pero el georgiano y el nigeriano están a punto de guiar al Nápoles a su primer \'Scudetto\' 33 años después de Maradona.""Con \'Kvara\' sentí empatía desde el primer momento. Es muy bueno, pero también es un buen chico. Eso también importa"", señala \'Super-mhen\'.\nOsimhen (21) y Kvaratskhelia (10) lideran, respectivamente, la carrera por los títulos de \'Capocannonieri\' y máximo asistente de la Serie A. Entre ambos han producido ocho goles. Seis han \'nacido\' de asistencias del georgiano y dos de pases del nigeriano.\nXabi Alonso cuenta con la banda derecha más \'eléctrica\' de Europa. Su ubicación sobre la \'pizarra\' es curiosa. A menudo el carrilero/lateral (Frimpong) ocupa posiciones medias más adelantadas que el teórico mediapunta/extremo (Diaby). El excanterano del PSG tiene querencia a meterse hacia el medio y eso libera la banda para el neerlandés.\nTienen algo en común. Son dos de los jugadores más rápidos de la Bundesliga. Ambos figuran en el \'top 10\'. Diaby ocupa la tercera posición con una velocidad punta de 36,52 km/h y Frimpong es quinto, con 36 km/h. Su registro de asistencias está, más o menos, equilibrado: cinco de Diaby a Frimpong y tres en el sentido opuesto.\nUna sociedad que no vive su mejor momento. Y es que Mourinho ha retirado a Abraham su condición de titular indiscutible. Belotti le está \'arañando\' minutos en las últimas semanas al ex del Chelsea.\nDybala, en cambio, sigue a su \'bola\'. La \'Joya\' está completando un temporadón: sus 16 goles y ocho asistencias entre todas las competiciones han guiado a la Roma a las semis de la Europa League y a pelear por la Champions \'vía Serie A\'. Ambos, en cualquier caso, \'casan\' bien. Dybala le ha dado tres goles a Abraham y el inglés le ha \'servido tres tantos en bandeja\' al argentino.\nEl argentino y el brasileño han reeditado esporádicamente en París el gran entendimiento que exhibieron en Barcelona. Lo han hecho, eso sí, a \'cuentagotas\', cuando las interminables lesiones de \'Ney\' se lo han permitido. ""No hemos podido jugar juntos todos los partidos, pero creo que el vínculo que hemos ido creando es muy bueno, puesto que la relación entre nosotros es maravillosa"", advertía Neymar en la \'CNN\'.\nLos ex del Barcelona han forjado seis dianas conjuntamente esta temporada en Ligue 1. Messi le ha dado el doble de goles a Neymar (4) que el brasileño al argentino (2). Veremos si vuelven a jugar juntos... en París.\nBuena parte del liderato del Arsenal en Premier se ha cimentado, en gran medida, sobre la producción anotadora de sus extremos. Especialmente en ausencia del lesionado Gabriel Jesus. ""Es una pesadilla jugar contra Martinelli. Es una amenaza constante"", asegura Mikel Arteta. Más de lo mismo sucede con Saka.\nLa balanza de su relación está un tanto desequilibrada. Cinco de los seis goles que han \'producido\' en común han salido de las botas de Saka. El Arsenal necesitará la mejor versión de ambos para poder pelearle la Premier al City hasta el final.\nLa \'simbiosis\' de \'El dúo de la oscuridad\', como se apodan, está fuera de toda duda. Karim y Vini han fabricado 41 goles en común desde que el brasileño recaló en el Real Madrid en 2018.\nEn LaLiga 2022-23, sin embargo, no han evidenciado ese entendimiento. Apenas han conectado en cuatro goles, tres llevan la firma de Benzema y uno de Vinicius. Fuera de LaLiga sí que han mostrado su sinergia. Entre Champions, Copa, Mundial de Clubes y Supercopa de Europa se han \'inventado\' 10 goles. Vini (7) es, generalmente, el que hace las veces de asistente. Benzema le ha servido en bandeja tres dianas.\nEl Barcelona va lanzado a ganar LaLiga, pero ha echado mucho de menos al lesionado Dembélé en el tramo final de la temporada. Lewandowski, por su parte, lidera la lucha por el \'pichichi\' con 18 dianas sin haber completado un curso extraordinario. No le ha hecho falta tampoco.\n""Dembélé es el jugador que más me ha sorprendido del Barça"", reconoce el polaco, que ha notado como sus cifras se resentían en ausencia del extremo francés y de Pedri. En total comparten cuatro goles en común en el marco de LaLiga. Dembélé ha asistido en dos tantos a Lewandowski, los mismos que le ha dado \'Lewy\' a Ousmane.\nGriezmann se ha erigido, especialmente tras el Mundial, en el \'MVP\' del Atlético y en uno de los mejores jugadores de LaLiga. El ex de la Real Sociedad y Barcelona está muy por encima, a nivel de rendimiento, del resto de sus compañeros.\nSi nos ceñimos a las estadísticas, su mejor socio es Álvaro Morata. Es con el que más goles (4) ha producido en común. Tres dianas le ha dado Griezmann a Morata. En el sentido contrario sólo ha llegado una. ""Antoine es fundamental para nosotros dentro y fuera del campo"", admite Álvaro.\nPenaldu\nValverde y Yabusele, los más temibles\nLot87\nMuy buenos Vinicius y Benzema, y normal la avalancha de amor madridista en este diario, pero porqué es tan difícil opinar con objetividad ?\n© Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

"{'content': 'Este jueves concluyeron las series de cuartos de final de la UEFA Europa League 2022-23 y, en consecuencia, ya se conocen los cuatro clasificados a semifinales: Juventus, que eliminó a Sporting de Lisboa; Sevilla, que dejó en el camino a Manchester United; Bayer Leverkusen, que venció a Union Saint Gilloise; y Roma, que hizo lo propio ante Feyenoord. El único equipo español en carrera pero a la vez el más ganador del certamen deberá jugar ante la Vecchia Signora de Matías Soulé, Ángel Di María y Matías Soulé; mientras que en el otro duelo se enfrentarán el conjunto en el que milita Paulo Dybala contra el de Exequiel Palacios.\nEl máximo ganador de la historia de la competencia fue demasiado para un elenco inglés dormido que no logró hacer pie en el estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán en ningún momento. El resultado global terminó 5 a 2 luego de un 2 a 2 en Inglaterra (goles de Marcel Sabitzer para los Diablos Rojos y de Harry Maguire y Tyrell Malacia en contra para los Nervionenses) y un contundente 3 a 0 para el equipo local en España (dos tantos de Youssef En-Nesyri y uno de Loic Badé). Así, el conjunto dirigido por José Luis Mendilibar aspirará a meterse en su séptima final de Europa League con una particularidad: ganó las seis que disputó.\nPor otro lado, a la Vecchia Signora le alcanzó un empate 1 a 1 en el Allianz Stadium (anotaciones de Adrien Rabiot para el elenco italiano y de Marcus Edwards para el combinado portugués) para sentenciar la serie 2 a 1 ante el conjunto portugués luego del 1 a 0 como visitante en el encuentro de ida (gol de Frederico Gatti). De esta manera, los dirigidos por Massimiliano Allegri buscan su cuarto título luego de los conseguidos en las temporadas 1976-77, 1989-90 y 1992-93.\nBayer Leverkusen se deshizo con facilidad de Union Saint Gilloise de Bélgica luego de un 5-2 en el global. En el partido de ida disputado en el estadio BayArena de Alemania, igualaron 1 a 1 con tantos de Florian Wirtz para el local y de Victor Boniface para el visitante. En el duelo de vuelta, el equipo dirigido por Xabi Alonso se hizo fuerte de visitante y ganó 4 a 1 con tantos de Jeremie Frimpong, Mitchel Bakker, Moussa Diaby y Adam Hlozek (Casper Terho descontó para los belgas). Busca la segunda copa (levantó el trofeo en la edición de 1987-88).\nEl último equipo en clasificarse a semifinales fue la Loba, que necesitó del tiempo suplementario para eliminar a la única institución de Países Bajos que quedaba en competencia. La serie finalizó 4 a 2 para los dirigidos por José Mourinho, que sueña con levantar su segundo título continental consecutivo (en la última temporada ganó la Conference League). Paulo Dybala convirtió un gol agónico a los 89′ y le dio a su equipo la posibilidad de disputar el tiempo extra, donde fue mucho más que su rival y lo derrotó 4 a 1.\n🤯 𝙎𝙀𝙈𝙄𝙁𝙄𝙉𝘼𝙇𝙄𝙎𝙏𝘼𝙎 🤯🧡❤ @ASRomaEspanol⚫️🔴 @bayer04_es ⚪⚫ @juventusfces🤍❤ @SevillaFC#UEL pic.twitter.com/d4PpNm3Sdw\nLos partidos de ida de cada una de las series se disputarán el 11 de mayo, mientras que los de vuelta se jugarán el 18. Como en las dos anteriores, en esta etapa no se tienen en cuenta los goles convertidos de visitante para desempatar sino que se desarrolla un tiempo suplementario y, luego, en caso de ser necesario, una definición por penales. En resumen, quien anote más goles a lo largo de los dos partidos, se meterá en la definición por el título.\nCopyright 2023 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados'}",Jeremie Frimpong,es
"{'content': 'De esta forma, el Sevilla se medirá ante la Juventus, mientras que la Roma se enfrentará al Bayer Leverkusen por las semifinales de la Europa League.\nEl Sevilla FC venció (3-0) este jueves al Manchester United en la vuelta de cuartos de final de la Liga Europa celebrada en un eufórico y lleno Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán, un paso más en la leyenda del seis veces campeón de la competición, que se medirá por un puesto en su séptima final con la Juventus.\nEl cuadro español se comió al inglés con el ambiente en Nervión y con la puesta en escena de juego, compromiso y gol. Un error de Maguire propició el 1-0 de En Nesyri a los ocho minutos mientras que Badé dobló la renta al poco de la reanudación, en un remate con el hombro que tocó el larguero y se coló en la red de David de Gea. El meta español regaló también el tercero al marroquí, superados los ingleses desde el aviso que les dejó Old Trafford.\nEl United, con hasta cinco bajas en su habitual once, fue engullido por la mística continental de un Sevilla que hace suya esta Liga Europa, como en el tramo final en Mánchester para hacer un 2-2 de la nada. José Luis Mendilibar, en el banquillo andaluz desde hace un mes, ha dado las armas para resucitar a un equipo que muerde arriba, aprovecha sus ocasiones y es fuerte atrás.\nEl cuadro local, espoleado por el ambiente de las grandes noches, lanzó la presión y recogió sus frutos ante Maguire. El internacional inglés se vio rodeado y En Nesyri aprovechó el mano a mano con De Gea (1-0). El equipo de Ten Hag tardó 20 minutos en volver en sí, con buenas carreras de Antony y pocas de Sancho para paliar la ausencia de un cerebro como Bruno Fernandez, pero sin remate.\nPese a la lesión de Marcao, el Sevilla supo mandar y defenderse cuando tocó, para llegar a hacer el 2-0 antes del descanso. El duelo se volvió, con ese tanto de Ocampos que fue anulado por milímetros, en un ida y vuelta que volvió a encender al Pizjuán. El equipo de ‘Mendi’ tenía la sartén por el mango y lució pegada a los dos minutos de la segunda parte con el remate de Badé.\nEn un saque de esquina de un Rakitic mariscal durante todo el encuentro, el defensor francés firmó un remate parabólico con el hombro que hizo enloquecer al Pizjuán (2-0). Ten Hag había metido ya al ‘tocado’ Rashford tras el paso por vestuarios, pero la empresa inglesa se antojaba imposible por juego y sensaciones.\n‘Mendi’ quería más control, pero el corazón iba por su cuenta en un Sevilla que no dejó de apretar y buscar el tercero. Weghorst fue la otra opción de Ten Hag, pero los locales eclipsaron a un United con mucha menos fe. La defensa ‘red devil’ la sacó en boca de gol, Navas frenó a Rashford y, en otro arreón, llegó el 3-0 de En Nesyri tras un grave error de De Gea a 10 minutos del final.\nLa Juventus, otro grande que tendrá que pasar por el Pizjuán, se puede dar por avisada. El Sevilla, en un año de penurias, no renuncia a su leyenda. El efecto Mendilibar se ve en competición doméstica, saliendo finalmente de la zona baja, y en la Liga Europa recupera el club su mejor versión, favorito a un séptimo título.\n\nCrédito: SportsCenter\nEl Sporting de Portugal y el Juventus de Turín empataron este jueves (1-1) en Lisboa en el partido de vuelta de los cuartos de la Liga Europa de fútbol, por lo que el triunfo por 1-0 en la ida garantizó a la “Vecchia Signora” el pase a la siguiente ronda de la competición.\nDespués de que el Oporto y el Benfica cayeran a manos del Inter de Milán en la Liga de Campeones y de que el Braga fuera eliminado por el Fiorentina en la Liga de Conferencia, ahora le tocó al Sporting caer ante un cauteloso Juventus, que sufrió para eliminar a los portugueses.\nEn Lisboa, el partido se decantó mayoritariamente hacia los locales, con momentos de intensa presión, pero sin hacer mella en los de Massimiano Allegri, bien organizados defensivamente y sin duda felices tras haber recuperado temporalmente los 15 puntos que les fueron retirados en la Serie A.\nLos “leones”, alentados por la mayor afluencia de público a su estadio esta temporada, arrancaron bien el partido, pero no tardó en caer un balde de agua helada sobre la capital portuguesa gracias al gol del Juventus en el minuto 9.\nTras un córner, el titubeo de los defensas del Sporting creó una oportunidad para que Rabiot marcara el tanto inicial del partido y aumentara el grado de dificultad para los lusos.\nEl gol del francés permitió a Massimiliano Allegri poner a su Juve a hacer lo que mejor sabe, bajar sus líneas para conservar la ventaja, pero la rapidez del inglés Marcus Edwards obligó al experimentado técnico a replantearse su estrategia.\nEn un momento del partido en el que el Sporting presionaba más, Edwards corrió por la banda derecha de forma supersónica y asistió a Trincão, que envió el balón al poste.\nLa jugada continuó con el uruguayo Manuel Ugarte, una de las grandes figuras de la primera parte, que al llegar al rechace fue placado por Rabiot en el área, lo que llevó a Edwards, aún a mil por hora, al punto de penalti, desde donde empató a los 20.\nLa “Vechia Signora”, acampada en su campo, realizó pocas visitas a la portería defendida por el madrileño Antonio Adán, pero las que efectuó causaron cierto peligro, debido a alguna desconexión defensiva del equipo verdiblanco.\nEl mayor quebradero de cabeza para los turineses fue Ugarte, omnipresente en el campo y una auténtica pesadilla para Chiesa o Di María, al igual que el japonés Morita, que repitió su brillante actuación en Italia.\nPero fue en una pérdida de Morita cuando el Juventus estuvo cerca del segundo, que no llegó porque el centro de Juan Cuadrado fue demasiado rápido y raso para que Vlahovic, solo ante la portería, lo rematase bien.\nComo en el partido de ida, el Sporting tuvo algunos problemas de definición. A ello no ayudó un muro juventino compuesto por dos viejos conocidos, los brasileños Alex Sandro y Danilo, que vistieron la camiseta del Oporto durante muchos años.\nA medida que el cronómetro avanzaba, el Juventus recurrió a las lecciones más arraigadas del “Calcio” para estar con un pie en semifinales, aunque no con la misma cohesión de antaño.\nUn ejemplo de ello fue la distracción de Danilo, que dejó al lateral Esgaio solo delante de Szczesny y con el empate en sus pies, pero éste disparó demasiado fuerte.\nMientras los turineses echaron mano de su experiencia, los lisboetas fueron a por todas e incluso Sebastián Coates se sumó al ataque.\nEl veterano central uruguayo fue el que más cerca estuvo del gol en los últimos instantes -y en todo el partido-, y sus fallos sumieron en la desesperación a los aficionados verdiblancos.\nEl Sporting se despidió de la Europa League con la sensación de que podía haber hecho más, después de que dos errores en los dos partidos le pasaran factura.\nA su vez, el pragmatismo y la experiencia del Juventus le bastaron para seguir en la competición y para poder dar un vuelco a su inusual temporada.\nCrédito: ESPN\nPaulo Dybala resucitó este jueves al Roma con un tanto fundamental en los últimos compases que alargó el partido hasta la prórroga, en la que guió a los suyos a la victoria ante el Feyenoord (4-1, 4-2 global) y a las semifinales de la Liga Europa de fútbol, en las que se medirá al Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nPaulo Dybala volvió a ser la pieza clave del Roma. No hay mucho más misterio en la noche europea del jueves en la capital italiana. El Roma parecía muerto, desahuciado con el tanto de Paixao, pero revivió de la mano de un Dybala que, a medio gas, tocado todavía de la lesión que sufrió en la ida, volvió a conducir al éxito a los de Mourinho.\nSufrió el conjunto ‘giallorroso’ sin su estrella en la primera mitad. El Roma empezó motivado, intenso, acompañado por un Estadio Olímpico lleno, incluida la parte visitante por la prohibición de entrada a los aficionados neerlandeses, que intimidó en los primeros instantes, pero falto de lucidez en los metros finales. La que pone siempre Dybala.\nY es que muy consciente de la importante baja de su rival, el Feyenoord en defensa fue un cerrojo. Juntó la línea de defensa y la del centro del campo y complicó sobremanera el tránsito por el carril central, obligando a los de Mourinho a lanzar el largo constantemente, un remedio que apenas surtió efecto.\nSolo la calidad de Spinazzola por la izquierda generaba espacios que luego el propio carrilero desestimaba con centros desacertados. Matic exhibió su calidad en acciones defensivas todo el partido, imperial minimizando al máximo los ataques rivales.\nEl efecto estadio fue desapareciendo a medida que el Feyenoord fue asentándose. Un disparo de Cristante que rozó el palo, una contra mal gestionada entre Belotti y Pellegrini y un disparo de El Shaarawy fueron lo más destacado en ataque de una ‘Loba’ que, además de verse incapaz en metros finales, sufrió la lesión de Wijnaldum.\nA todo esto, el Feyenoord llevó el partido a su terreno. Pérdidas de tiempo desde el minuto 1, faltas para cortar el ritmo y tanganas para sacar de quicio a los italianos surtieron el efecto deseado. No se jugaba con regularidad.\nLos neerlandeses fueron creciendo paulatinamente basándose en esa solidez defensiva y a raíz de la ocasión más clara del partido. Una gran combinación en el centro del campo que acabó con un centro que remató potente Szymanski directo a puerta, justo al sitio en el que estaba un Rui Patricio que se encontró el balón y lo desechó a bocajarro.\nEl segundo acto comenzó igual que el primero, con un arreón de los locales que desembocó en remate al palo de Pellegrini. El estadio empezó a creer y tras una respuesta neerlandesa, llegó el ansiado gol romanista. Spinazzola, clave en el éxito de este equipo, remachó un balón suelto e incendió, más todavía, el partido.\nLas piernas de los jugadores del Feyenoord empezaron a temblar. Las de los del Roma volvieron a estar frescas. El conjunto de Róterdam empezó a desconfiar, a tener dudas de la que había sido hasta el momento una salida de balón perfecta que derivó en una imprecisa. El gol lo cambió todo.\nLa entrada de Dybala fue un plus añadido que volcó el choque aún más hacia la meta defendida por Bijlow. Incluso Cristante puso el 2-0 en el marcador, pero el colegiado anuló el tanto por una falta previa clara de Abraham.\nPero lo que parecía ir en una dirección cambió radicalemente con la lesión de Smalling, líder absoluto de la zaga ‘giallorossa’. Sin él, el Roma fue más débil atrás. Y el Feyenoord sacó el máximo rédito posible cuando estaba contra las cuerdas. Paixao remató libre de marca y anotó el empate a uno. Se hizo el silencio en el Olímpico.\nEl problema del Feyenoord fue el mismo que el otros tantos equipos que pasan por la capital italiana. Tiene nombre y apellidos. Es Paulo Dybala. La ‘Joya’ no falla en los momentos grandes desde su llegada a Roma. Un buen control dentro del área le bastó para hacer sangre, para reenganchar a la afición y para llevar el partido a la prórroga.\nPasó de todo en el tiempo suplementario. La tuvo el Feyenoord clarísima en botas de Giménez. Dybala asustó con una recaída, visiblemente molesto, pero se recuperó para poner un córner a la cabeza de Ibáñez que acabó en la madera. El partido se rompió ante el desgaste físico, y entre idas y venidas llegó la sentencia. Pellegrini encontró a Abraham en el área y el ariete hizo lo propio con El Shaarawy.\nPero no se quedó ahí el encuentro. Otra vez Dybala fue la fórmula de la felicidad. Pase de oro a Abraham que el ariete estrella en el meta pero cuyo rechace recogió Pellegrini para poner el 4-1 definitivo con suspense por la revisión del VAR.\nEl Roma es Dybala y diez más. El campeón del mundo llevó a los suyos a las semifinales, en las que se medirá al Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nCrédito: ESPN\nUn arranque contundente ante un rival inexperto condicionado por la presión facilitó la victoria en Bruselas (1-4) del Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso, que se situó en las semifinales de la Liga Europa y acabó con el equipo revelación del Viejo Continente, que, cuando recuperó el desparpajo y quiso reaccionar, ya tenía la clasificación muy cuesta arriba.\nEl Union St. Gilloise belga ha sido la sensación de la Liga Europa. Sin bagaje en este tipo de competición estuvo a un paso de situarse entre los cuatro mejores del torneo. Afrontó la cita como local con un buen marcador obtenido en el choque de ida, empate a un tanto que complicaba la tarea del Leverkusen.\nPero el equipo germano impuso su ley desde el principio. Refuerza a Xabi Alonso la situación del Bayer. Cuando el preparador español llegó al BayArena el equipo estaba en descenso en la Bundesliga y con un pie fuera de la Liga de Campeones. Ahora, meses después, el cuadro de Leverkusen está en la parte alta de la clasificación alemana y es aspirante al título de la Liga Europa, a la que llegó como tercero de su grupo en la ‘Champions’ y dejó fuera al Atlético Madrid.\nEl conjunto de Xabi ya lleva doce partidos sin perder. Empezó a fraguar la victoria a los dos minutos, en una acción que nació en una conducción de Florian Witz que terminó con un balón dividido entre Adam Hlozek y el defensa Senne Lynen que acabó en los pies de Moussa Diaby, que superó al meta Anthony Moris.\nEl equipo de Karel Geraerts ni siquiera había asimilado la situación y Jeremie Frimpong pudo hacer el segundo a los veinte minutos. Pero llegó a siete del descanso, en una transición que inició Diaby, que centró al checo Adam Hlozek y culminó el neerlandés Mitchel Bakker.\nTras el descanso el encuentro se desató. Marcó el tercero que sentenció el choque Jeremie Frimpong, vivo ante el error garrafal del portero Moris ante la presión de Bakker.\nFue entonces, con todo perdido, cuando despertó el St. Gilloise. Acortó distancias enseguida, cinco minutos después, en el 65, en una estupenda jugada por la izquierda, robo incluido, de Loic Lapoussin que terminó con un centro al área que recogió el finlandés Casper Terho, que amagó, tiró y marcó.\nDespués pudo hacer el segundo Victor Boniface de cabeza y a continuación Simon Adingra tiró a un palo. Pudieron ser el segundo y el St. Gilloise, a la desesperada, reengancharse al duelo. Pero fue al contrario.\nA diez minutos del cierre un tiro de Diaby que rechazó el portero Anthony Moris fue recogido y aprovechado por el checo Adam Hlozek, que hizo el cuarto, hundió del todo al representante de Bélgica y llevó a semifinales al Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nAvenida Italia 850, Providencia, Santiago. \n+56 9 6919 6517 info@elmostrador.cl'}",Jeremie Frimpong,es

Tampoco se le escapa a nadie que la situación económica no es la ideal para acometer una operación costosa. En ese contexto hay que situar la noticia que este martes han publicado diferentes webs especializadas en el mercado de fichajes: Trent John Alexander-Arnold, lateral derecho inglés de 24 años que juega en el Liverpool, es un objetivo del club azulgrana. Xavi Hernández habría pedido, según estas informaciones, un esfuerzo a la dirección deportiva para ficharle. Al mismo tiempo, también ha trascendido que el Real Madrid es otro de los grandes clubs que pretenden al internacional inglés.\nDeportivamente, el asunto encaja. Alexander-Arnold, considerado uno de los mejores laterales diestros del mundo, se ha estancado esta temporada en el Liverpool y ha perdido protagonismo en la selección de Inglaterra hasta el punto de que su paso por el Mundial de Qatar fue anecdótico (33 minutos como suplente en un único partido). No vería con malos ojos un cambio de aires para relanzar su carrera.\nVinicius y Alexander-Arnold\nCrack indudable en el apartado ofensivo, especialistas en asistencias por su gran toque de balón, tiene despistes defensivos y lagunas tácticas. Pero en el fútbol ofensivo que Xavi quiere mejorar, tendría sitio. Sergi Roberto no es un lateral puro y no tiene regularidad por las lesiones, a Koundé no le gusta jugar de '2' y reciclar a Araujo, que vale para todo y no se queja, debilita el eje de la zaga. De todos los nombres que suenan, el de Alexander-Arnold es el que más cautiva por encima de los de\xa0Benjamin Pavard (Bayern),\xa0Diogo alot (Manchester United), Juan Foyth (Villarreal),\xa0Joao Cancelo (Manchester City/Bayern), Josip Juranović (Unión Berlín) y\xa0Jeremie Frimpong (Bayer Leverkusen).\nPero en lo económico cuesta creer que el Barça pueda entrar en una puja por Alexander-Arnold, que acaba contrato en 2025 y está valorado en unos 80 millones de euros. El Real Madrid, que ya piensa en un relevo para Dani Carvajal que no será el recambio habitual de Lucas Vázquez, se encuentra en la misma situación. Deportivamente interesa, pero económicamente es caro.\nPese a ese escenario común, TeamTalk informa del interés del Barça por el jugador del Liverpool, Fichajes.net añade que el Real Madrid se suma a la pelea por él y Calciomercato publica que el 'Clásico' en los despachos por Alexander-Arnold ya ha comenzado.

Folarin Balogun is currently on loan, while Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Joe Willock have been prominent squad players in recent years.\nBut with Arsenal doing so well this season, it would seem as the Gunners have actually outgrown some of their younger prospects – and now perhaps their most exciting starlet is set to leave the club.\n\nAccording to the Athletic\'s (opens in new tab) David Ornstein (opens in new tab), Charlie Patino is set to depart this summer in search of first-team football.

"{'content': 'When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n\nArsenal may repeat their Sol Campbell masterstroke in the transfer market this summer, according to reports\nArsenal are planning an audacious move to sign a new leader from another London club this summer.\nThe Gunners have led the table for 93 per cent of the season (opens in new tab) – yet following the capitulation away at Manchester City in the week, look set to lose out on the title after all. City are now ahead of the Gunners in the table with a game in hand and may have to drop points in three of their last six fixtures to hand Arsenal the league.\nSome have blamed the lack of leadership and experience on such a ""bottling"" – something that Mikel Arteta looks set to address this summer.\n\nAccording to The Sun (opens in new tab), Arsenal are chasing Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi to address the issues in their defence. The Gunners have fallen apart at the back since losing the hugely influential William Saliba to a back injury, conceding more goals from set pieces. In bringing the 22-year-old Eagle north of the river, the Gunners could well address their problems – while evoking memories of another notable transfer.\nIn 2001, the Gunners signed Sol Campbell on a free transfer from their bitterest foes, Tottenham Hotspur. Though Guehi would not be seen as nearly as incendiary a deal, the principles of the deal would be similar.\nCampbell was signed at a time where the majority of the rest of the Arsenal defence was set, just as it is now. The Gunners were bringing a player who had captained another London club in the Premier League not just for his physical traits but for his leadership abilities and organisational nous at the back, offering him Champions League football and a crack at the title – not unlike what they could offer Guehi now.\nCampbell facilitated a move to a much more athletic defence for Arsene Wenger, while Guehi could do the same for Arteta, eventually replacing Gabriel next to Saliba at the back.\n\nThough it\'s early days with the rumour, Palace would likely look for £50 million for Guehi, who has captained them since joining at the start of last season. Whether Arsenal would spend that much on a sixth central defender remains to be seen, with defensive midfield and another forward still the priority.\nThe former Chelsea man is valued at €35m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).\nArsenal are already being linked with a host of big names ahead of a summer back in the Champions League.\nMason Mount is an option in midfield, with\xa0Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic\xa0and\xa0Bayer Leverkusen\'s Moussa Diaby\xa0rumoured in the attack.

"{'content': 'Arsenal Have Not Underwhelmed, They Have Overachieved This Season by Patrick S\nAt the start of the season, Arsenal were dismissed as top four contenders. Most football experts in all media outlets in England were utterly dismissive of Arsenal’s top 4 prospects. In August 2022 for example, out of the 23 BBC Sport football pundits, only 8 thought Arsenal would finish in the top 4 and none of those thought Arsenal would finish higher than 4th!\nWatch Arteta after Etihad defeat – “Man City deserved to win” “They are an exceptional team…..”\n\nCALLING ALL ARSENAL FANS! Anyone who would like to contribute an Article or Video opinion piece on JustArsenal, please contact us through this link…\nYes. We have achieved our target which is top 4. But wasn’t it the same target for last season? It’s taken is 2 seasons to achieve the target for 1 season. I would rather say we were “HIGH FLYING” this season rather than “over achieving”. And guess what. “HIGH FLYING” will hardly fill the pages of history.\nCapitulating last season’s ending as well as this season’s ending due to THE SAME ISSUES shows there are still serious problems not resolved\nLast season target was to qualify for any European Cup, not Champions league precisely\nNo it was not. Arteta himself said he wanted Arsenal back in the C L inside 3 years,  which was last season.\nHe did, but the task was bigger than most people thought.\nOverachiever\nFunny, a Leicester team from no where won the league, it’s about finishing the story, that Leicester team would have come second and be remembered as a wonderful season for the size of the club but they saw the opportunity and grabbed it, this opportunity will not come around every season, many clubs were having a terrible season we were fantastic and created a healthy enough lead that should be able to see us through the line but failed, in few years time this could be remembered as a squandered opportunity.\nOur best performance against city has come from the Fa cup and on that night we had Trossart,Vieira,Tierney,Nkettiah rob holding all starting while city had their full squad but we played so well that city managed a one nil Victory, what I saw that night was a team set up to man mark city players all over the pitch AnD they struggled to the extend gadiola had to change tactics in the game, the point was the team had what they needed to cross the line but was let down by the manager tactically and squad management skills, last year we experienced same lost 3 in a row went to Stanford bridge with a back 3 and got the win\nAt this point of the season, it’s not about principles, it’s not about dominant football, it’s about 3 points this is called the business end of the season when everyone is fighting, city didn’t do much against Fulham yesterday other than grab the points, it’s not about trying a flirk, skills or showing that you are the best team, it’s about going out there and bringing the points by any means thats what it’s all about at this time of the season if that has been in our managers mind we would not have lost all these points we recently dropped from a position of strength\nIt was Arsenals to lose. But naivety crept in.\nWe play same style as city, only thing is they are better at it. So when meeting them, change tactics to defensive and counter attacks,  but the manager thought we could match them boy  to man.  Leading two against West Ham and continue to play as if the game is still nil/nil.\nI would say the manager could have done better with game management. He failed the test\nHis only win against city was in an fa cup we just played on the counter and won, that’s what I admire about Madrid they play in any way that gives them the W at the end of the day history only remembers the winners.. There is nothing wrong in knowing ur teams weakness and playing to their strength, if the players available have shown they can’t play the way you want then play to their strength, till everyone is back every team is looking to exploit opposition weaknesses\nYou are right. History only remembers the winner. History could have remembered us as 2022/2023 PL champions and not we top the table for most weeks.\nAre we into the CL to be eliminated and fall back to Europa league? I would still prefer the PL trophy.\nYou are right Gun down.\nPoor game management.  It’s all about points not style. If you are leading 2 up. Change tactics immediately and use defensive plus counter attacks.\nYou are absolutely right.\nArsenal made a formidable start to the season. We took the lead in the table. When the league resumed after the WC break, everybody was concernbed about how we would cope, when starting up again, and we would be without Jesus.\nAgain we stood up to the pressure, and just kept going.\nIt is because the progress is built on a solid foundation laid over the past couple of years, and there is every chance, we can do well again in the coming years.\nYes, more can be expected next season from the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea. But, every season is always the same. Some “big” teams will underperform, also next year.\nWe are, where we are in our own right and not because others have faltered.\nArsenal behind the league champion since 2017.:\n2016/2017 #1 Chelsea, Arsenal #5, 18 points behind.\n2017/2018 #1 Man.City, Arsenal #6, 37 points behind.\n2018/2019 #1 Man.City, Arsenal #5, 28 points behind.\n2019/2020 #1 Liverpool, Arsenal #8, 43 points behind.\n2020/2021 #1 Man.City, Arsenal #8, 25 points behind\nThere’s no doubt that we have almost closed the gap, and I believe our progression will continue next season 🔴⚪️\nSorry, I forgot the 2021/2022 season.\n#1 Man.City, Arsenal #5, 24 points behind.\nThere is no divine right that we wouldn’t fall 20+ points behind the winner next time or win it, ask Liverpool, it’s hard to predict the future the one the that we should be worried about is how we trow the top 4 away last season and proberbly learned nothing this season by proberbly trowing away the title again in similar fashion…\nWell, I don’t believe we will be 20+ points behind next season. We have a young team with potential to get better, and I’m sure we will recruit more quality players next summer. Liverpool have and old team and haven’t been clever enough with their recruitments lately.\nWe are not throwing away anything but have to realise that other clubs are stronger. Man.City has still a much better squad than us, but we are getting closer.\nPersonally I don’t like deficit mentality, man city been better than us is not the reason we are failing, tell me the difference between the way we are failing now and what happened last season, it’s almost similar fashion when the team needed help the manager failed them, do you believe that even next season we will be better than season?\nThat’s a question I want you to sincerely answer… If we Lose the title please it has nothing to do with the quality of city it’s purely of our own making.. I understand that people want to remain positive but let’s be realistic why we are failing short and tackle our own demons\nI never thought we were going to win the league this season, which I have said many times.\nWhy do Man.City win the league year after year and reach the semifinal or the final of CL almost every year. Man.City is probably the best team of the world and they bought the best striker in the world to make them better, and he has already made 50 goals for them this season.\nThere’s a reason why we haven’t won the league since 2004. The main reason is that other teams are better than us like it or not. Yes, I believe that we will be a top team next season as well, what we have will be better next season.\nLast season we finished the season with 69 points, now we have 75 and still five games left.\nWell it’s your opinion and some valid point there too…\nOne can also argue that it’s not always about the players maybe city have the best manager in the world also, who make everything tik, personally I believe if gadiola managed our squad this season we would have won the league, everyone has been complaining about city’s spending the truth is others like united and Chelsea have spent equally as much.\nFootball every season is different with it’s challenges that we finished 1 point below city doesn’t mean next season we win the league, doesn’t even guarantee next season city will be the best team… Liverpool pushed city for season’s look at them this season, they can win it this season, I don’t like predicting the future, we can prepare our best but others will equally prepare, these closed gap doesn’t mean we are automatically disposed others as title contenders\nYou can look at it in many direction.\nEven if we have our best recruitment next season city will still probably have the better squad, this season what happened last season that ended our top4 hope repeated again, if city win the league eventually, how does that have to do with the quality of city?\nI believe we have a very good foundation and I’m optimistic about our future and this is my objective. Let’s finish the season before we are making any conclusions.\nHow can you say we have a good foundation and be optimistic?\nAccording to the “realists” on JA we have bottled it, our captain is not good enough, our players are overrated, we have no plan B, we have failed this season, every other manager is more experienced and has better tactics. In fact, there really is no hope because this season is over, MC are better, MU are better and next year we have no chance again because everyone else is going to be better. It’s been a terrible season and the future’s bleak.\nI hope we get the two English players Ornstein’s touting. They’re best of mates and look to be in need of “a new challenge”, or whatever they call it these days.\nArteta is still learning on the job, and has almost completed his best season, and will get better, and the team along with him.\nWe’ll challenge again. This season has been quite a ride.\nNice saying Jax 👍\nYes. But the second place isn’t guaranteed yet, because we still have to play against Chelsea/ Newcastle/ Brighton and we will have two more games after that\nAnd one of those games after that is Nottingham Forest who beat Liverpool the other day and drew with Man City previously, walloped Brighton last week. Their lowly position doesn’t seem to matter when they’re at home.\nThey will put in extra efforts if they still have a good chance to stay in EPL\nLiverpool beat Forest 3-2\nOn the 22 October Forest beat Liverpool at home 1-0.  It’s their home form I was talking about.\nYes we have over achieved from what we have done the previous seasons where we  have underachieved. Like last season we have finished higher than the season before but also like last season, we have failed to take a opportunity. 4th last season was ours and we threw it away. 1st this season was ours and we threw it away. Now i hear some people say, dont get gready!!!!! Well i am not gready just a little worried about the soft under belly that still exists. There are reasons why we have capitulated this season and it was not due to injuries ( all though they dont help ) it was due to the way we cant sustain our form under pressure. Our set up is flimsy and the way the manager and players handle it is not very inspiring. Well done for second but lets not get all gushy.\nWhy are we saying overachieving, please let’s be realistic\nA season that saw Chelsea and Liverpool spend most of their season mid table, a season that united are 3rd or 4th playing in two cup finals with a manager in his first season at united, a season that saw Newcastle probably ending in top 4, outside city and wobbling Liverpool with aging squad we and city are the most stable club currently, mind u even in the mist of all these we are probably ending trophyless, knocked out at both cups at earliest possible, just made it past the Europa group stage and sent home… The truth is if city were to win the league then it’s a big missed opportunity, I can’t see many top clubs dropping this low next season\nTake a look at the whole picture and tell me where arsenal would have finished and be see as progress, below united and Newcastle who finished last season below us and who have managers that is less than two years and one year with their clubs respectively.\nArsenal title challenge this season is not over. Chelsea is next.\nOur dip at a crucial time was a combination of factors IMHO.\n1. Lack of proper rotation. No need to reshuffle starting 11, start 2 or 3 different players while starting one’s in form.\n2. Injuries to key players at critical times.\n3. Not dropping players out of form\n4. No plan B or change in approach or play when the team is clearly struggling.\n5. Players can’t dig themselves out of a crisis, and our leaders aren’t leading when the team falters.\nStill a lot of work to be done next year. The mental aspect still an issue, and a plan B when things go sideways.\nCan’t approach every game with the same tactics, even Pep and Klopp change things up when needed.\nYes, we haven’t closed the tremendous gap but it’s definitely decreasing. We are lacking squad depth and haven’t the best squad either, but we are moving in the right direction.\nWell DP, there are plenty who will disagree that we haven’t got squad depth.  I don’t think we have squad depth or sufficient quality from those who are fit.  It is overlooked that Tomi has a long term injury.\nIt is disappointing that some of our recent signings are looking less convincing.  Two off on loan and Vieira looking lightweight this season.\nAgreed with SOME of the signings Sue. Tavares, Lokonga both on loan and looking way below th4elevel we hoped they might reach Viera too looks totally unsuited to English physical game. Three poor signings.\n  You win with some signings, you lose with others and that is normal!!\nRight now  we lack squad depth  but by August it will be stronger surely!\nWell said @ Durand.\nTotal agreement with you.\nSquad depth is a myth!!!!! And a poor excuse. The last four games, the ONLY first team regular missing was Saliba. If we are that flimsy then we will never win anything. One player out does not allow squad depth to be a valid excuse. It is a poor excuse and not THE reason.\nI avoided saying this because I knew people will attack me, people saying injuries makes me laugh\nMaybe I will make an article about our struggles but maybe that too will be seen as a negative article\nIt probably will be (seen as negative), but a fully fit top-quality squad is obviously key to success over the whole season.\nThat’s your opinion and not mine. Do Guardiola share your opinion 😁\nNo Didrik, its fact, Saliba is the only first team player missing these last four games and we have had a healthy bench in all areas.\nUnlike you Reggie, I didn’t think Arsenal could go the whole season without a dip in form.\nSaliba has been one of Arsenal’s best players this season and among the league’s best centre-backs. His importance to the team is highlighted by how many goals Arsenal conceded on average before and after he was injured.\nI don’t think Saliba’s absence is the whole reason, but our defense has definitely become more vulnerable during his absence.\nYES IT HAS nobody is denying that. The problem is, are we so finely tuned that one little piece goes missing andxwe collapse? Or have we got no plan B, or are we so flimsy one piece missing, its good night irene. Because that has what has happened. The squad is still in good shape, the team not so.\nWe aren’t good enough and we have never achieved 90 points during a season. Man.City has achieved 90 points several times, and when you need 90 points+ to win the league you can’t make many mistakes. We have had a tremendous EPL season and has almost closed the 30 points gap between our clubs. I’m optimistic about our future and I believe we will get better next season. COYG\nDP, agree, but the problem for next season is that Liverpool and Chelsea can’t be as poor as they were this season, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Aston Villa are on an upward trend, with good managers and have owners willing and able to spend, while clubs like Tottenham Hotspurs, Brighton & Hove Albion, Brentford and Fulham will be more than nuisance value.\nNext season should be very competitive for the Champions League places and Arsenal will have the added demands of competing in Europe, plus hopefully greater attention to the domestic cups.\nThere could yet be a twist in this season, as City have two potential trip-ups for their final games. Unpredictable Brentford and wonderful BHA may be our saviours yet.\nIt’s not over as long as we do not drop any more points, but I’m sure the players are quite aware of this.\nAre you guys not tired of this?\nWe are out of all competition and wobbling, we keep predicting city have this, they play that and are in fa cup final and semi finals of the UCL, we play a game every week and look so jaded still..\nAgree GD, we are out of form and city are bang in form. Where do these people think this massive turn around is going to come. AND SAME PEOPLE SALIBA IS STILL OUT so your theories make no sense.\nWinning by stretching rules or using lawyers to find weaknesses in UEFA´s Financial Fair Play Regulations. Football has become a dirty business and Man.City should have been stopped long time ago.\nAgree DP, but money talks with football; you only have to look at the track record of the English FA and FIFA (look no further than the award of the World Cup to Qatar).\nAs for Manchester City,  a serial offender under FFP, financial penalties are a joke and just gift money to the governing bodies, while loss of points, relegations etc are a pipe dream.\nYaa your right it’s not over ,let win all the games and we see\nWhile we have improved from last season ,it will seem like a waste if we do not go on to win the league having been 8points clear ,also while we have improved other teams have been awful this season that won’t be the case next season and I feel we may have missed our chance if we come second .\nHalf a billion spent on players we should be seeing improvement anyway ,so to say we have overachieved is an overstatement IMO .\n8 pts clear with plenty of games to play against City was nothing! We all knew that they could win 10 on the bounce playing in third gear.\nAmazing job managing to get that lead in the first place. I’d be disappointed if another team caught us, but not City. Even an amazing Liverpool team over a 4/5 year period could only finish above City once.\nStraight to the point, good reading, Jen.\nBut you skirt over the fact we should have took 6-9 points from  3 games that we should have won (Liverpool being the exception) .you have to remember that city have their eyes on the big one and have been playing midweek also ,while we went out of EL against a really poor team so there was no excuse not to beat Southampton and West Ham IMO ,while it’s great we have put up a fight this season it also stinks of last season when we completely folded when top 4 was so easy to get .\nIf we finish second it will be on par with the bottle job from last season ,let’s see how long the owners put up with that after so much expenditure,he will get next season no doubt but there won’t be anywhere to hide from him or the excuses that arise so often reagarding his tenure here thus far .\nLet’s hope city take their eye off the ball and we somehow go on to take the title .\nDo you believe that Arsenal started the season and considered themselves title contenders? Did you expect Arsenal to play 38 league games without dip in form? I never expected us to win the league because we haven’t the best first eleven or squad. I felt sad in five minutes time, but realised that Arsenal can never compete with a shady club stretching UEFA’S Financial Fair Play Regulations. Football have become a dirty business and I hope Arsenal never will be like Man.City. COYG\nSo you clearly don’t except Arsenal are allowed one bad run of results? From your comments, it’s perfection or nothing else for the entire season with the youngest team in the league, that weren’t meant to be anywhere near the title.\n👍 Dan, draws, plus loss to Everton were critical.\nIt’s beyond me anyway that the tone has changed.\nWell pointed out that we have done so well to be where we are.\nThe minute there is a downturn Arteta is to blame.  Weak mentality. No rotation.   Bottlers and so on but excuses are made for every team who are below us for being out of sorts and who will be better than us next season. . This is a regular football season like all seasons  when anything can happen… except that at the moment our arch rivals right now have almost been in a class of their own for 4/5 years\nWell OFC Arteta is to blame just as Emery and Wenger before him were too ,I don’t get you’re point sue .\nYes we have improved but there was absolutely no excuse to lose so many points in the last 4 games ,I’ve been right behind Arteta and the team all season but I will call out this manager and team when I believe they have let us down ,which they have .\nWould be nice to get out of moderation Pat ,maybe blame old jonny boy for my outburst last weekend ,out of sort by me but had a bad week personally .\nBut I won’t stand crap from  him or anyone else .\nSorry Dan. You are both in moderation till 28th May. I can’t wake up to crap like that. I need a rest\nWell I come back on the 28th may then\nYes Dan, both of you can comment, but will have to wait for my approval before comment is posted…\nIt’s funny how you keep complaining that there’s no excuse for dropping so many points over the last 4 games (Arsenal’s only genuine bad run so far by the way), yet there’s no realisation and acknowledgement that Arteta had done a phenomenal job getting us into that position prior to the Liverpool game in the first place.\nFor some bizarre reason, you’re defining Arteta’s season on these 4 games and ignoring the insanely good job he did in the first 29 games.\nHe’s made mistakes for sure over the last few games, but it’s not his fault what Ramsdale doing what he did against Southampton, or Saka missing a crucial pen.\nStop being so negative all the time, and focus on the huge progression we’ve made.\nJen, we have progressed but we should have won it. I didn’t believe we could, until the day we LOST  1-3  at home to City. That might sound strange, but we only went down because two of our players gifted it to City on a plate. We were better than them initially in that game and that actually gave me confidence because I thought (maybe naively) that we would learn from those mistakes. Unfortunately we didn’t. We have no discipline at the back and sometimes in midfield. That title was there for the taking. The cup was screaming at us to take it home, but we ignored it.\nThe loss of concentration for those 3 games was hugely disappointing DK and virtually ensured the title would slip away from us as I couldn’t envisage us beating City after that\nIm just frustrated at the level of blame that has been bandied about after what has been a very good season so far.  Perhaps it’s my ever advancing years that allows me to be more able to take the rough with the smooth and not blow a fuse if the wheel falls off – hopefully temporarily in this case.\nOf course I want Arsenal to be numero uno.  I still think Arteta and the team are evolving but are clearly not at the level of PG and his players and the depth of talent that sits on the bench.\nWould Maureen have blown it from our position, NO. He would have parked the bus, played 12 in defence or done what he could to have ground out a draw at city. We didn’t even park our bike!!!!!\nWould he have gotten us to the lead in the first place. Not very likely!\nHis record says yes!!\nWhether you chose to accept it or not Arteta is the major reason we might not win the league this season and I bet his favoritism is causing problems behind the scenes.\nNonsense, Man.City is better than us and have been better than us for many years. In addition do they have a better first eleven and squad than us. How often has Arsenal achieved 90 points during a season? Whatever you think about Arteta, Man.City won both their games against us and will finish their season with more points than us. It’s sad that football is a game run by shady people.\nWe lost the league in the three games previous to the city game. City to us this season should have been irrelevant. We had it and blew it. Nothing to do with city.\nWe lost the league because one team is better than us and won both games against us. In addition are they able to achieve 90+ points year after year. We have almost closed the tremendous gap between our clubs, but to finish the league above Man.City, and all their famous lawyers are almost impossible.\nDidrik, it’s not impossible. It was extremely possible at one point this season. When we went 2-0 up at Anfield it looked very possible. It’s our own fault. If we had the defensive solidity of Newcastle we would have won the league….. and easily. Even a club like Newcastle for instance, haven’t got a solid defence because of money, it’s because their manager and his team coached their players to defend properly. We on the other hand were too helter-skelter at the back and sometimes in midfield. Too many unessary topsy-turvey performances against vastly inferior teams shows that we were not solid enough defensively.\nBoth games against city didnt matter, it was the points against the likes of Everton, Southampton and west ham, that lost us the league, the city game would have been a free hit.\nThe year Leicester won the league, they lost to the second team twice that season, US.\n👍Reggie, so near but no cigar.\n🙄\nSo no responsibility from Arteta for getting us into that amazing position in the first place then? We must have had a different manager up until the Liverpool game then!\nAgree Jen, one has to be evenhanded in assessing Mickel Arteta’s management, as he has got a lot right.\nDamn Arsenal supporters are negative\nSome Damn Arsenal supporters are too positive.\nOne can only be positive about this season because we’ve massively overachieved.\nImagine a team like QPR getting to an FA Cup final, but losing to a team like Liverpool or Utd in the final, then your own fans calling the players and manager out as bottlers. Disgusting!\nCant say ive seen those words.\nNo one can predict what will happen to underperforming big teams this season when it comes to next season because, Last season when we missed top 4, I remember we are all tipping many big teams to be contenders ahead of Us which will make it more harder for Arsenal this season to qualify for champions league. But what happened at last ? Who would have predicted such a bad season for Liverpool, Chelsea, even tottenham. we expect them to be contenders the way they finished last season. (Especially the way Chelsea splash out cash to buy players). But reverse is the case…. so in my opinion. Arsenal have gone beyond many expectations this season.  Therefore, No one can predict what will happen next season as well. All we should hope for is a smart transfer window and far better season for our beloved club next season.

But this came about when the Gunners uncharacteriscally stopped 9 points their last 4 matches.\n9 points dropped? NO! This is pathetic cave-in that came from the Gunners in their last 4 matches for Arsenal.\nDon’t they known that Arsenal winning the Epl title this season is at stake and not negotiable. But for them to have unceremoniously dropped 9 points to jeopardize Arsenal’s chance that was looking good enough to win the League this season is unbecoming of the Gunners individually and as a team.\nThis is a betray of professionalism that bothers on undermining and subversion which had come from the Gunners to recklessly gift Man City the title win this Season I have to say.\nFor as things stand now at the top of the table. Arsenal are no longer in control of this season’s Epl title win. But which hitato they were with some cushion to it.\nUs Arsenal can only hope now to see Man City drop up to 5 points in their remaining 6 games of the season.\nAnd Arsenal will capitalize to collect all their remaining15 points of the campaign to win the League.

Arteta\'s relationship with Guardiola has added intrigue to the rivalry, too, with the Basque working under the Catalan at City, later signing stars from his former employers.\nLast summer, Arsenal bought Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City – but now, Guardiola may be about to return the favour.\n\nSources have told Football Insider (opens in new tab) that Kieran Tierney is being eyed up by City, as the Eastlands outfit eye a natural left-back for their system.\nGuardiola was close to bringing Marc Cucurella to the Etihad last season, eventually losing out on the Spaniard to Chelsea. This was to replace Joao Cancelo at left-back with a natural left-footer, giving Jack Grealish the freedom to move inside while maintaining width with the system.\nThis term, Nathan Ake has fulfilled the role superbly but Tierney represents a fascinating option for City, given his underrated versatility.\nThe Scot has struggled with playing inverted for Arteta but was one of his most important players in previous seasons, despite injury troubles. Tierney can play as a centre-back in a back three – like he does for Scotland – or as a left-back in a back four. This would provide Guardiola with a profile similar to Kyle Walker on the opposite flank.\n\nAccording to the report, Tierney is privately valued at around £30 million by Arsenal. The Sun\xa0claims that the left-back is also wanted by Newcastle United.\nTierney is valued to be worth €25m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).\nWith\xa0Erling Haaland breaking goal records a-plenty, Pep Guardiola said that\xa0Manchester City are monitoring the striker\'s fitness ""24 hours a day"".\nIlkay Gundogan is rumoured to be a major target\xa0for Barcelona this summer, while\xa0Guardiola has explained why major City stars are being subbed early.

Pep Guardiola\'s side are two points behind with two games in hand – and will realistically have to lose three of their last seven fixtures to hand the title to Arsenal.\nDespite a stunning campaign, Mikel Arteta has the second-youngest squad in the league behind Southampton – and now may look to upgrade in several areas in order to cut the gap between his team and City.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe, yet to start a single game all season, has been earmarked for departure by Football365 (opens in new tab), with former Gunners manager Unai Emery and Aston Villa fans of the No.10.

Here’s how it works.\n\nArsenal will bring N\'Golo Kante in on a two-year deal from Chelsea, according to reports\nArsenal have offered N\'Golo Kante a two-year deal to keep the World Cup winner in London beyond his current Chelsea deal.\nThe Gunners were actually in for the Frenchman, not just when he left Leicester City, but when he played in France. Arsene Wenger had a contact at Paris-based Suresnes, who touted the midfielder to the then-Arsenal boss.\n""He played in a club in Paris,"" Wenger told SportBible (opens in new tab). ""One of my best friends is a director and he told me \'Please, I have a player who we know is unbelievable.

Kante has had a similar trajectory at Stamford Bridge, beginning life as a defensive foil and developing his game to become more of an attacking threat over the years.\n\nDespite the report from Spain, Kante\'s move to Arsenal is far from a done deal.

[It was] a new environment. Everything goes so much faster, sometimes training sessions felt like competitions. It\'s the European elite, you can\'t miss a moment. But I feel that getting used to it has been behind me for a while now.""\nGravenberch added that he had hoped to get more playing time this season, and that he expects his situation to change next term.\n""A year of training and playing at the top level is wonderful and instructive,"" he said.

Villarreal have tried since last year to convince Chukwueze to sign a new deal without success, so will consider offers this summer knowing that he will leave for free in 2024.\n11.21 BST: Manchester United and Manchester City are closely monitoring Napoli centre-back Kim Min-Jae, according to Calciomercato.\nKim, 26, has scored two goals in 40 appearances for Serie A leaders Napoli since joining the Italian outfit last summer from Fenerbahce in a €18m transfer.

However, the financial side of the deal remains difficult and LaLiga president Javier Tebas said last week Barca are not currently in a position to be able to afford to bring Messi back to the club.\n""I don\'t know, that is a question for the president of LaLiga, not for me,"" Xavi said on Tuesday when asked if he thought Tebas could help Barca because of the impact Messi\'s possible return could have on the Spanish league.\n""I think you\'ve asked the wrong person. It\'s a question for the president of LaLiga. It\'s not about help here, though. There are [financial] regulations which you have to comply with and that\'s it.""\nMessi, 35, is currently back in Barcelona, where he still has his family home, and on Monday was photographed having dinner with Barca players Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets in the city. Xavi joked he turned up for dessert, quickly adding that he had not spoken with Alba and Busquets about their reunion with Messi before turning the attention to Wednesday\'s game at Rayo Vallecano (stream LIVE at 4 p.m. ET on ESPN+ in the U.S.).\n""It\'s a hypothesis and we are not thinking about it,"" he said of coaching Messi next season.

The Manchester United goalkeeper contributed more than most to the shock Europa League exit to Sevilla with two calamitous mistakes, but then on Sunday made crucial saves against Brighton & Hove Albion to help earn a place in the FA Cup final against Manchester City (stream live on ESPN+, US only, June 3).\nDe Gea is a good goalkeeper. You don\'t play more than 500 times for a club like United if you\'re not, but the question since Ten Hag took charge last summer has been; can he thrive in a system that demands he\'s as good with his feet as he is with his hands?\n- Dawson: Will United\'s De Gea dilemma force Ten Hag to sign a new keeper?\n08.30 BST: The Daily Star reports that Liverpool want to sign Kalvin Phillips from Manchester City to bolster their midfield.\nPhillips, 27, joined City from Leeds United last summer, but he has struggled to win a place in the team -- partly down to fitness issues.\nWith no Premier League starts to his name at the Etihad, Phillips could look to move on to increase his playing time. Liverpool see the England international as a good alternative after being priced out of a move for Jude Bellingham.\nLiverpool believe they could sign Phillips for £35m, after City had paid a transfer fee of £50m to Leeds.\n- Newcastle will consider allowing winger Allan Saint-Maximin to depart the club this summer with AC Milan interested, reports Football Insider. The 26-year-old has managed just one goal for the Magpies this season and the Premier League outfit will allow the Frenchman to leave if they receive a suitable bid in the summer. Several top clubs in Europe are thought to be monitoring the situation.\n- Chelsea are watching Internazionale goalkeeper Andre Onana, writes Ekrem Konur.

Chelsea are in the market for a new shot-stopper with inconsistent performances from Edouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n- Newcastle are braced for a summer of huge spending with Arsenal defender Kieran Tierney and Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby identified as targets, reports The Sun. The Magpies are prepared to spend up to £150 million in the summer as Eddie Howe assembles a squad to compete in the Champions League next season. The left-back and left-win positions have been identified as areas that need reinforcement, with Tierney and Diaby seen as good fits.\n- Victor Osimhen is close to agreeing a deal with Paris Saint-Germain, however the Napoli striker would prefer a move to the Premier League or Bundesliga, according to Foot Mercato. A move to England is the top priority of the Nigeria international, who has interest from Manchester United and Chelsea, while a move to Bayern Munich is also an acceptable club for the 24-year-old.\n- Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez has given the green light to sign Athletico Paranaense forward Vitor Roque, according to Sport. The Catalan club are desperate for a striker in the summer following a string of poor performances from Robert Lewandowski, with Roque at the top of their list. The report suggests Xavi likes the 18-year-old\'s style of play and the fact he offers a different option to Lewandowski, however the LaLiga giants face competition from Arsenal and Chelsea for the Brazilian\'s signature.'}",Moussa Diaby,en

Germany’s top four qualify for Europe’s premier competition.\nIt was a typical battling performance from Union, and one goal was enough to clinch the team’s 16th win of the season.\nUnion defender Jerome Roussillon lobbed a cross over the Gladbach defense and Becker allowed it to drop before meeting the ball with his right boot to send it inside the left post.\nUnion coach Urs Fischer took the exhausted Becker off with just under a quarter-hour remaining, giving the Suriname winger an affectionate hug and bringing a smile to his face with whatever he said in his ear.\nUnion next faces in-form Bayer Leverkusen in Köpenick on Saturday.\n“In the Bundesliga you get absolutely no presents,” Fischer said. “We’re on a good path, but nothing is settled yet.”\nLEVERKUSEN RUN CONTINUES\nLeverkusen is reaping the benefit of Xabi Alonso’s coaching.\nLeverkusen showed its resilient side with a 2-0 win over direct rival Leipzig, which dropped out of the top four.\nGoals from Adam Hlozek and a late penalty from Nadiem Amiri secured Leverkusen’s win and stretched its unbeaten run to 13 games across all competitions.\nIt’s been a remarkable turnaround.\nLeverkusen was second from bottom in the Bundesliga with just five points from the opening eight rounds when former Spain star Alonso was appointed coach in place of the fired Gerardo Seoane.\nLeipzig played well for long periods but found no answer to the home team’s resolute defending or ability to surge forward thanks to the speed of its attackers.\nHlozek scored five minutes before the break when Robert Andrich played a perfectly weighted through ball for Moussa Diaby to race onto on the right. Diaby whipped in a cross behind Leipzig’s defenders for the incoming Hlozek to side-foot inside the left post.\nHlozek was playing in place of Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz, watching from the stands after complaining of stomach problems.\nTimo Werner, Dominik Szoboszlai and Christopher Nkunku all went close for Leipzig, which pushed hard for an equalizer until Szoboszlai conceded the penalty in the 85th for bringing down Jeremie Frimpong. Amiri duly sealed the result from the spot.\n“To win like (we did) today is not easy,“ Alonso said. “We’re not used to it. But our mentality and experience helped us. I’m very proud of the team.”\nLeverkusen hasn’t lost a game since a 3-2 defeat at home to Mainz on Feb. 19. On Thursday it reached the Europa League semifinals with a 4-1 win at Union Saint-Gilloise.\nEarlier, Freiburg strengthened its case for Champions League qualification with a 4-0 rout of relegation-threatened Schalke. Michael Gregoritsch scored twice for the home team to move fourth.\nLeverkusen is six points behind Freiburg.\nOn Saturday, Mainz defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 to give Borussia Dortmund the chance to take over as league leader. Dortmund took its chance,\n___\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nAnyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.

"{'content': 'Slick Sevilla punish slapdash Man United to ease into Europa semis\n\nEuropa League kings Sevilla breezed past Manchester United into the semi-finals of their favourite competition as Youssef En Nesyri scored twice in a dominant 3-0 win on Thursday that secured a 5-2 aggregate triumph.\nBoth En Nesyri\'s goals came from mistakes by United goalkeeper David de Gea while trying to play the ball with his feet and it was a listless and error-strewn performance by the English side.\nSevilla were relentless with their high pressing and United, who led the first leg 2-0 before conceding two late goals at Old Trafford, never threatened to get back into the game amid a raucous atmosphere at a sold-out Sanchez Pizjuan stadium.\n""I have never seen an atmosphere like this in my entire life,"" En Nesyri told Movistar Plus.\n""I am very happy for the two goals and for the fans who supported us until the end.\n""We have to stay together, with the fans, because that\'s how we\'ll go far.""\n\nLanguishing in the bottom half of LaLiga during a difficult season in which two managers have been fired, Sevilla rediscovered their mojo at Old Trafford to grab a late 2-2 draw.\nIt took only eight minutes for Sevilla to open the scoring after De Gea delivered a hospital pass to Harry Maguire who was challenged by Erik Lamela and En Nesyri scooped up the loose ball to net from close range.\nSevilla wasted several chances and Lucas Ocampos had a goal ruled out by VAR due to offside in the build-up shortly before halftime.\nUnited manager Erik ten Hag brought on Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw as halftime substitutes but straight after the interval Sevilla defender Loic Bade scored with a towering header from a corner which went in off the crossbar.\nEn Nesyri wrapped up the win in the 81st minute after United goalkeeper David De Gea failed to deal with a long ball over the top and the Morocco striker finished well to move the Spanish side closer to a record-extending seventh victory in the competition.\n""We have to do better, that\'s the demand,"" Ten Hag told BT Sport.\n""We were not composed, not calm. We didn\'t beat the press, when you do there are so many spaces behind, and it was obvious at the start how to do it.\n""We lost the battles, they had more passion, more desire, more willingness. This was a great opportunity, a great occasion, to win something and we gave it away - we have to blame ourselves. It\'s gone, we can\'t change it.""\nSevilla will face Juventus in the semi-finals.\nUnited play Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday.\nJuventus draw with Sporting to book Europa semi-final spot\n\nAn early goal by midfielder Adrien Rabiot earned Juventus a 1-1 draw with Sporting in an entertaining Europa League clash on Thursday to win their quarter-final 2-1 on aggregate and set up a semi-final clash with Sevilla.\nJuventus, who saw their 15-point deduction in Serie A over the club\'s transfer dealings scrapped earlier on Thursday pending a new trial, had earned a 1-0 victory in the first leg with a second-half goal by defender Federico Gatti.\nThey will meet Sevilla in the semi-finals, with the Italians at home first on May 11 before the return leg in Spain on May 18, after the Spanish side knocked out Manchester United 5-2 on aggregate.\n""We suffered, we did good things in the second half at the beginning, but we have to do better when it comes to our chances,"" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said.\n""We knew it would be difficult but we are bringing home a good result.\n""I expected Sevilla (in the semi-finals) to be honest. They are a tricky team... They have won so many Europa Leagues so they definitely have an advantage. The signs from the last game (in Manchester) were in their favour, I had that feeling.""\nJuventus took an early lead through Rabiot who netted from close range after nine minutes following a corner.\nSporting winger Marcus Edwards equalised from the penalty spot in the 20th minute when he sent Juve keeper Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way with a strike into the middle of the goal after Rabiot was penalised for a tackle on Manuel Ugarte.\nThe Lisbon side had hit the woodwork moments before.\nSporting came close to taking a surprise lead and levelling the tie in the 35th minute when defender Ousmane Diomande connected with a corner but his header narrowly missed the target.\nJust before halftime, Sporting winger Nuno Santos tried to square the ball inside the box coming from the left but Juve defender Gleison Bremer blocked the threat right in front of the diving Szczesny.\nAfter the break Sporting pressed with confidence for possession but they squandered three more opportunities to level the match.\nRuben Amorim\'s side should have found the net in the 75th minute when defender Ricardo Esgaio latched on to a pass on the edge of the box only to see his volley fly over the bar, while Sebastian Coates spurned two more chances minutes from time.\nSporting have now completed a run of five home European matches without a win for the first time in the club\'s history, having recorded two losses and two draws in their previous four.\nThey have lost each of their last seven ties with Italian clubs.\nRoma score twice in extra time to book Europa semi-final spot\n\nStephan El Shaarawy and Lorenzo Pellegrini scored in extra time to earn hosts AS Roma a spot in the Europa League semi-finals after defeating Dutch side Feyenoord 4-1 on Thursday for a 4-2 aggregate win.\nEl Shaarawy converted a cross from Tammy Abraham after 101 minutes and captain Pellegrini, who missed a penalty in last week\'s first leg, sealed the win seven minutes later when he slotted in a rebound from an Abraham shot.\nPortuguese manager Jose Mourinho was full of praise for his team after reaching his second European semi-final in a row with Roma, following last season\'s Conference League title.\n""Maybe someone thinks differently, but in my view, the team played very well in a difficult match to deal with,"" he told Sky Sport Italia.\n""I\'m sure the fans would have gone home happy for the team regardless of the result. We have limits, but this team is a family.""\nAfter Feyenoord had won the quarter-final first leg 1-0, Roma pushed for the opening goal from the start, missing two great opportunities in the first 10 minutes.\nThe visitors became more involved in the match, with Roma keeper Rui Patricio forced to deny Sebastian Szymanski from close range.\nImmediately after halftime, Roma had an excellent chance when a cross found Pellegrini at the near post but his shot hit the post.\n""I have to say that the emotions started before the match. You know you have to win for these people who give everything for us – and, consequently, we have to give everything for them,"" Pellegrini said.\nOn the hour mark, roars of relief erupted around the Stadio Olimpico when Leonardo Spinazzola took advantage of a deflection in the box to poke the ball into the bottom corner.\nMourinho started with key players Paulo Dybala and Abraham on the bench, after they suffered injuries early in the first leg, but he sent them on midway through the second half to chase a decider.\nIn the 80th minute, Brazilian Igor Paixao headed in an equaliser for the visitors, unmarked inside the box from a cross by Szymanski, only for Dybala to level the aggregate score one minute before stoppage time with a shot from a tricky angle.\nFeyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez received a straight red card in the game\'s final moments for a knee-high tackle on Gianluca Mancini.\n""I am never angry when we don’t do well, because I know these players gave everything. Now we must rest as much as we can, prepare for Serie A and forget the Europa League for now,"" Mourinho said.\nRoma will meet Bayer Leverkusen in the semi-finals on May 11 and 18 after the German side knocked out Union Saint-Gilloise 5-2 on aggregate.\nLeverkusen crush hosts Union 4-1 to book Europa League last-four spot\n\nBayer Leverkusen eased into the Europa League semi-finals after crushing hosts Union Saint-Gilloise of Belgium 4-1 on Thursday for a 5-2 aggregate win that stretched their unbeaten run to 12 straight matches across all competitions.\nThe result means Leverkusen, the last German team left in any European competition this season, have reached their first European semi-final in 21 years while ending Union\'s fairytale maiden run in the Europa League.\n""The mentality of the team was the key tonight,"" said Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso, who has turned around their season since taking over in October.\n""Obviously the early first goal by Moussa Diaby was very helpful. But overall we did it very well.\n""Now the team is ready to fight in a semi-final. We are a step closer to reaching the final but I\'ll only talk about the semi-final,"" said the Spaniard.\nLeverkusen, who face AS Roma in the last four, proved extremely efficient, needing just 66 seconds for Diaby to round keeper Anthony Moris and finish a quick move by the Germans to open the scoring.\nThey added another goal on the break in the 38th with Mitchel Bakker volleying in at the far post before they were gifted a third on the hour courtesy of a big Moris blunder.\nUnder pressure from Bakker, the keeper sent the ball straight into the path of Jeremie Frimpong who only had to kick it into the empty goal.\nThe Belgians did breath some life into their game, cutting the deficit with Casper Terho\'s fine shot in the 65th, but could not find another goal despite more pressure\nLeverkusen made sure they snapped their opponents\' nine-game unbeaten run when Adam Hlozek pounced on a weak Moris save to make it 4-1 in the 79th.\n\nIndia Cricket Score\xa0 | \xa0Indian Cricket News\xa0 | \xa0Indian News\xa0 | \xa0Bollywood Movies\xa0 | \xa0India Business News'}",Moussa Diaby,en

"{'content': 'Leverkusen\'s players celebrate after their team scored during the UEFA Europa League quarter-final ... [+] second-leg football match against Union Saint-Gilloise (Photo by LAURIE DIEFFEMBACQ/BELGA/AFP via Getty Images)\nBayer Leverkusen has reached the semifinal of a European competition by beating Belgian side Union Saint-Gilles 4-1 (5-2 on aggregate) on Thursday thanks to goals by Moussa Diaby (2’), Mitchel Bakker (37’), Jeremie Frimpong (60’) and Adam Hlozek (79’). Casper Terho (65’) scored the only goal for the hosts.\nIt marks the first time Leverkusen has reached the semifinal of a European competition since the club reached the Champions League final in the 2001/02 season. That year, Die Werkself was narrowly beaten 2-1 by Real Madrid thanks to a wonder strike by legendary French midfielder Zinedine Zidane. It was also the year that Leverkusen finished second in the league, second in the DFB Pokal, and then a large portion of the squad also finished second in the World Cup behind Brazil.\nThat season marked the origin of the term Vizekusen (Neverkusen). It is a term that current head coach Xabil Alonso wants to stamp out at the club. And a title for Leverkusen would do just that for a club that has won nothing since the 1992/93 season when the club beat Hertha Berlin’s reserve side to win the DFB Pokal.\nIn fairness, Leverkusen has had success in the Europa League, or rather its predecessor, the UEFA\nEFA\n Cup, winning the competition in 1988 by beating Spanish side Espanol. Now Leverkusen is just 180 minutes away from reaching the final of a European competition once again. While beating Roma will be difficult, there is a sense of optimism around the club that this is the year for Leverkusen to end the title drought.\nDirector of sports Simon Rolfes has stressed in the past that the Europa League would be an excellent pathway to end Leverkusen’s wait for a title. ""It is a big goal for us to win a title,"" Rolfes said in an interview conducted in November 2019. ""We have to have the ambitions to win the Europa League. It has to be our goal to play a key role in that competition.""\nNow four years later, the club has a realistic chance of winning an international trophy. In fact, winning the Europa League might be the most straightforward pathway to the Champions League, as Leverkusen is currently sixth, seven points behind fourth-placed RB Leipzig.\nBayer Leverkusen beat Espanol in 1988 to win the UEFA Cup (Photo by Bongarts/Getty Images)\n""We are focused on the semi-finals and are looking forward to preparing well,” Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso said after the game to UEFA.com. “The energy is good. Being in the semi-finals is great, but once you get there, you want more. We will do everything to win.""\nAlonso, of course, has been one of the major reasons for Leverkusen’s resurgence in the Bundesliga and the run of form in the Europa League. Since taking over the club in October, the Spaniard has overseen 29 games, won 16, drawn six, and only lost seven. Only Bayern, Dortmund, and Leipzig have collected more points in the Bundesliga since Alonso has taken over the club.\nThe Spaniard has been one of the major reasons for Leverkusen’s recent success. Another reason is Florian Wirtz. The teenage sensation has scored four goals and eight assists in 18 games since returning from his ACL injury. One of the most talented players on the planet, Wirtz has been crucial for his club’s success in recent weeks, and the 19-year-old is now fully focused on winning his first major trophy.\n""I\'d love to win the title,” Wirtz said to the German station RTL after the game. “It doesn\'t really bother me who we meet in the next round. We\'re going to see who it will be and will then prepare ourselves as well as possible for the next opponent."" Leverkusen does not want to sell Wirtz this summer, and winning the Europa League, which would come with an automatic spot in next season’s Champions League group stage, would go a long way to ensure that the forward will stay with the club.\nThat would be one significant advantage of winning the title. Another would be the added prestige a Europa League triumph would bring to the Bundesliga. Eintracht Frankfurt’s success last season was widely recognized around Europe, and for the league to grow, the Bundesliga will need other teams than Bayern to keep up the flag in Europe. Having back-to-back Europa League winners might not only keep a star in the league but also add significant prestige to the competition overall.\nManuel Veth is the host of the Bundesliga Gegenpressing Podcast and the Area Manager USA at Transfermarkt.

"{'content': 'Arsenal transfer news: The January transfer window was interesting (and important) for the Gunners as Mikel Arteta’s side is clearly a big contender for everything the Premier League has to offer… but the summer might have even more interesting subplots.[\xa0VIDEO:\xa0Premier League analysis ]\xa0After finishing two points behind north London rivals Tottenham, due to back-to-back defeats on Matchweeks 36 and 37 with UEFA Champions League qualification nearly in the bag, Arsenal isn’t leaving anything up to chance this go-round as they vie for the Premier League title.The Gunners lead the Premier League and show no signs of slowing down; They’ve been locking down their key performers to new deals as UEFA Champions League life is fast approaching the Arsenal.Following the departures of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Barcelona, in January 2022) and Alexandre Lacazette (end of contract, this summer), Arteta continues to rejuvenate an already stunning attack that includes Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka, and captain Martin Odegaard.[ TRANSFER NEWS: Liverpool | Chelsea | Tottenham | Man City\xa0| Man United ]Below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on Arsenal transfer news as Joe Prince-Wright (JPW), Nicholas Mendola (NM) and Andy Edwards (AE) will guide you through a hectic next few months.\nLatest transfer news\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Manchester United transfer news, live!

According to a report from talkSPORT, Rice prefers to make the short move from east London to north London, where the Mikel Arteta requires a defensive-minded midfielder around which to build the next team in his Arsenal project.West Ham will hope to get somewhere in the neighborhood of $125 million for Rice, but that could be a difficult sales pitch to Arsenal, who could simply wait 12 more months and sign him for free. (AE)April 9 – Gunners could vie with Tottenham for Ligue 1 hotshotMontpellier striker Elye Wahi’s 12 goals and three assists this season have Arsenal and Tottenham (as well as PSG) looking to woo the striker to North London this summer, according to French site\xa0Jeunes Footeux.Wahi turned 20 in January and he has a contract through the 2024-25 season so he won’t come cheap. The report says Montpellier’s asking for around $35 million.The center forward’s more than 6-feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday’s league match with Toulouse.The advanced stats say Wahi’s a raw scorer; He carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. Mikel Arteta already has a young English-American center forward coming back from loan in France and a few options already in North London but… maybe? (NM)April 1 – Aurelien Tchouameni targeted by Arsenal (again)Real Madrid splashed a lot of cash on Monaco star Aurelien Tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn’t starting opens him up for a sale, according to Catalan site El Nacional.Long-linked with Arsenal and Liverpool before moving to Real, Tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, and Manchester United.The 23-year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball.Carlo Ancelotti has found minutes for Tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means Real boss Florentino Perez is looking at an $80 million player who is often on the bench to start games. Could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (NM)March 20 – Arsenal wants Galatasaray fullbackMikel Arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to Turkey for a French youngster.Sacha Boey, 22, has been capped by France at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with Galatasaray.Boey has two goals in 23 appearances this year, having moved from Rennes in 2021. He previously racked up 30-plus Ligue 1 appearances between Rennes and Dijon.A report from Turkish site Aksam has Arsenal leading the race of Lyon, Sporting Lisbon, and Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. (NM)February 27 – Gunners linked with Serie A star striker, midfielderMikel Arteta sees some things he likes in Italy, where World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez and Serbia star Sergej Milinkovic-Savic are reported as targets for the Arsenal.Martinez, 25, had been starring for Inter Milan long before he helped Lionel Messi win a World Cup, and the Argentine has 16 goals and seven assists across all competitions this season.TeamTalk says that Chelsea and Manchester United are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka.Calcio Mercato has the report on Milinkovic-Savic to Arsenal. Could the Lazio star finally make his move to the Premier League after being linked with an England transfer for ages?The 27-year-old has 39 caps and seven goals for Serbia, and he’s twice been Serie A Best XI, including last season. Milinkovic-Savic is Lazio’s two-time defending Player of the Year.Milinkovic-Savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. Newcastle and West Ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him European football. Advantage: Arsenal? (NM)February 25 – Arsenal eye Atalanta strikerCan never have enough finishers, can you?Arsenal is said to be joining Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Newcastle in pursuit of 20-year-old Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund.Twice-capped by Denmark, Hojlund started at home with Copenhagen before heading to Austria’s Sturm Graz.Hojlund has 13 goals and five assists in 29 appearances across all competitions between Sturm Graz and Atalanta, scoring against Dynamo Kiev in Champions League qualification for the latter.He’s one to watch, but it’s also worth noting that Atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for Champions League places in Serie A. He could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the UCL and UEL at a club that spotted him early. Heck, would a club like Arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to Italy? (NM)February 25 – Bukayo Saka, William Saliba approach new dealsReports out of North London say that Arsenal is nearing new deals with 21-year-olds: Center back William Saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker Bukayo Saka.Saka signed his current deal in 2019 and it runs through the end of the 2023-24 season: It’s safe to say his career has since found a new level.London-born and with 24 England caps, Saka is one of the faces of Arsenal’s renaissance. A relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in Premier League play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market.Easy decision for the Gunners, given his status within the team.

The 31-year-old Italian, who started 15 of 20 Premier League games for Chelsea this season, should be an incredibly useful (and experienced) figure for Mikel Arteta, as the Gunners try to lift the PL trophy for the first time since 2004.\nWelcome to The Arsenal, Jorginho 👊 pic.twitter.com/jHXqAUBKKQ\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 31, 2023January 31 – Arsenal moves for Jorginho as Caicedo move collapsesBrighton wasn’t lying when it came to their desire to keep Moises Caicedo for a European push, and Arsenal has made a new plan.Reports say that Arsenal will sign Chelsea midfielder Jorginho on an 18-month deal with an option for an additional year. The price tag? About $15 million.Sure some Arsenal fans won’t love buying a player off of Chelsea, but Jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. The risk is low. (NM)January 29 – Brighton without Caicedo as talks continueA report from the Daily Mail says Arsenal have submitted a second bid for Moises Caicedo, with an improved offer of $86.6 million going in. Brighton are said to want $100 million for Caicedo. He did not play against Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday and reportedly he will not be around the team until Feb. 1, after the transfer deadline. Brighton have told Caicedo they want him to stay but his social media posting asking to be allowed to leave has put the writing on the wall. Will Arsenal up their offer and get their main ahead of Chelsea? (JPW)\nDe Zerbi: “Caicedo is a good guy. We will see. We hope he stays with us but this question for the club and Moises”🚨🇪🇨 #BHAFC #AFC\n“In life you can make mistakes. We will see the best solution for the club, for Caicedo and for us”, De Zerbi tells ITV via @AndyNaylorBHAFC. pic.twitter.com/fT9B2P6HFg\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 29, 2023January 28 – Moises Caicedo saga takes another twistEcuadorian midfielder Moises Caicedo has reportedly not shown up for training at Brighton after previously posting a message on social media asking for him to be allowed to leave. Arsenal reportedly had a $65 million bid for Caicedo rejected as Brighton do not want to sell him in January. Fabrizio Romano has said that Arsenal will go in with an improved offer. Caicedo, 21, has been a revelation for the Seagulls and has been chased by Chelsea, and many other Premier League heavyweights, since the summer. This latest twist could force Brighton’s hand in the final hours of the January window but they are likely to want closer to $85 million for their talented box-to-box midfielder. (JPW)\nEXCL: Moises Caicedo didn’t turn up for training today — he wants leave immediately. Caicedo could also miss tomorrow’s game. ⚠️ #BHAFC\n🚨 Understand Arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after £60m revealed yesterday. #AFC\n🔵 Chelsea offered £55m — rejected too. #CFC pic.twitter.com/Xzt2f43ACI\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 28, 2023January 26 – Amadou Onana also an optionIt has been reported by The Times that Chelsea have stepped up interest in Everton’s Belgium midfielder Amadou Onana. The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)January 26 – Huge offer for Caicedo on the way?It appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder. (JPW)January 25 – One back in (from La Liga), one out to FulhamReports say that Arsenal will led Cedric Soares head on loan to London neighbors Fulham, but not without a replacement.Sky Sports says that Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund are in hot pursuit of Real Valladolid right back Ivan Fresneda.Marca\xa0says that Fresneda missed Valladolid training amid reports that Arsenal matched BVB’s $15 million bid for the back.The 18-year-old has started regularly for Valladolid this season when healthy and has represented Spain at the U-18 and U-19 levels.Valladolid doesn’t have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to FBref.com. (NM)January 24 – Leeds join battle for McKennieAfter USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie was linked with a move to Arsenal, it appears that Leeds United are also keen on the American. According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week? That probably won’t be the case at Arsenal, at least initially. (JPW)\nLeeds are exploring new options for the midfield including Weston McKennie. It’s one of the possibilities considered by the club as @MatteMoretto has reported ⚪️🇺🇸 #LUFC\nThe list still includes Azzedine Ounahi after opening bid made weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/GyTQZdDnYs\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 24, 2023January 23 – Arsenal unveils Polish back Jakub Kiwior from SpeziaArsenal’s gone to Serie A for its latest signing, 22-year-old Jakub Kiwior of Spezia and the Poland national team.A member of Poland’s World Cup team, Kiwior had been with Spezia since the start of the 2021-22 season.The left-footed center back has nine caps for Poland and started all four of the club’s matches at the 2022 World Cup.Kiwior turns 23 next month and will wear No. 15. A fee has not been disclosed.\n💬 ""It’s huge for me that Arsenal were interested and that I’m able to be here.""\nWe\'re so happy to have you here, Jakub 🙌\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 23, 2023January 23 – USMNT star Weston McKennie linked with $22-27 million transferAccording to a report from Gazzetta dello Sport, USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie is wanted by Arsenal. Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)January 23 – Declan Rice linked with Arsenal againOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)January 21 – Eduardo Camavinga loan talksThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)January 20 – Leandro Trossard confirmed as newest Arsenal signing\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023January 19 – Trossard talks intensifyIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved. (JPW)\nEXCLUSIVE: Arsenal have opened talks to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton, negotiations are advanced with official bid ready for permanent move. 🚨⚪️🔴 #AFC\nPersonal terms already agreed — talks will continue to get deal done soon. pic.twitter.com/WgiCtz1jG1\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2023January 16 – Moussa Diaby a top target?Arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby is the latest target. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)January 16 – Gunners in Declan Rice driver’s seat?The London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.The 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.Rice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)January 16 – Raphinha, Ferran Torres interestAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)January 15 – Gunners have interest in Leandro TrossardAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup. (JPW)January 15 – Mudryk signs in $108 million deal on eight-and-a-half year dealMykhailo Mudryk has signed for Chelsea, as the Blues reportedly offered him double what Arsenal were prepared to pay him in wages. Mudryk, 22, has signed an eight-and-a-half year deal and the Ukrainian winger will be a big part of their future as they continue to expensively revamp their squad. As for Arsenal, this is one that got away as the finances of the deal just didn’t add up for the Gunners.

There have been reports over the last week or so that Chelsea could make a move for Mudryk but this latest update from Fabrizio Romano seems to be a lot more concrete and Chelsea are trying to get one over their London rivals. Arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with Shakhtar and it seems like Chelsea are ready to pay the Ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. This would be a huge blow for Arsenal but I guess every player has his price, right?

(AE)January 10 – Mudryk travels with Shakhtar as talks continueThe latest reports on Mykhaylo Mudryk to Arsenal have arrived and although the Gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the Ukraine international winger has flown to Turkey and gone on tour with them. Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.That said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. The structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and Arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp. Per the report, the issues with his contract talks at Barca involve the financial restraints they are facing and that has caused issues trying to agree new long-term contracts with current players. Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation. Both Arsenal and Newcastle are looking to add players in a structured and sensible way and Balde’s quality, and age, tick all of their boxes in terms of their recruitment model. (JPW)January 3 – Chelsea ready to pounce to seal Mudryk dealAnother day, another update on Mykhaylo Mudryk but this does not involved Arsenal. Per a report from Jack Rosser of The Sun, Chelsea are ready to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international as Arsenal have yet to agree a transfer fee with Shakhtar Donetsk. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window but Chelsea certainly need some fresh attacking talent too and Shakhtar’s sporting director Darijo Srna is set to hold talks with the Blues this week.

Per a report from Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal have submitted a bid of over $52.8 million up front to Shakhtar Donetsk. Plenty of add ons are included in the deal too. Romano adds that if Arsenal and Shakhtar cannot agree a fee, Chelsea are waiting in the wings to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window and given their recent recruitment success, it seems likely he will be another key part of Mikel Arteta’s jigsaw.

According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”Per our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)December 27 – Arsenal makes bid for Mykhailo MudrykReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.The Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.Some reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.Mudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe. Wow.Shakhtar is transferring from the Champions League to the Europa League playoffs, while Arsenal has a bye past the playoffs into the Round of 16.

Gabriel Jesus, 25, has joined the Gunners for $54.7 million from Manchester City, and Mikel Arteta will be absolutely delighted with this deal. With Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez arriving this summer, Jesus needed to move to get more minutes as he aims to start for Brazil at the World Cup in November. He has found the perfect spot at Arsenal, as they needed a number nine, his playing style and philosophy matches theirs perfectly, and he knows Arteta very well from the latter being Man City’s assistant coach. This transfer works so well for everyone it actually hurts. Now, if Jesus can just become a little more clinical, this will be one of the deals of the summer, but at least we now know that Jesus wants to play up front instead of on the right.

According to a report from talkSPORT, Rice prefers to make the short move from east London to north London, where the Mikel Arteta requires a defensive-minded midfielder around which to build the next team in his Arsenal project.\nWest Ham will hope to get somewhere in the neighborhood of $125 million for Rice, but that could be a difficult sales pitch to Arsenal, who could simply wait 12 more months and sign him for free.

Caicedo, 21, has been a revelation for the Seagulls and has been chased by Chelsea, and many other Premier League heavyweights, since the summer. This latest twist could force Brighton’s hand in the final hours of the January window but they are likely to want closer to $85 million for their talented box-to-box midfielder.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)\nIt appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder.

According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week?

Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)\nOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)\nThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023\n\nIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved. (JPW)\nEXCLUSIVE: Arsenal have opened talks to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton, negotiations are advanced with official bid ready for permanent move. 🚨⚪️🔴 #AFC\nPersonal terms already agreed — talks will continue to get deal done soon. pic.twitter.com/WgiCtz1jG1\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2023\n\nArsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby is the latest target. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)\nThe London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.\nThe 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.\nRice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)\nAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)\nAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup. (JPW)\nMykhailo Mudryk has signed for Chelsea, as the Blues reportedly offered him double what Arsenal were prepared to pay him in wages.

Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.\nThat said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments.

Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation.

Chelsea will act if #AFC move collapses. pic.twitter.com/P0svkKIyyw\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 3, 2023\n\nThat sound you can hear is Arsenal fans rubbing their hands with glee as Edu and Co. aim to sign one of the top young wingers in Europe. According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”\nPer our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)\nReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.\nThe Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.\nSome reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.\nMudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe. Wow.\nShakhtar is transferring from the Champions League to the Europa League playoffs, while Arsenal has a bye past the playoffs into the Round of 16.

Gabriel Jesus, 25, has joined the Gunners for $54.7 million from Manchester City, and Mikel Arteta will be absolutely delighted with this deal. With Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez arriving this summer, Jesus needed to move to get more minutes as he aims to start for Brazil at the World Cup in November. He has found the perfect spot at Arsenal, as they needed a number nine, his playing style and philosophy matches theirs perfectly, and he knows Arteta very well from the latter being Man City’s assistant coach. This transfer works so well for everyone it actually hurts. Now, if Jesus can just become a little more clinical, this will be one of the deals of the summer, but at least we now know that Jesus wants to play up front instead of on the right. (JPW)\n💬 ""I am so happy to be here to help. I come to help, to learn as well, and to try to do my best""\n📺 Watch Gabriel Jesus\' first interview right here 👇\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) July 4, 2022\n\nUSMNT goalkeeper Matt Turner has completed his move to Arsenal and is in north London settling in at his new club. It will take a lot for Turner to usurp Aaron Ramsdale as Arsenal’s starting goalkeeper but he should get plenty of minutes in the League Cup, FA Cup and Europa League this season. It will be intriguing to see how Turner fares early on at Arsenal, especially as they are heading to the U.S. on a preseason tour and he should play plenty of minutes for the Gunners as he gets to know his new teammates, coaches and settles in further. (JPW)\n✈️ From New Jersey to north London…\nWelcome home, Matty Turner ❤️\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) June 27, 2022\n\nWe have lift-off.\nArsenal has purchased Fabio Vieira — no relation to Patrick — for a reported $42 million fee.\nThe Porto man just turned 21 in late May and racked up the joint second-most assists in Portugal last season despite playing under 1400 minutes.\nWhat else will the Gunners get in Vieira, who can play left wing or second striker in addition to attacking midfield? Click here for more. (NM)\nMarquinhos, 19, is set to join Arsenal from Sao Paulo, according to The Guardian. They say that Arsenal have ‘won the race’ to sign the Brazilian forward, who will sign a five-year contract. Marquinhos is definitely a player for the future after he broke through at Sao Paulo last season and has been capped by Brazil at U17 level. As for a player for the here and now, this report states that Gabriel Jesus remains Arsenal’s main target. If they can bring in Jesus then Arteta will be delighted as the Gunners’ young squad continues to move in the direction as they battle for a top four finish. (JPW)\nAlexandre Lacazette’s Arsenal departure was already confirmed, but we now know that the 31-year-old French forward has rejoined Lyon on a free transfer. Lacazette spent seven season in the Lyon first team, where he scored 129 goals in 275 appearances (all competitions) from 2010-2017, before leaving the Ligue 1 side to sign for Arsenal. He made 206 appearances for the Gunners and scored 71 times in five seasons at the Emirates Stadium.

"{'content': 'This week, the testimony of Ben Youssouf Keïta struck a chord. He is the third opponent of Moussa Dadis Camara\'s former regime to testify at the Conakry stadium massacre trial. Victim and eyewitness of the bloody repression of September 28, 2009, he recounted the fatal chain of events that led to the killings.\nOn Tuesday April 11, 2023, Ben Youssouf Keïta, a 69-year-old surgeon and politician, was called to the stand. He is now the president of the Alliance for Change and Progress party. At the time of the events, he was a member of the political bureau of the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG). He was even the right-hand man of the party leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, according to journalist Mouctar Bah, an informed observer of Guinea in the late 2000s.\nKeïta is the third political opponent to be heard at the trial. He has just become a civil party in the case. ""Some people are certainly wondering why, 13 years later, I am presenting myself today, and in a spontaneous manner,"" he said. ""Well, for two reasons. First, if my fate was more enviable than those who lost their lives, my wife suffered martyrdom at the stadium [she was beaten by soldiers and had her throat cut]."" Second, as a political leader Keïta feels it is his duty to come and testify: ""We have a moral responsibility towards those who died, because they are our activists. We are the ones who called them to follow us.""\nNo to Dadis as presidential candidate\nOn September 28, 2009, the main opposition parties - united in a coalition called Forces Vives - organized a meeting to say no to the possible presidential candidacy of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara, leader of the military transition. Security forces burst in on the rally, firing live ammunition into the crowd and sexually assaulting female activists. In the days that followed, killings and rapes continued. According to the report of the international commission of inquiry appointed by the United Nations, at least 156 people were killed and 109 women raped.\nKeïta tells the story of his day.\nIt was 5.45 on the morning of September 28, 2009, when his phone rang. ""It was my older brother retired from the Guinean army calling me,"" he told the court. ""This brother, I consider him a father, he followed me to the UFDG. He was one of the people in charge of the executive office, in the security commission. He told me \'Youssouf, don\'t go out today, it\'s forbidden, you have to stay at home\'. At that time, we still remembered the events of January-February 2007, during which at least 129 young Guineans were killed in cold blood during demonstrations. As my brother was insisting and it was unusual, I panicked."" Then, according to his testimony in court, Ben Youssouf Keïta said to himself: ""If I don\'t leave, I will be considered a traitor, a coward. What must happen will happen.""\nWarnings don\'t stop the opposition\nAt 6:00 a.m. he said goodbye to wife and rushed into a pick-up truck, taking his 25-year-old son with him. He crossed Conakry at full speed, he said, to reach the residence of Cellou Dalein Diallo, not far from the stadium. ""It was a first signal. Usually it took 30 to 40 minutes, not ten. Everything was empty."" Arriving at the UFDG leader\'s house, Keïta told him about the warning he had received earlier. ""Cellou had also received some information during the night. The warnings were not wrong,"" he continued. ""But according to him, we had to go, and we were going to go. I was very comforted by his position, his determination to fight to the end.""\nThe two men set off towards the home of Jean-Marie Doré, another opponent and head of the Union for the Progress of Guinea (UPG). The political leaders had made an appointment to meet there. Once there, his householders were hesitant. ""Jean-Marie Doré tells Cellou, Sidya (Sidya Touré, president of the Union of Republican Forces) and the others that he cannot go,"" they said, according to Keïta. ""He has just spoken to the Head of State by telephone. The latter asked him to wait for the arrival of a delegation to meet with the leaders at his home."" Touré received the same call late at night, he said, but felt it was impossible to postpone the rally. Diallo spoke up, according to Keïta, saying: ""We have to leave, because the population has already turned out, we have no way to delay the rally."" All the opposition leaders - with the exception of Doré - then set off to join ""the bulk of the troops at the stadium"".\n""There was so much noise, you couldn\'t hear the gunfire""\nA ""human tide"" awaited them there, according to Ben Youssouf Keïta, an estimated several thousand people. While the politicians had planned to make their speech on the esplanade in front of the stadium, they were dragged inside by a frenzied crowd. ""It was euphoria, celebration,"" he recalled. Keïta climbed into the stands with the other leaders. There was an atmosphere of joyful chaos. ""There was so much noise, you couldn\'t hear the gunfire,"" he told the court. Suddenly, he saw people starting to fall under fire. The danger was getting closer, and everyone was fleeing. It was ""every man for himself"".\nKeïta stayed next to his leader. A hooded soldier advanced towards them. He called out to Diallo and ordered him to come down from the stands. The UFDG leader did not comply. The soldier charged at him, made him fall to the ground and hit him brutally. Keïta escaped and miraculously managed to get out of the stadium. But in front of the entrance, just as he thought he was out of trouble, he came across a soldier armed with a piece of wood who tried to smash his skull. Keïta protected himself and escaped with a broken hand and a wound on his back. Diallo suffered four broken ribs. Several opposition leaders were injured that day, but none fatally.\nOpposition responsibility?\nBen Youssouf Keïta was admitted to the emergency room of Donka Hospital, he said, around 2-2.30 in the afternoon. While waiting to be taken care of, he saw ""young people, women, lying around moaning"". The Minister of Health, Colonel Abdoulaye Chérif Diaby who is now in the dock, ""passed within a metre"" of him, according to the witness, reprimanding the wounded. He was ""furious"", according to Keïta. ""I am here today to understand,"" he told the court. ""I have absolutely no hatred against anyone, I do not cry vengeance and I do not want any compensation, neither material nor financial, but I want to understand. When you understand something you can tolerate it, bear it. Why didn\'t this Minister of Health, who took the Hippocratic Oath, act like a doctor? He didn\'t have the pity he should have when faced with those who suffer.""\nGet the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nBy submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.\nAlmost finished...\nWe need to confirm your email address.\nTo complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you.\nThere was a problem processing your submission.

One of them questioned Keïta: ""Doctor, you have maintained here that if you had complied with the request to postpone the demonstration on September 28, what happened at the stadium would not have happened. Do you stand by this statement?\nKeïta nodded.\nLanciné Sylla, counsel for Moussa Dadis Camara\'s former aide-de-camp Aboubacar Diakité (""Toumba"") retorted:\n""Do you agree with me that in this trial you, the political leaders, are victims and not defendants?""\n""There is no doubt.""\n""As such, can we seek any responsibility against you in this trial?""\n""Absolutely not.""\n""We didn\'t think they would send men to the stadium with helmets and lethal weapons against the unarmed population,"" Keita said in defence. The scenario he painted through his words is that of a punitive, premeditated and inevitable attack against an opposition that was defying the authority of the head of state to defend democratic principles.\n""Mr. Bah Oury said it here, and so did Mr. François Loucény Fall [the two politicians previously heard by the court]. Was it on the day of the demonstration itself that a postponement could be called?"" asked Toumba\'s lawyer.\n""From the moment the people were called out, it would take at least 48 or 72 hours to inform them that the demonstration was postponed,"" Ben Youssouf Keïta replied without hesitation.\nRead the original article on JusticeInfo.net.\nAllAfrica publishes around 500 reports a day from more than 100 news organizations and over 500 other institutions and individuals, representing a diversity of positions on every topic.

I went as high as I could, I put power on it, but it was an incredible save.’\nFor slightly different reasons, Paris Saint-Germain’s grounds staff know exactly what it is like to be left exasperated by Maignan, 27.\n‘I loved refereeing the ‘goal to goal’ [drill],’ Nicolas Dehon, Maignan’s goalkeeper coach during his PSG days told Sportsmail.\n‘The goals were 20 metres apart and the goalkeepers had to score past one another and after a win he [Maignan] he liked to slide on his knees so I got emails from the gardener to the sports director saying that he was ruining the pitch.’\nMaignan joined PSG in his early teens and his development has seen him added to the list of ones that got away from France’s biggest club which includes the likes of Bayern Munich’s Kingsley Coman, Chelsea-bound Christopher Nkunku and Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby.\nIn Maignan’s time at PSG, Dehon was a key figure.\n‘He was a very hard-working goalkeeper,’ Dehon, now coaching at Nice, remembered.\n‘He liked the challenge and variety in training sessions. He asked for advice, he was very respectful. I had a father-son relationship with him.\nMaignan will have to be at his best to stop a free-scoring Napoli in the Champions League\n‘One day after a session where I wasn’t happy with his work I did a 10 second work/10 second recovery exercise.\n‘For this, I took Claude Makalele to be the shooter. It was a punishment but he didn’t give up.’\nRegardless of the reputation of the player he was facing.\nDehon continued: ‘He was a complete goalkeeper who came out of the training centre. He had impressive mental strength and was not afraid to face players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Edinson Cavani.\n'He was often put in as a player when we had games without a goalkeeper and he didn’t look out of place.\n‘When you train with great players everything goes faster and he had this ability to adapt. He was quicker in his reaction time.\n‘Against the great players of PSG he stopped all the shots. He challenged these great players and often won. Then I said to myself that he was going to be a great goalkeeper.’\nThough not one PSG were able to retain.\n‘With his personality and ambition I knew he would succeed in his clubs,’ Dehon said.\nThe French shot-stopper (orange top) has been in terrific form for AC Milan so far this season\nMaignan was tipped to become one of the best goalkeepers in the world by previous PSG coach\xa0Nicolas Dehon\n‘At PSG it wasn’t easy because there were very good goalkeepers in the hierarchy. He had done six months in the reserve team and at the end of the season he had me meet his agents to tell me he had been through the reserve team and wanted to leave.\n‘I explained to him that he had to be patient because he had only played six months in the reserve team. He stayed for another year and to see him leave after that was my biggest heartbreak but the door was closed for him at PSG.’\nMaignan moved on to Lille where he first got the chance to prove he is more than capable of filling big gloves.\nMaignan saw off competition to be crowned as\xa0France’s goalkeeper of the year in 2019\nHe eventually took over from Vincent Enyeama and went on to be crowned France’s goalkeeper of the year in 2019.\nHis displays in France earned Maignan his 2021 move to Milan where he succeed Gianluigi Donnarumma following his own move to PSG.\nMaignan was crowned Serie A goalkeeper of the year in 2022 too after helping Milan win their first title for 11 years.\nNow, at international level, it is Lloris’s long-held position in France’s goal that he is now filling.

If the Man United are beaten to the signing of Frimpong, the Premier League club could instead throw all their efforts behind signing Pavard.\nWith Pavard\'s standing in the Bayern team likely to be under added threat upon Frimpong\'s arrival, that could create a suitable Plan B for Man United, with various outlets already reporting that the 27-year-old could leave the Allianz Arena.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Why Bayern Munich fired their coach\nAnother Football Insider report echoes ESPN\'s previous reporting that Manchester United are keeping tabs on Veiga ahead of a possible summer move, having already scouted the 20-year-old on several occasions.\nMan United manager Erik ten Hag is looking to strengthen in central midfield and Veiga has been enjoying a breakthrough campaign for Celta Vigo, recording nine goals and four assists in 26 LaLiga matches so far this term.\nEven so, a third report states that midfielder Marcel Sabitzer is keen to make his loan from Bayern Munich permanent with Man United looking to complete a deal.

However, getting Balde to commit his future to the club is just the first part of the dilemma for Barca as they also have to be able to register his new contract with LaLiga.\nGavi, Ronald Araujo and Marcos Alonso have also signed new deals in the last year but none have yet been registered with the Spanish league.\nBarca must reduce as much as €150m from their annual outgoings -- or raise money through transfers -- before LaLiga will inscribe the new deals.\n10.25 BST: English clubs are lining up to sign the Barcelona winger Abde Ezzalzouli, according to various reports in Spain.\nDiario Sport claims Wolverhampton Wanderers want to bring in the Morocco international this summer, while Mundo Deportivo adds that ""half the Premier League"" are tracking him.\nAbde, 21, scored twice at the weekend as Osasuna came from behind to beat Elche 2-1 in LaLiga to continue his impressive season on loan in Pamplona.

When he returns, we will look at it and decide what we do with him.

While a much-improved defence has meant that hasn\'t cost them in LaLiga, it has seen them come up short in the Champions League, the Europa League and the Copa del Rey.\nTherefore, Barca are planning to bring in new faces to freshen up their front line. Abde could return after an impressive season on loan at Osasuna and the club have already secured a €15m option to sign winger Carrasco from Atletico Madrid.\nThe Catalan side also want to add a striker to take the weight off Lewandowski. Brazilian teenager Roque is their top target, but if his price tag proves too high, they could bring Aubameyang back from Chelsea if he accepts a salary cut.

The Blues are said to be willing to accept offers in the region of £20m, with West Ham United and Fulham also looking at the Morocco international.\n- Internazionale like Tigre striker Mateo Retegui but will not commit to signing him until June, reports Calciomercato, with the probable valuation of around €20m for the 23-year-old potentially causing problems for the Champions League quarterfinalists. I Nerazzurri would need to qualify for Europe\'s primary competition again and complete certain transfers to make a deal happen, while Retegui -- who scored on his national team debut -- has made no secret of his desire to play in Italy.\n- Fabrizio Romano has suggested that Brentford goalkeeper David Raya will not sign a new contract, with his current one expiring in 2024.

According to a report from talkSPORT, Rice prefers to make the short move from east London to north London, where the Mikel Arteta requires a defensive-minded midfielder around which to build the next team in his Arsenal project.West Ham will hope to get somewhere in the neighborhood of $125 million for Rice, but that could be a difficult sales pitch to Arsenal, who could simply wait 12 more months and sign him for free. (AE)April 9 – Gunners could vie with Tottenham for Ligue 1 hotshotMontpellier striker Elye Wahi’s 12 goals and three assists this season have Arsenal and Tottenham (as well as PSG) looking to woo the striker to North London this summer, according to French site\xa0Jeunes Footeux.Wahi turned 20 in January and he has a contract through the 2024-25 season so he won’t come cheap. The report says Montpellier’s asking for around $35 million.The center forward’s more than 6-feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday’s league match with Toulouse.The advanced stats say Wahi’s a raw scorer; He carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. Mikel Arteta already has a young English-American center forward coming back from loan in France and a few options already in North London but… maybe? (NM)April 1 – Aurelien Tchouameni targeted by Arsenal (again)Real Madrid splashed a lot of cash on Monaco star Aurelien Tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn’t starting opens him up for a sale, according to Catalan site El Nacional.Long-linked with Arsenal and Liverpool before moving to Real, Tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, and Manchester United.The 23-year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball.Carlo Ancelotti has found minutes for Tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means Real boss Florentino Perez is looking at an $80 million player who is often on the bench to start games. Could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (NM)March 20 – Arsenal wants Galatasaray fullbackMikel Arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to Turkey for a French youngster.Sacha Boey, 22, has been capped by France at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with Galatasaray.Boey has two goals in 23 appearances this year, having moved from Rennes in 2021. He previously racked up 30-plus Ligue 1 appearances between Rennes and Dijon.A report from Turkish site Aksam has Arsenal leading the race of Lyon, Sporting Lisbon, and Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. (NM)February 27 – Gunners linked with Serie A star striker, midfielderMikel Arteta sees some things he likes in Italy, where World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez and Serbia star Sergej Milinkovic-Savic are reported as targets for the Arsenal.Martinez, 25, had been starring for Inter Milan long before he helped Lionel Messi win a World Cup, and the Argentine has 16 goals and seven assists across all competitions this season.TeamTalk says that Chelsea and Manchester United are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka.Calcio Mercato has the report on Milinkovic-Savic to Arsenal. Could the Lazio star finally make his move to the Premier League after being linked with an England transfer for ages?The 27-year-old has 39 caps and seven goals for Serbia, and he’s twice been Serie A Best XI, including last season. Milinkovic-Savic is Lazio’s two-time defending Player of the Year.Milinkovic-Savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. Newcastle and West Ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him European football. Advantage: Arsenal? (NM)February 25 – Arsenal eye Atalanta strikerCan never have enough finishers, can you?Arsenal is said to be joining Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Newcastle in pursuit of 20-year-old Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund.Twice-capped by Denmark, Hojlund started at home with Copenhagen before heading to Austria’s Sturm Graz.Hojlund has 13 goals and five assists in 29 appearances across all competitions between Sturm Graz and Atalanta, scoring against Dynamo Kiev in Champions League qualification for the latter.He’s one to watch, but it’s also worth noting that Atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for Champions League places in Serie A. He could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the UCL and UEL at a club that spotted him early. Heck, would a club like Arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to Italy? (NM)February 25 – Bukayo Saka, William Saliba approach new dealsReports out of North London say that Arsenal is nearing new deals with 21-year-olds: Center back William Saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker Bukayo Saka.Saka signed his current deal in 2019 and it runs through the end of the 2023-24 season: It’s safe to say his career has since found a new level.London-born and with 24 England caps, Saka is one of the faces of Arsenal’s renaissance. A relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in Premier League play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market.Easy decision for the Gunners, given his status within the team.

The price tag? About $15 million.Sure some Arsenal fans won’t love buying a player off of Chelsea, but Jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. The risk is low. (NM)January 29 – Brighton without Caicedo as talks continueA report from the Daily Mail says Arsenal have submitted a second bid for Moises Caicedo, with an improved offer of $86.6 million going in. Brighton are said to want $100 million for Caicedo. He did not play against Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday and reportedly he will not be around the team until Feb. 1, after the transfer deadline. Brighton have told Caicedo they want him to stay but his social media posting asking to be allowed to leave has put the writing on the wall.

Arsenal reportedly had a $65 million bid for Caicedo rejected as Brighton do not want to sell him in January. Fabrizio Romano has said that Arsenal will go in with an improved offer. Caicedo, 21, has been a revelation for the Seagulls and has been chased by Chelsea, and many other Premier League heavyweights, since the summer. This latest twist could force Brighton’s hand in the final hours of the January window but they are likely to want closer to $85 million for their talented box-to-box midfielder. (JPW)\nEXCL: Moises Caicedo didn’t turn up for training today — he wants leave immediately.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)January 26 – Huge offer for Caicedo on the way?It appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder. (JPW)January 25 – One back in (from La Liga), one out to FulhamReports say that Arsenal will led Cedric Soares head on loan to London neighbors Fulham, but not without a replacement.Sky Sports says that Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund are in hot pursuit of Real Valladolid right back Ivan Fresneda.Marca\xa0says that Fresneda missed Valladolid training amid reports that Arsenal matched BVB’s $15 million bid for the back.The 18-year-old has started regularly for Valladolid this season when healthy and has represented Spain at the U-18 and U-19 levels.Valladolid doesn’t have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to FBref.com. (NM)January 24 – Leeds join battle for McKennieAfter USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie was linked with a move to Arsenal, it appears that Leeds United are also keen on the American. According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week? That probably won’t be the case at Arsenal, at least initially. (JPW)\nLeeds are exploring new options for the midfield including Weston McKennie. It’s one of the possibilities considered by the club as @MatteMoretto has reported ⚪️🇺🇸 #LUFC\nThe list still includes Azzedine Ounahi after opening bid made weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/GyTQZdDnYs\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 24, 2023January 23 – Arsenal unveils Polish back Jakub Kiwior from SpeziaArsenal’s gone to Serie A for its latest signing, 22-year-old Jakub Kiwior of Spezia and the Poland national team.A member of Poland’s World Cup team, Kiwior had been with Spezia since the start of the 2021-22 season.The left-footed center back has nine caps for Poland and started all four of the club’s matches at the 2022 World Cup.Kiwior turns 23 next month and will wear No. 15. A fee has not been disclosed.\n💬 ""It’s huge for me that Arsenal were interested and that I’m able to be here.""\nWe\'re so happy to have you here, Jakub 🙌\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 23, 2023January 23 – USMNT star Weston McKennie linked with $22-27 million transferAccording to a report from Gazzetta dello Sport, USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie is wanted by Arsenal. Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)January 23 – Declan Rice linked with Arsenal againOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)January 21 – Eduardo Camavinga loan talksThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)January 20 – Leandro Trossard confirmed as newest Arsenal signing\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023January 19 – Trossard talks intensifyIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved. (JPW)\nEXCLUSIVE: Arsenal have opened talks to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton, negotiations are advanced with official bid ready for permanent move. 🚨⚪️🔴 #AFC\nPersonal terms already agreed — talks will continue to get deal done soon. pic.twitter.com/WgiCtz1jG1\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2023January 16 – Moussa Diaby a top target?Arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby is the latest target. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)January 16 – Gunners in Declan Rice driver’s seat?The London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.The 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.Rice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)January 16 – Raphinha, Ferran Torres interestAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)January 15 – Gunners have interest in Leandro TrossardAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup.

Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.That said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. The structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and Arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp. Per the report, the issues with his contract talks at Barca involve the financial restraints they are facing and that has caused issues trying to agree new long-term contracts with current players. Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation. Both Arsenal and Newcastle are looking to add players in a structured and sensible way and Balde’s quality, and age, tick all of their boxes in terms of their recruitment model.

Romano adds that if Arsenal and Shakhtar cannot agree a fee, Chelsea are waiting in the wings to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window and given their recent recruitment success, it seems likely he will be another key part of Mikel Arteta’s jigsaw.

According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”Per our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)December 27 – Arsenal makes bid for Mykhailo MudrykReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.The Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.Some reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.Mudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)\nIt appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder.

Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)\nOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)\nThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023\n\nIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved.

The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)\nThe London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.\nThe 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.\nRice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)\nAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)\nAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup. (JPW)\nMykhailo Mudryk has signed for Chelsea, as the Blues reportedly offered him double what Arsenal were prepared to pay him in wages. Mudryk, 22, has signed an eight-and-a-half year deal and the Ukrainian winger will be a big part of their future as they continue to expensively revamp their squad. As for Arsenal, this is one that got away as the finances of the deal just didn’t add up for the Gunners. They are now moving on to other options… (JPW)\n🚨 Chelsea complete the signing of Mudryk on an eight-and-a-half year deal. Is this a game-changer for #CFC? https://t.co/YZ3OGFnYdG\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) January 15, 2023\n\nThis is absolutely bonkers. There have been reports over the last week or so that Chelsea could make a move for Mudryk but this latest update from Fabrizio Romano seems to be a lot more concrete and Chelsea are trying to get one over their London rivals. Arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with Shakhtar and it seems like Chelsea are ready to pay the Ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. This would be a huge blow for Arsenal but I guess every player has his price, right? (JPW)\n🚨 EXCLUSIVE: Chelsea board now in Poland trying to reach verbal agreement with Shakhtar for Mudryk and hijack the deal! Official bid ready close to €100m. 🔵 #CFC\nArsenal always been leading the race, in talks with Shakhtar after 3d official bid.\nMudryk position, now crucial. pic.twitter.com/CwWWerfoQ8\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 14, 2023\n\nAccording to the latest report regarding Arsenal’s pursuit of Mykhaylo Mudryk, progress is being made as Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk go back and forth over the transfer fee. $60 million is the latest reported base fee, with another $30 million expected in add-ons. (AE)\nThe latest reports on Mykhaylo Mudryk to Arsenal have arrived and although the Gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the Ukraine international winger has flown to Turkey and gone on tour with them. Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.\nThat said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. The structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and Arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup. (JPW)\nShakhtar Donetsk finally show signs of cracking over Mykhaylo Mudryk as Arsenal make positive steps towards agreement during talks on Monday. First time Gunners have received indication deal can be struck on what they consider to be realistic terms. #AFC https://t.co/Xh67VnFCnD\n— Ryan Taylor (@RyanTaylorSport) January 10, 2023\n\nA report from Sport in Spain says that both Arsenal and Newcastle want to sign Barcelona left back Alejandro Balde. The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp. Per the report, the issues with his contract talks at Barca involve the financial restraints they are facing and that has caused issues trying to agree new long-term contracts with current players. Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation. Both Arsenal and Newcastle are looking to add players in a structured and sensible way and Balde’s quality, and age, tick all of their boxes in terms of their recruitment model. (JPW)\nAnother day, another update on Mykhaylo Mudryk but this does not involved Arsenal. Per a report from Jack Rosser of The Sun, Chelsea are ready to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international as Arsenal have yet to agree a transfer fee with Shakhtar Donetsk. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window but Chelsea certainly need some fresh attacking talent too and Shakhtar’s sporting director Darijo Srna is set to hold talks with the Blues this week. This all feels very Willian and Luis Diaz esque. (JPW)\nExclusive: Chelsea are in talks with Shakhtar Donetsk over a deal for Mykhaylo Mudryk and could hijack Arsenal\'s move.\nDarijo Srna expected in London to meet with the Blues this week.\nMore on @TheSunFootball shortly. #CFC #AFC\n— Jack Rosser (@JackRosser_) January 3, 2023\n\nAnother day, another update on Arsenal’s pursuit of Mykhaylo Mudryk. Per a report from Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal have submitted a bid of over $52.8 million up front to Shakhtar Donetsk. Plenty of add ons are included in the deal too. Romano adds that if Arsenal and Shakhtar cannot agree a fee, Chelsea are waiting in the wings to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window and given their recent recruitment success, it seems likely he will be another key part of Mikel Arteta’s jigsaw. (JPW)\nArsenal second proposal for Mykhaylo Mudryk is close to €50m fixed fee plus add-ons. Shakhtar expected to make a decision, the clubs are in direct contact. ⚪️🔴🇺🇦 #AFC\nPersonal terms, never been an issue – Arsenal is player\'s priority. Chelsea will act if #AFC move collapses. pic.twitter.com/P0svkKIyyw\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 3, 2023\n\nThat sound you can hear is Arsenal fans rubbing their hands with glee as Edu and Co. aim to sign one of the top young wingers in Europe. According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”\nPer our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)\nReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.\nThe Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.\nSome reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.\nMudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe. Wow.\nShakhtar is transferring from the Champions League to the Europa League playoffs, while Arsenal has a bye past the playoffs into the Round of 16.

Gabriel Jesus, 25, has joined the Gunners for $54.7 million from Manchester City, and Mikel Arteta will be absolutely delighted with this deal. With Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez arriving this summer, Jesus needed to move to get more minutes as he aims to start for Brazil at the World Cup in November. He has found the perfect spot at Arsenal, as they needed a number nine, his playing style and philosophy matches theirs perfectly, and he knows Arteta very well from the latter being Man City’s assistant coach. This transfer works so well for everyone it actually hurts. Now, if Jesus can just become a little more clinical, this will be one of the deals of the summer, but at least we now know that Jesus wants to play up front instead of on the right. (JPW)\n💬 ""I am so happy to be here to help. I come to help, to learn as well, and to try to do my best""\n📺 Watch Gabriel Jesus\' first interview right here 👇\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) July 4, 2022\n\nUSMNT goalkeeper Matt Turner has completed his move to Arsenal and is in north London settling in at his new club. It will take a lot for Turner to usurp Aaron Ramsdale as Arsenal’s starting goalkeeper but he should get plenty of minutes in the League Cup, FA Cup and Europa League this season. It will be intriguing to see how Turner fares early on at Arsenal, especially as they are heading to the U.S. on a preseason tour and he should play plenty of minutes for the Gunners as he gets to know his new teammates, coaches and settles in further. (JPW)\n✈️ From New Jersey to north London…\nWelcome home, Matty Turner ❤️\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) June 27, 2022\n\nWe have lift-off.\nArsenal has purchased Fabio Vieira — no relation to Patrick — for a reported $42 million fee.\nThe Porto man just turned 21 in late May and racked up the joint second-most assists in Portugal last season despite playing under 1400 minutes.\nWhat else will the Gunners get in Vieira, who can play left wing or second striker in addition to attacking midfield? Click here for more. (NM)\nMarquinhos, 19, is set to join Arsenal from Sao Paulo, according to The Guardian. They say that Arsenal have ‘won the race’ to sign the Brazilian forward, who will sign a five-year contract. Marquinhos is definitely a player for the future after he broke through at Sao Paulo last season and has been capped by Brazil at U17 level. As for a player for the here and now, this report states that Gabriel Jesus remains Arsenal’s main target. If they can bring in Jesus then Arteta will be delighted as the Gunners’ young squad continues to move in the direction as they battle for a top four finish. (JPW)\nAlexandre Lacazette’s Arsenal departure was already confirmed, but we now know that the 31-year-old French forward has rejoined Lyon on a free transfer. Lacazette spent seven season in the Lyon first team, where he scored 129 goals in 275 appearances (all competitions) from 2010-2017, before leaving the Ligue 1 side to sign for Arsenal. He made 206 appearances for the Gunners and scored 71 times in five seasons at the Emirates Stadium.

He said then that offers as low as 1% of the equivalent TV rights price paid for the men’s World Cup were “not acceptable.”In March, for world soccer’s annual meeting in Rwanda, Infantino reported no progress with TV broadcasters while also announcing a more than three-fold increase in team prize money to $110 million for the tournament.Infantino has been clearly rankled that player-led criticism of FIFA for not offering equal prize money – the 32 men’s teams shared $440 million prize money at the 2022 World Cup – is amplified by media he believes is undervaluing women’s soccer.The Women’s World Cup has standalone broadcast and sponsor deals rather than being bundled with the men’s tournament – a policy started since Infantino was elected in 2016, when he pledged “continued and intensified effort” to develop the women’s game.The FIFA leader suggested on Monday “public broadcasters in particular have a duty to promote and invest in women’s sport.”“Women deserve it!

The BBC’s sports department has been led by a woman, Barbara Slater, for 14 years.Asked for a response on Tuesday to Infantino’s threat, the BBC said it did not comment on sports negotiations.This Women’s World Cup is far from an ideal time zone for European broadcasters. Daytime games in Australia and New Zealand play in the early hours of the morning in Europe, though Infantino said that was not an excuse.Acknowledging it was not primetime in Europe, Infantino noted the European kickoff times of 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. “is quite a reasonable time” for viewers.“It doesn’t make any economic sense because the viewing figures are there,” he added.At the 2019 Women’s World Cup hosted by France, FIFA claimed a total global audience of 1.12 billion for the 52-game tournament across all broadcast platforms.A verified average live audience of 82 million viewers watched the 2019 final with 263 million people watching at least one minute of the United States’ victory over the Netherlands.While FIFA is playing hardball with broadcasters, European soccer body UEFA took a different approach to build an audience for its annual Women’s Champions League competition – giving games away for free on YouTube.UEFA signed a four-year deal in 2021 with streaming platform DAZN that ensured fans in Europe could watch the first two seasons on YouTube. Some games will also be free for the next two seasons.Many European countries are already assured of seeing most or all of the 64-game Women’s World Cup on free-to-air channels.The European Broadcasting Union announced a collective 28-nation deal with FIFA in October that covers Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, Switzerland and Turkey. The value was not disclosed.FIFA’s policy of separate deals for the women’s tournament previously made headlines this year when soccer and public officials in Australia and New Zealand objected to planned sponsorship by the Saudi Arabia tourism board.

"{'content': 'Ganz entspannt beim Frühstück in Amsterdam: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nBayer Leverkusen ist unter Xabi Alonso (41) jetzt 14 Pflichtspiele in Folge in der  Bundesliga und der  Europa League unbesiegt. Eine beeindruckende Serie.\nNach dem 0:0 bei Union Berlin hatte die Werkself zwei Tage frei. Auch der Bayer-Trainer nutzte die Auszeit vor den wichtigen Duellen gegen den  1. FC Köln (Freitag, 20.30 Uhr) und bei der AS Roma (11.5./21 Uhr) zu einem Kurz-Trip mit seiner Familie nach Amsterdam.\nIn Leverkusen beginnt ab Dienstag die Vorbereitung auf die heiße Schluss-Phase der Saison. „Wir gehen mit viel Energie in das Derby“, kündigte Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah (27) nach dem Spiel in Berlin an.\n\nWas dahinter steckt Union-Fans pfeifen DFB-Star 90 Minuten aus\nGegen Köln darf Alonso auf die Rückkehr von Weltmeister Exequiel Palacios (24/Oberschenkel) hoffen. Der Argentinier soll in dieser Woche wieder mit der Mannschaft trainieren und dürfte – wenn es keinen Rückschlag gibt – wieder neben Robert Andrich (28) auf der Doppel-Sechs beginnen.\nAuch der zuletzt in Berlin gelb-gesperrte Nadiem Amiri (26) ist gegen den FC wieder dabei.

Er hatte sich nach seiner Leih-Rückkehr vom Italien-Absteiger CFC Genua im vergangenen Sommer selbst wieder in die Mannschaft gekämpft. Er hatte auf einen erneuten Wechsel verzichtet und wollte sich in Leverkusen durchbeißen.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nKaum ein Durchkommen: Leverkusens Florian Wirtz (links) verzweifelt am Samstag an der Defensive von Union Berlin: ""Die wissen hier jeden Meter richtig einzuschätzen.""\nNach dem leistungsgerechten 0:0 lobt Berlins Trainer Urs Fischer den Auftritt gegen die ""formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga"" und wirkt trotz der Siege der Rivalen nicht besorgt um einen Platz in einem europäischen Wettbewerb.\nVon Javier Cáceres, Berlin\nIn einem Spiel, das ein einziger Gesang an die Konzentration zweier defensiv fehlerloser Mannschaften war, haben Union Berlin und Bayer Leverkusen einander wichtige Punkte für den Saisonschlussspurt abgenommen. Am fünftletzten Spieltag der Bundesliga trennten sich die beiden stabilsten Teams des laufenden Kalenderjahres in einem ""tollen, intensiven Nullzunullspiel"", wie Unions Trainer Urs Fischer sagte, überaus leistungsgerecht\xa0torlos.\nUnion bleibt zwar Tabellendritter, spürt nun aber im Nacken den Atem der Verfolger: Freiburg ist nach dem 1:0-Sieg in Köln punktgleicher Vierter und steht wegen des schlechteren Torverhältnisses hinter den Berlinern; Leipzig ist durch den Sieg gegen Hoffenheim (ebenfalls 1:0) als Fünfter auf zwei Punkte herangekommen. Leverkusen wiederum ist acht Punkte hinter dem Champions-League-Platz vier. Trainer Xabi Alonso denkt nicht daran, das Ziel aufzugeben, das maximal Mögliche anzustreben. ""Wir müssen realistisch sein. Aber wir waren vor zwei oder vier Monaten in einer weit schlechteren Ausgangslage"", erklärte der Spanier, der die Leverkusener übernahm, als sie ein Abstiegskandidat\xa0waren.\nDer umstrittene, weil angeblich kremlnahe Oligarch Alischer Usmanow outet sich als großer Fan des FC Bayern. Zuvor waren Räume des Rekordmeisters und in der Allianz-Arena durchsucht worden - weil Usmanow dort mittels einer Loge Geld gewaschen haben soll.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Jörg Schmitt und Ralf Wiegand\nAlonso, der als Aktiver niemals nach Köpenick reisen musste und die Visite im engen, Tradition verströmenden Stadion nach eigenem Bekunden genoss, konnte überdies darauf verweisen, dass eine wichtige Serie hielt. Leverkusen ist seit nunmehr 14 Spielen ungeschlagen, und darauf war Alonso schon stolz. Die Unioner hatten ihm vorab Respekt abgerungen, nach dem Spiel sah er sich darin bestätigt: ""Heute haben wir (am eigenen Leib) gespürt, warum Union in dieser Saison zuhause ungeschlagen ist"", sagte\xa0er.\nGenau genommen hat Union in der Bundesliga im eigenen Stadion seit Februar 2022 nicht mehr verloren, damals gewann Borussia Dortmund 3:0. Und hätte Union Saint-Gilloise nicht in der Europa League einmal in der Alten Försterei gewonnen, so wäre der Nimbus der Unbezwingbarkeit der Unioner in dieser Spielzeit absolut. Alonso zitierte auch deshalb das Bonmot des Niederländers Johan Cruyff, der wie Alonso mit der Rückennummer 14 berühmt wurde: ""Wenn du nicht gewinnen kannst, musst du wenigstens sicher gehen, dass du nicht\xa0verlierst.""\nEr selbst tat in der Anfangsphase einiges dafür, dass dies gelang. Umständehalber hatte er den nominellen Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba fachfremd auf die Doppelsechs geschoben, und Alonso assistierte ihm durch intensives Coachen so sehr, dass er den halblangen Wintermantel schon nach wenigen Minuten wieder auszog: Fürs Winken war er zu warm und\xa0unbequem.\nErforderlich wurden seine Interventionen, weil die Unioner die Partie entzündeten, kaum, dass sie begonnen hatte. Nach fünf Minuten hielt Sheraldo Becker aus 20 Metern drauf, Lukas Hradecky hatte keine größeren Mühen. Hernach war 04-Verteidiger Kouakou Kossonou zwei Mal in größerer Not zur Stelle: Erst vereitelte er eine Chance Beckers (8. Minute), dann war er gegen Jordan Siebatcheu in extremis parat (10.). Nach und nach fruchteten die Justierungen Alonsos, übernahm Leverkusen eine größere Kontrolle über die Partie. Und das fand Ausdruck in einem Blitzkonter, bei dem Florian Wirtz den Ball auf Moussa Diaby ablegte. Doch der Franzose verfehlte das\xa0Ziel.\nDer Rest der Partie war bei größerem Ballbesitz der Leverkusener vor allem von Taktik geprägt - und der zähen Verteidigungshaltung der Unioner. Die Leverkusener versuchten zwar unentwegt, sich den Gegner zurechtzulegen: Immer wieder verlagerten sie das Spiel. Doch das geriet ein ums andere Mal steril. ""Es ist einfach schwer hier, sich in diesem Stadion durchzukombinieren. Die wissen hier jeden Meter richtig einzuschätzen"", klagte der deutsche Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz, der immer wieder versuchte, durch individuelle Kreativität ein Loch in das defensive Sieb der Köpenicker zu reißen - ohne durchschlagenden\xa0Erfolg.\n""Wir haben gegen die aus meiner Sicht formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten mitgehalten und mitgespielt"", sagte Union-Trainer Urs Fischer (rechts, mit Xabi Alonso).\nDie zweite Halbzeit gebar dann zunächst ein Übergewicht der Unioner. Mittelfeldspieler Aïssa Laïdouni sah sich unvermittelt an der Strafraumgrenze in guter, mittiger Schussposition, doch er verfehlte den Giebel knapp (48.). Becker war dann ein ähnliches Schicksal beschieden, als er sich mit einem Schlenzer aus halblinker Position versuchte. Ansonsten hielt sich die Zahl hochkarätiger Chancen in Grenzen. Nicht, weil die beiden Mannschaften passiv auf den Fehler des Gegners gewartet hätten, in Sachen Initiative waren beide Teams ebenbürtig. Aber: Beide verhielten sich defensiv ähnlich tadellos. Ein einziges Mal nur musste sich Unions Torwart Frederik Rönnow auszeichnen: Bei einem wuchtigen Kopfstoß von Leverkusens Verteidiger Bakker auf Flanke von Jeremie Frimpong (86.) in der Schlussphase, die den Gästen\xa0gehörte.\nWas aus diesem Punkt folgt? Die Resultate der Rivalen im Kampf um einen Platz in einem europäischen Wettbewerb nahmen die Unioner bestenfalls zur Kenntnis. ""Wir schauen auf uns"", sagte Stürmer Sheraldo Becker. Trainer Urs Fischer freute sich darüber, dass sein Team das Umschaltspiel der Leverkusener neutralisieren konnte. Der Gegner habe ""kaum Geschwindigkeit aufnehmen können"", lobte\xa0er.\n""Wir haben gegen die aus meiner Sicht formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten mitgehalten und mitgespielt"", sagte Fischer, und es war ihm anzumerken, dass das für ihn ein Wert an sich war. Alles andere ist Zubrot: Inklusive der Ausbeute von 56 Zählern, die wohl dazu führen wird, dass Union einen neuen, klubeigenen Punkterekord aufstellen wird. Es fehlen dazu - bei vier verbleibenden Spielen - nur noch zwei\xa0Punkte.\nNach dem 1:1 in Bochum richtet sich die Wut des BVB in Richtung Schiedsrichter Stegemann, weil er nach einem Einsteigen gegen Karim Adeyemi keinen Elfmeter pfiff. Stegemann selbst gibt den Fehler zu und erklärt, wie er zur Entscheidung kam.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

"{'content': 'Am ende Applaus nach einer Nullnummer in der Alten Försterei.\n(Foto: IMAGO/Matthias Koch)\nUnion Berlin hat seine Champions-League-Ambitionen gegen formstarke Leverkusener verteidigt - und zugleich die beeindruckende Heimserie ausgebaut. Und auch Freiburg unterstreicht, dass es bei der Verteilung der internationalen Startplätze weiter hohe Ziele hat. Unten gelingt hingegen Stuttgart im Abstiegskampf ein wichtiger Schritt.\nUnion Berlin vs. Bayer 04 Leverkusen 0:0\nAm Ende wurden beide Teams von ihren Fans gefeiert - und das nach einem 0:0. Union Berlin war sehr froh, dass es gegen Bayer Leverkusen - vielleicht die derzeit formstärkste Mannschaft der Bundesliga - zu einem Heimpunkt gereicht hat. ""Es war eine Riesenleistung"", sagte Union-Geschäftsführer Oliver Ruhnert bei Sky. Mit 56 Punkten bleiben die Köpenicker vier Spieltage vor Saisonende auf Rang drei. Zudem blieben sie saisonübergreifend im 21. Liga-Heimspiel ungeschlagen.\nWährend Bayer mit dem eigenen Ballbesitz lange zu wenig anzufangen wusste, waren es die Gastgeber, die blitzschnell konterten. Der umtriebige Sheraldo Becker prüfte erst Bayers Torwart Lukas Hradecky per Fernschuss (5.), ehe er drei Minuten später in höchster Not von Odilon Kossounou (8.) geblockt wurde. Leverkusens Innenverteidiger klärte nur kurz darauf erneut - diesmal gegen Jordan Siebatcheu (11.). Wenn Leverkusen gefährlich wurde, dann meist durch Moussa Diaby, der entweder aus spitzem Winkel drüber zielte (17.) oder den Ball nicht richtig traf (32.).\nAuch unmittelbar nach der Pause war Union das zwingendere Team. Aissa Laidouni (48.) jagte einen abgeblockten Ball zunächst knapp über das Bayer Tor, bevor es für die Gäste so richtig brenzlig wurde: Unions Außenverteidiger Jerome Roussillon dribbelte sich auf der linken Seite stark durch, als Leverkusens Mitchel Bakker erst im letzten vor dem einschussbereiten Laidouni (60.) klären konnte.\n1. FC Köln vs. SC Freiburg 0:1 (0:0)\nDer SC Freiburg ist nur noch vier Schritte von der erstmaligen Champions-League-Teilnahme entfernt. In Köln kamen die Breisgauer zu einem etwas schmeichelhaften 1:0 (0:0). Trotz lange Zeit mäßiger Leistung konnten sich die Breisgauer wieder auf ihre Standard-Stärke verlassen. Der Treffer von Ritsu Doan (54.) nach einem Eckball war der 20. nach einem ruhenden Ball in dieser Saison. Wie glücklich der Sieg war, wusste auch SC-Trainer Christian Streich, der beim Schlusspfiff die Hände vor dem Gesicht zusammenschlug. Die Kölner dürften trotz der Niederlage angesichts von sieben Punkten Vorsprung auf den Relegationsplatz nicht mehr in Abstiegsgefahr geraten.\nGute Laune bei den Trainern aus Freiburg und Köln.\n(Foto: dpa)\nStreich vertraute auf das bewährte Personal und hatte klare Vorgaben für das Spiel: ""Wir offensiv, die offensiv, beide gut spielen – und am Ende gewinnen wir."" Doch so richtig kam das Spiel zunächst in Gange, vor allem die Gäste nicht. Richtig gefährlich wurde es erstmals in der 21. Minute, und das eigentlich ohne Not. SC-Keeper Mark Flekken segelte unter einer Flanke hindurch, den folgenden Schuss von Linton Maina hielt er dafür gut. Und ganz stark parierte der niederländische Nationalkeeper zwei Minuten später einen Kopfball von Eric Martel aus drei Metern.\nVon Freiburg war offensiv indes lange Zeit gar nichts zu sehen, Streich drückte sein Missfallen an dem in der ersten halben Stunde behäbigen Auftritt entsprechend gestenreich aus. Doch die erste Freiburger Gelegenheit war gleich eine riesige. Auch in der Folge entschärfte Köln-Keeper Marvin Schwäbe mehrere Versuche der Gäste. Und dann wurden die Freiburger für ihre verstärkten Bemühungen belohnt. Nach einem Eckball von Christian Günter verlängerte Höler an den langen Pfosten und Doan köpfte aus zwei Metern ungehindert ein. Danach wurde das Spiel etwas munterer. Freiburg hatte weitere Chancen, doch auch die Kölner blieben immer gefährlich. Doch Flekken verhinderte ein Eigentor von Philipp Lienhart , Steffen Tigges schlenzte knapp drüber.\nRB Leipzig vs. TSG Hoffenheim 1:0 (1:0)\nBei Leipzig macht rechtzeitig zum Saisonendspurt Christopher Nkunku wieder den Unterschied aus. Der Franzose krönte sein Startelf-Comeback bei RB mit dem Siegtreffer in der 28. Minute beim 1:0 (1:0) gegen die TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. Die Mannschaft von Marco Rose hat im Kampf um die Champions League weiterhin eine gute Ausgangsposition und kann den direkten Kontrahenten SC Freiburg kommenden Samstag selbst besiegen.\nTorschütze Nkunku mit Gruß an den Sohnemann.\n(Foto: dpa)\nDas Startelf-Comeback vor 45.294 Zuschauern von Nkunku nach mehr als zwei Monaten hätte schon nach 91 Sekunden gekrönt werden können. Erst ließ der quirlige Franzose Ozan Kabak aussteigen, scheiterte dann aber mit seinem schwächeren linken Fuß an Torhüter Oliver Baumann und Kabak, der sich noch dazwischenwarf. Wie schon beim torlosen RB-Auftritt in Leverkusen (0:2) patzten die Sachsen vor dem Tor bei besten Möglichkeiten.\nNach einem Konter konnte der Ex-Hoffenheimer David Raum (26.) nach einem Traumpass von Mohamed Simakan den Abschluss suchen, doch er verpasste den direkten Schuss. Besser machte es Nkunku (28.): Im Zusammenspiel mit Emil Forsberg traf er zur Führung und zückte für seinen Sohn einen roten Luftballon aus dem Stutzen, blies ihn auf und genoss sein erstes Tor in diesem Jahr.\nDie mutlos agierenden Hoffenheimer, die zuletzt unter Pellegrino Matarazzo drei Siege und zehn Punkte aus fünf Spielen holten, kamen erst in der 38. Minute zur ersten richtigen Torchance. Christoph Baumgartner scheiterte am glänzend parierenden RB-Keeper Janis Blaswich. Nach dem Wechsel kam Hoffenheim mit mehr Schwung aus der Kabine, die besseren Chancen hatte aber erneut RB.\nVfB Stuttgart vs. Borussia Mönchengladbach 2:1 (1:0)\nDer VfB Stuttgart hat die Abstiegsränge verlassen. Durch ein 2:1 (1:0) gegen Borussia Mönchengladbach kletterten die Schwaben auf Rang 15 vor dem punktgleichen VfL Bochum. Vor eigenem Publikum hatten die Stuttgarter seit 18. Februar nicht mehr gewonnen. Den verdienten Sieg bescherte dem VfB ein von Tanguy Coulibaly verwandelter Elfmeter (83.) - Gladbachs Kou Itakura sah für das Foul an Tiago Tomas die Rote Karte (82.). Durch ein lange überprüftes Tor des guten Serhou Guirassy (22.) war Stuttgart zunächst in Führung gegangen, den Ausgleich hatte Julian Weigl per Handelfmeter erzielt (78.). Durch den Sieg stehen die Gastgeber erstmals seit dem 23. Spieltag nicht mehr auf einem der letzten drei Plätze.\nGladbach braucht zu lange, um gegen Stuttgart auf Touren zu kommen.\n(Foto: dpa)\nStuttgart bestimmte vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit das Spiel gegen schlampige Gladbacher. Was aber zunächst fehlte, waren gute Torchancen. Das änderte sich jedoch nach 20 Minuten schlagartig. Erst musste sich Gladbachs Torhüter Jonas Omlin bei einem Schuss von Millot lang machen. Kurz darauf lenkte Guirassy den Ball auf Vorlage von Waldemar Anton mit der Hacke ins Tor, nach zweiminütiger Videoüberprüfung zählte der Treffer dann auch.\nErst danach nahmen die Gladbacher entschlossener am Spiel teil, was die wackelige Stuttgarter Abwehr prompt in Schwierigkeiten brachte. VfB-Torhüter Fabian Bredlow verhinderte gegen Alassane Plea mit einer Glanzparade den raschen Ausgleich (33.). Der VfB verpasste danach mehrere Chancen, die Führung auszubauen. Nach einem unbeabsichtigten Schlag ins Gesicht von Gladbachs Lars Stindl (51.) musste der umtriebige Torschütze Guirassy vom Feld, ersetzt wurde er von Tiago Tomas. In der Folge zog sich der VfB zunehmend zurück, hatte aber dennoch die Gelegenheit, die Führung auszubauen.\nEintracht Frankfurt vs. FC Augsburg 1:1 (1:0)\nEintracht Frankfurt hat die Negativserie mit dem 1:1 (1:0) gegen den FC Augsburg auf neun sieglose Bundesligaspiele verlängert. Die Chance auf den erneuten Einzug in einen Europacup-Wettbewerb ist damit weiter gesunken Nach der Führung für die Hessen durch ein Eigentor von Elvis Rexhbecaj (25. Minute, konnte Ermedin Demirovic (58.) mit einem sehenswerten Treffer den Ausgleich vor 50.000 Zuschauern erzielen.\nDie lange Durststrecke seit Mitte Februar, als zuletzt ein Sieg gegen Werder Bremen (2:0) gelungen war, hat bei den Frankfurtern Spuren und Verunsicherung hinterlassen. Der Spielaufbau war erneut mühsam und zäh - und sehenswerte Kombinationen Mangelware. Außerdem musste die Eintracht noch den Ausfall von Mittelfeld-Dauerläufer Djibril Sow verkraften, der kurz vor dem Anpfiff wegen Unwohlsein nicht spielen konnte.\nAuch die gegen den Abstieg kämpfenden, lange Zeit harmlosen Gäste, die aus den vorherigen zehn Auswärtspartien nur zwei Punkte holten, hatten in der Offensive so gut wie nichts zu bieten. Nach dem Seitenwechsel machten die Gäste mehr Dampf. In der 48. Minute lenkte Nationaltorwart Kevin Trapp einen Schuss mit den Fingerspitzen noch zur Ecke. Machtlos war Trapp zehn Minuten danach gegen den 25-jährigen Angreifer, der den Ball bei einer Flanke von Ruben Vargas volley ins Frankfurter Gehäuse weiterleitete.\nQuelle: ntv.de, jwu/sid/dpa'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Gegen Leverkusen gibt es ein torloses Remis. Die Abwehrreihen halten dicht. Der Vorsprung auf Platz fünf wird jedoch kleiner.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtn-b7itf\nDer 1. FC Union Berlin und Bayer 04 Leverkusen haben ihre Serien ausgebaut, eine Nullnummer in der Alten Försterei hilft beiden auf dem Weg in die internationalen Ligen aber nur bedingt. In einem intensiven Spiel kamen die Eisernen am Samstag trotz guter Chancen im 21. ungeschlagenen Heimspiel nacheinander in der Fußball-Bundesliga nicht über ein 0:0 hinaus.\nDie Gäste aus Leverkusen wiederum vermochten im 14. Pflichtspiel nacheinander ohne Niederlage, ihre Spielanteile nicht in Torchancen zu verwandeln. In der Tabelle bleibt Union Dritter und Leverkusen Sechster. Die Konkurrenz um die Champions und um die Europa League rückt näher. „Ich bin ein bisschen enttäuscht, hätte gerne heute hier gewonnen“, sagte Bayers Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz, „wir haben wenige Chancen bekommen. Es ist aber ein verdientes Ergebnis.“\nLeverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso hatte den Gegner nicht umsonst vorher schon gelobt und vom verdienten Tabellenplatz der Unioner gesprochen. Nach nicht mal acht Minuten im Köpenicker Stimmungstempel zog sich der frühere spanische Profi schon den Kurzmantel aus – Zeit für Schwerstarbeit für sich und seine Mannschaft vor 22.012 Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauern in der Alten Försterei. Alonso gestikulierte am Rand, seine Spieler versuchten irgendwie, auf dem Rasen mit dem Kraftfußball der Eisernen klarzukommen.\nUnion dominierte erstmal. 20 Heimspiele ohne Niederlage und die Aussicht auf die europäische Meisterklasse haben das Selbstvertrauen der Mannschaft von Urs Fischer nur noch weiter gestärkt. Was fehlte, war ein Tor. Sheraldo Becker zweimal (5., 8. Minute), danach zweimal der für den gelb gesperrten Kevin Behrens ins Team gerückte Jordan Siebatcheu (9., 11.) – Chancen waren da für eine frühe Führung.\nIm Gegensatz zu den Leverkusenern. Daran vermochte auch die Rückkehr von Nationalspieler und Super-Talent Florian Wirtz nichts zu ändern, der 19-Jährige hat seine Magen-Darm-Probleme überwunden. Gegen die robuste und körperliche Union-Defensive tat aber auch er sich zunächst schwer. Bayers gefährlichste Szene leitete bemerkenswerterweise der ehemalige Unioner Robert Andrich mit einer Balleroberung noch in der Berliner Hälfte ein, der Schuss von Moussa Diaby ging aber drüber. Zweidrittel Ballbesitz nützten den Leverkusenern in der ersten Halbzeit auch nichts, sie blieben zu harmlos.\nMit ein bisschen Verzögerung initiierten die Gastgeber, die in diesem Jahr schon gegen den FC Schalke 04 und den 1. FC Köln 0:0 und den VfL Bochum 1:1 daheim gespielt hatten, zumindest eine kurzzeitige ähnliche Drangphase nach der Pause wie zu Spielbeginn. Aissa Laidouni (48.), und Becker (59.) trafen aber wieder nicht. Zwischendurch hatte Frederik Rönnow im Unioner Tor vor Diaby (52.) retten müssen, gegen die dichte Verteidigung der Berliner kam die Bayer-Elf aber weiter und trotz einer Passquote von phasenweise 90 Prozent einfach kaum durch.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nAlle Infos und Themen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF.A.Z.-Sonderseite zu Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlle Teams im Überblick\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie aktuelle Tabelle der Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlles in der Übersicht\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpielplan der Bundesliga: Termine, Ergebnisse, Partien\nAlonso reagierte und brachte die beiden frischen Stürmer Amine Adli und Sardar Azmoun. Fischer reagierte auch, wechselte Mittelfeldmann Laidouni aus und verhalf Andras Schäfer zum Comeback nach drei Monaten Zwangspause wegen einer Fußverletzung. Sollte doch noch ein spätes Tor für einen Sieger sorgen? Auch Fischer schickte weitere neue Kräfte im Mittelfeld und Angriff aufs Feld.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 5 min\nSepp van den Berg feiert den zwischenzeitlichen Ausgleich\nDie Gelsenkirchener treffen gegen Bremen in der Nachspielzeit und holen drei extrem wichtige Punkte im Abstiegskampf, Freiburg und Leipzig gewinnen im Streben um die Champions-League-Plätze. Das Wichtigste zum Spieltag.\nVon Anna Dreher, Gerald Kleffmann und Martin Schneider\nFC Schalke 04 - SV Werder Bremen 1:1 (0:1), Tore: 0:1 Marvin Ducksch (18.), 1:1 Sepp van den Berg (81.), 2:1 Dominick Drexler (90.+2)\nDie Lage war vor dem Spiel ernst: Durch den Sieg des VfB Stuttgart und durch das höllisch schwere Restprogramm mit drei Auswärtsspielen in Mainz, München und Leipzig (und einem Heimspiel gegen Frankfurt) musste der FC Schalke 04 dieses Heimspiel gegen Bremen faktisch gewinnen, um noch auf den Klassenverbleib hoffen zu dürfen. Und als Dominick Drexler in der Nachspielzeit erst den Bremer Siegtreffer mit einer Blockaktion verhinderte und kurz darauf das 2:1 für Schalke selbst schoss - da bebte die Arena dem Anlass\xa0entsprechend.\nDie Partie begann aus königsblauer Sicht zunächst maximal unglücklich, denn Bremen nutzte seine erste Chance zur Führung. Nach einem Ballverlust kombinierten sich die Norddeutschen durch die ungeordnete Schalker Defensive, Marvin Ducksch traf erneut in Abwesenheit von Top-Torschütze Niclas Füllkrug. Schalke kam mit Mut aus der Kabine, Werder Torwart Jiri Pavlenka parierte einen strammen Fernschuss von Marius Bülter, dann traf Tom Krauß die Latte. Aber erst der eingewechselte Sepp van den Berg, der seit Oktober verletzt gefehlt hatte, erzielte den Ausgleich, den das ganze Stadion herbei bibberte. Und nach Drexlers Siegtreffer lagen sich alle Blauen in den Armen. Schalke muss trotzdem aus den restlichen vier Spielen Punkte holen. Aber die Hoffnung, sie fliegt noch durch die Luft im Norden von\xa0Gelsenkirchen.\nVfB Stuttgart - Borussia Mönchengladbach 2:1 (1:0), Tore: 1:0 Serhou Guirassy (22.), 1:1 Julian Weigl (78., Handelfmeter), 2:1 Tanguy Coulibaly (83., Foulelfmeter)\nVor der Partie hatte Fabian Wohlgemuth, Sportdirektor des VfB Stuttgart, über Serhou Guirassy gesagt: ""In den letzten Spielen hat man gesehen, wie wichtig er für uns ist."" Am Samstag gegen Borussia Mönchengladbach erhielt Wohlgemut den nächsten Beleg dafür. Nach einer Ecke bekamen die Gladbacher den Ball nicht weg, der Ball landete bei Guirassy, der per Hacke zum 1:0 traf. Das Tor in der 22. Minute wurde auf Abseits überprüft - markierte dann aber den Grundstein für die vierte Partie ohne Niederlage unter Trainer Sebastian\xa0Hoeneß.\nAus den nächsten Chancen konnte keine Mannschaft etwas verwertbares machen, bis das Spiel noch kurios wurde. Nach Handspiel von Dan-Axel Zagadou gab es einen Elfmeter für Gladbach, den Julian Weigl zum 1:1 verwandelte. Arg lange mussten die VfB-Anhänger dem vermeintlich verlorenen Sieg aber nicht nachtrauern. Denn nur zwei Minuten später ging Tiago Tomas im Zweikampf mit Kō Itakura zu Boden - und es gab den nächsten Elfmeter. Der VAR überprüfte auch diese Szene, Itakura wurde des Feldes verwiesen - und Tanguy Coulibaly traf problemlos zum 2:1-Endstand. Dank des ersten Heimsiegs seit Mitte Februar sind die Stuttgarter nun auf Platz 15 gerutscht, der Klassenverbleib erscheint wieder\xa0wahrscheinlicher.\nRB Leipzig - TSG Hoffenheim 1:0 (1:0), Tor: 1:0 Christopher Nkunku (28.)\nWenig überraschend war Leipzig, weiterhin Aspirant auf einen Champions-League-Platz, die deutlich bessere Mannschaft. Vor allem Christopher Nkunku wurde immer wieder in der Spitze bedient. Der französische Stürmer war nach einem Muskelfaserriss im linken Oberschenkel erstmals seit dem 23. Spieltag wieder so fit, dass er in der Startelf beginnen konnte. Eine erste Großchance vergab Nkunku noch, doch in der 27. Minute nahm er im Sprint einen Steckpass von Emil Forsberg auf und schob mit einem Linksschuss den Ball rechts unten ein. Hoffenheim, das gegen den Abstieg kämpft, fiel mit zwei, drei passabel vorgetragenen Offensivaktionen auf, doch wirkte\xa0harmlos.\nDer umstrittene, weil angeblich kremlnahe Oligarch Alischer Usmanow outet sich als großer Fan des FC Bayern. Zuvor waren Räume des Rekordmeisters und in der Allianz-Arena durchsucht worden - weil Usmanow dort mittels einer Loge Geld gewaschen haben soll.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Jörg Schmitt und Ralf Wiegand\nIn der zweiten Halbzeit versuchte es Hoffenheim mit einer anderen Attitüde, stand höher, griff die Leipziger schon in deren Spielhälfte an, versuchte dem Gastgeber zuzusetzen. Gefährlich agierte die TSG jedoch kaum. Munas Dabbur fiel einmal mit einem Schlenzer aus 20 Metern auf. Im Bewusstsein des knappen Vorsprungs intensivierte RB seine Bemühungen nach vorne, Zählbares entsprang allerdings nicht mehr. Hoffenheim verteidigte immerhin solide, aber die Niederlage entspannt natürlich die angespannte Lage in der Tabelle kein bisschen. Leipzig bleibt nach dem Sieg im Rennen um eine\xa0Champions-League-Teilnahme.\n1. FC Union Berlin - Bayer 04 Leverkusen 0:0\nDie große Frage vor diesem Spiel war: Welche Kraft ist die größere?

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 5 min\nSepp van den Berg feiert den zwischenzeitlichen Ausgleich\nDie Gelsenkirchener treffen gegen Bremen in der Nachspielzeit und holen drei extrem wichtige Punkte im Abstiegskampf, Freiburg und Leipzig gewinnen im Streben um die Champions-League-Plätze. Das Wichtigste zum Spieltag.\nVon Anna Dreher, Gerald Kleffmann und Martin Schneider\nFC Schalke 04 - SV Werder Bremen 1:1 (0:1), Tore: 0:1 Marvin Ducksch (18.), 1:1 Sepp van den Berg (81.), 2:1 Dominick Drexler (90.+2)\nDie Lage war vor dem Spiel ernst: Durch den Sieg des VfB Stuttgart und durch das höllisch schwere Restprogramm mit drei Auswärtsspielen in Mainz, München und Leipzig (und einem Heimspiel gegen Frankfurt) musste der FC Schalke 04 dieses Heimspiel gegen Bremen faktisch gewinnen, um noch auf den Klassenverbleib hoffen zu dürfen. Und als Dominick Drexler in der Nachspielzeit erst den Bremer Siegtreffer mit einer Blockaktion verhinderte und kurz darauf das 2:1 für Schalke selbst schoss - da bebte die Arena dem Anlass\xa0entsprechend.\nDie Partie begann aus königsblauer Sicht zunächst maximal unglücklich, denn Bremen nutzte seine erste Chance zur Führung. Nach einem Ballverlust kombinierten sich die Norddeutschen durch die ungeordnete Schalker Defensive, Marvin Ducksch traf erneut in Abwesenheit von Top-Torschütze Niclas Füllkrug. Schalke kam mit Mut aus der Kabine, Werder Torwart Jiri Pavlenka parierte einen strammen Fernschuss von Marius Bülter, dann traf Tom Krauß die Latte. Aber erst der eingewechselte Sepp van den Berg, der seit Oktober verletzt gefehlt hatte, erzielte den Ausgleich, den das ganze Stadion herbei bibberte. Und nach Drexlers Siegtreffer lagen sich alle Blauen in den Armen. Schalke muss trotzdem aus den restlichen vier Spielen Punkte holen. Aber die Hoffnung, sie fliegt noch durch die Luft im Norden von\xa0Gelsenkirchen.\nVfB Stuttgart - Borussia Mönchengladbach 2:1 (1:0), Tore: 1:0 Serhou Guirassy (22.), 1:1 Julian Weigl (78., Handelfmeter), 2:1 Tanguy Coulibaly (83., Foulelfmeter)\nVor der Partie hatte Fabian Wohlgemuth, Sportdirektor des VfB Stuttgart, über Serhou Guirassy gesagt: ""In den letzten Spielen hat man gesehen, wie wichtig er für uns ist."" Am Samstag gegen Borussia Mönchengladbach erhielt Wohlgemut den nächsten Beleg dafür. Nach einer Ecke bekamen die Gladbacher den Ball nicht weg, der Ball landete bei Guirassy, der per Hacke zum 1:0 traf. Das Tor in der 22. Minute wurde auf Abseits überprüft - markierte dann aber den Grundstein für die vierte Partie ohne Niederlage unter Trainer Sebastian\xa0Hoeneß.\nAus den nächsten Chancen konnte keine Mannschaft etwas verwertbares machen, bis das Spiel noch kurios wurde. Nach Handspiel von Dan-Axel Zagadou gab es einen Elfmeter für Gladbach, den Julian Weigl zum 1:1 verwandelte. Arg lange mussten die VfB-Anhänger dem vermeintlich verlorenen Sieg aber nicht nachtrauern. Denn nur zwei Minuten später ging Tiago Tomas im Zweikampf mit Kō Itakura zu Boden - und es gab den nächsten Elfmeter. Der VAR überprüfte auch diese Szene, Itakura wurde des Feldes verwiesen - und Tanguy Coulibaly traf problemlos zum 2:1-Endstand. Dank des ersten Heimsiegs seit Mitte Februar sind die Stuttgarter nun auf Platz 15 gerutscht, der Klassenverbleib erscheint wieder\xa0wahrscheinlicher.\nRB Leipzig - TSG Hoffenheim 1:0 (1:0), Tor: 1:0 Christopher Nkunku (28.)\nWenig überraschend war Leipzig, weiterhin Aspirant auf einen Champions-League-Platz, die deutlich bessere Mannschaft. Vor allem Christopher Nkunku wurde immer wieder in der Spitze bedient. Der französische Stürmer war nach einem Muskelfaserriss im linken Oberschenkel erstmals seit dem 23. Spieltag wieder so fit, dass er in der Startelf beginnen konnte. Eine erste Großchance vergab Nkunku noch, doch in der 27. Minute nahm er im Sprint einen Steckpass von Emil Forsberg auf und schob mit einem Linksschuss den Ball rechts unten ein. Hoffenheim, das gegen den Abstieg kämpft, fiel mit zwei, drei passabel vorgetragenen Offensivaktionen auf, doch wirkte\xa0harmlos.\nDer umstrittene, weil angeblich kremlnahe Oligarch Alischer Usmanow outet sich als großer Fan des FC Bayern. Zuvor waren Räume des Rekordmeisters und in der Allianz-Arena durchsucht worden - weil Usmanow dort mittels einer Loge Geld gewaschen haben soll.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Jörg Schmitt und Ralf Wiegand\nIn der zweiten Halbzeit versuchte es Hoffenheim mit einer anderen Attitüde, stand höher, griff die Leipziger schon in deren Spielhälfte an, versuchte dem Gastgeber zuzusetzen. Gefährlich agierte die TSG jedoch kaum. Munas Dabbur fiel einmal mit einem Schlenzer aus 20 Metern auf. Im Bewusstsein des knappen Vorsprungs intensivierte RB seine Bemühungen nach vorne, Zählbares entsprang allerdings nicht mehr. Hoffenheim verteidigte immerhin solide, aber die Niederlage entspannt natürlich die angespannte Lage in der Tabelle kein bisschen. Leipzig bleibt nach dem Sieg im Rennen um eine\xa0Champions-League-Teilnahme.\n1. FC Union Berlin - Bayer 04 Leverkusen 0:0\nDie große Frage vor diesem Spiel war: Welche Kraft ist die größere? Union Berlins kolossale Heimstärke, die es noch keinem Bundesligisten in dieser Saison erlaubte, drei Punkte an der Alten Försterei zu gewinnen? Oder Leverkusens fast schon gruseliges Formhoch, die letzte Niederlage gab es am 19. Februar?

"{'content': 'Der 1. FC Union hat im Spitzenspiel die besseren Chancen, kann jedoch keinen weiteren großen Schritt Richtung Champions League machen.\n29.04.2023, 17:32\xa0Uhr | Update: 29.04.2023, 18:32\xa0Uhr\nDie Ecke hatte Jeremie Frimpong hereingeschlagen, den Kopfball brachte Mitchel Bakker aufs Tor. Dieser stellte für Frederik Rönnow, den Torwart des 1. FC Union, jedoch keine große Herausforderung dar. Bemerkenswert war die Szene trotzdem: Es war das erste Mal im Spiel gegen Bayer Leverkusen, dass Rönnow richtig eingreifen musste. In der 86. Minute.\nDa Union ebenfalls nicht sonderlich viele Gelegenheiten gehabt hatte, gab es bis dahin keine Tore. Und auch danach nicht. „Für mich war es ein intensives, tolles 0:0-Spiel“, sagte Unions Trainer Urs Fischer: „Wir haben gegen die derzeit formstärkste Mannschaft der Liga über 90 Minuten gut mitgehalten und mitgespielt.“\nUnion war nach vorn die aktivere Mannschaft und hatte die besseren Chancen. Trotzdem überwog am Ende die Zufriedenheit über den geholten Punkt: „Gegen eine solch offensivstarke Mannschaft ohne Gegentor zu bleiben, ist schon eine Auszeichnung“, sagte Verteidiger Robin Knoche.\nWer weiß, wofür dieses Unentschieden noch gut ist, wenn die Saison in vier Wochen endet. „In der Endabrechnung kann dir vielleicht jeder Punkt helfen“, sagte Fischer. Erst einmal ist der Vorsprung des Tabellendritten in Sachen Champions-League-Ränge allerdings geschmolzen, da die Verfolger SC Freiburg und RB Leipzig jeweils 1:0 beim 1. FC Köln beziehungsweise gegen die TSG Hoffenheim gewannen. Doch zumindest hält Union den Sechsten Bayer weiter acht Punkte auf Distanz.\nBeide Serien hielten am Sonnabend im ausverkauften Stadion An der Alten Försterei vor 22.012 Fans: Union bleibt weiter seit Mitte Februar 2022 in der Fußball-Bundesliga zu Hause ungeschlagen. Leverkusen ist nun wettbewerbsübergreifend 14 Pflichtspiele nacheinander ohne Niederlage.\nIm Vergleich zum komplett überzeugenden Auftritt zuletzt bei Borussia Mönchengladbach veränderte Trainer Fischer sein Team nur auf einer Position. Für den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens spielte Jordan Siebatcheu von Beginn an. Bei den Gästen war neben Edmond Tapsoba nach überstandenem Magen-Darm-Infekt auch wieder Florian Wirtz dabei.\nUnion: Rönnow - Doekhi, Knoche, Leite - Laidouni (69. Schäfer), Haberer (78. Thorsby) - Juranovic, Khedira, Roussillon (90. Gießelmann) - Siebatcheu (78. S. Michel), S. BeckerLeverkusen: Hradecky - Kossounou, Tah, Hincapié - Frimpong, Andrich, Tapsoba, Bakker - Hlozek (62. Azmoun), Diaby (62. Adli), Wirtz.Schiedsrichter: Fritz.Zuschauer: 22.012 (ausverkauft)\nWirtz war es auch, der die erste vielversprechende Vorwärtsbewegung der Gäste einleitete. Nach seinem Zuspiel in der 17. Minute verzog Moussa Diaby. Bis dahin hatte nur Union gespielt und in einer stürmischen Anfangsphase mehrere gute Gelegenheiten gehabt. Doch Bayers Abwehrspieler Odilon Kossounou klärte zweimal in letzter Sekunde und ein Kopfball von Jordan fand nicht sein Ziel.\nAb Mitte der ersten Hälfte verlor die Begegnung deutlich an Tempo. Union stand hinten sehr sicher. Bayer kam nach vorn weiterhin so gut wie gar nicht zum Zuge, sorgte nur bei Kontern mitunter für Gefahr. Bei der besten Chance traf Diaby nach Zuspiel von Mitchel Bakker den Ball nicht richtig. Kurz vor der Pause rutschte Frimpong in aussichtsreicher Position beim Versuch weg, den Ball anzunehmen.\nWie die erste begann auch die zweite Hälfte recht flott. Diesmal mit, allerdings eher Halbchancen auf beiden Seiten. Ab der 60. Minute waren die Gastgeber erneut die zielstrebigere Mannschaft, kamen meist über die linke Seite. Am nächsten dran am Führungstreffer war Becker, dessen Schlenzer am rechten Pfosten vorbei flog. Danach tat sich in der Nähe beider Tore wieder äußerst wenig.\nErst in der Schlussphase drehte Bayer etwas auf, außer beim Kopfball von Bakker musste Torwart Rönnow aber nicht eingreifen. So fand nicht nur Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso: „Das Unentschieden ist ein faires Ergebnis.“\n\nZur Startseite\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster'}",Moussa Diaby,de
"{'content': 'Der 1. FC Union Berlin und Bayer 04 Leverkusen haben ihre Serien ausgebaut, eine Nullnummer in der Alten Försterei hilft beiden auf dem Weg in die internationalen Ligen aber nur bedingt.\nIn einem intensiven Spiel kamen die Eisernen am Samstag trotz guter Chancen im 21. ungeschlagenen Heimspiel nacheinander in der Fußball-Bundesliga nicht über ein 0:0 hinaus. Die Gäste aus Leverkusen wiederum vermochten im 14. Pflichtspiel nacheinander ohne Niederlage, ihre Spielanteile nicht in Torchancen zu verwandeln. In der Tabelle bleibt Union Dritter und Leverkusen Sechster. Die Konkurrenz um die Champions und um die Europa League rückt näher.\nLeverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso hatte den Gegner nicht umsonst vorher schon gelobt und vom verdienten Tabellenplatz der Unioner gesprochen. Nach nicht mal acht Minuten im Köpenicker Stimmungstempel zog sich der spanische Ex-Profi schon den Kurzmantel aus - Zeit für Schwerstarbeit für sich und seine Mannschaft vor 22.012 Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauern in der Alten Försterei. Alonso gestikulierte am Rand, seine Spieler versuchten irgendwie, auf dem Rasen mit dem Kraft-Fußball der Eisernen klarzukommen.\nUnion dominiert, trifft aber nicht\nUnion dominierte erstmal. 20 Heimspiele ohne Niederlage und die Aussicht auf die europäische Meisterklasse haben das Selbstvertrauen der Mannschaft von Urs Fischer nur noch weiter gestärkt. Was fehlte, war ein Tor. Sheraldo Becker zweimal (5., 8.), danach zweimal der für den gelb gesperrten Kevin Behrens ins Team gerückte Jordan Siebatcheu (9., 11.) - Chancen waren da für eine frühe Führung.\nIm Gegensatz zu den Leverkusenern. Daran vermochte auch die Rückkehr von Nationalspieler und Super-Talent Florian Wirtz nichts zu ändern, der 19-Jährige hat seine Magen-Darm-Probleme überwunden. Gegen die robuste und körperliche Union-Defensive tat aber auch er sich zunächst schwer.\nBayers gefährlichste Szene leitete bemerkenswerterweise der ehemalige Unioner Robert Andrich mit einer Balleroberung noch in der Berliner Hälfte ein, der Schuss von Moussa Diaby ging aber drüber. Zweidrittel Ballbesitz nützten den Leverkusenern in der ersten Halbzeit auch nichts, sie blieben zu harmlos.\nMit ein bisschen Verzögerung initiierten die Gastgeber, die in diesem Jahr schon gegen den FC Schalke 04 und den 1. FC Köln 0:0 und den VfL Bochum 1:1 daheim gespielt hatten, zumindest eine kurzzeitige ähnliche Drangphase nach der Pause wie zu Spielbeginn. Aissa Laidouni (48.), und Becker (59.) trafen aber wieder nicht. Zwischendurch hatte Frederik Rönnow im Unioner Tor vor Diaby (52.) retten müssen, gegen die dichte Verteidigung der Berliner kam die Bayer-Elf aber weiter und trotz einer Passquote von phasenweise 90 Prozent einfach kaum durch.\nAlonso reagierte und brachte die beiden frischen Stürmer Amine Adli und Sardar Azmoun. Fischer reagierte auch, wechselte Mittelfeldmann Laidouni aus und verhalf Andras Schäfer zum Comeback nach drei Monaten Zwangspause wegen einer Fußverletzung. Sollte doch noch ein spätes Tor für einen Sieger sorgen? Auch Fischer schickte weitere neue Kräfte im Mittelfeld und Angriff aufs Feld.

"{'content': 'Für Jordan Siebatcheu, Stürmer von Union Berlin, ist bei Leverkusens Torwart Lukas Hradecky Endstation.\nFoto:\xa0JOHN MACDOUGALL / AFP\nUnion bleibt trotz der Nullnummer gegen Bayer Leverkusen auf Champions-League-Kurs. Trainer Fischer: „Das war ein gewonnener Punkt.“\nBerlin.\xa0 Die berühmte Frage, ob dieses torlose Unentschieden für Union Berlin nun ein Punktgewinn oder zwei verlorene Zähler seien, wussten die Profis des Berliner Fußball-Bundesligisten kaum eindeutig einzuschätzen. „Zu Null zu spielen gegen eine so offensivstarke Mannschaft ist schon eine Auszeichnung“, sagte Robin Knoche. Als Abwehrchef kommt er um diese Aussage praktisch gar nicht herum.\nDann ist da Sheraldo Becker, seines Zeichens Stürmer von Union Berlin, und mit ihm ein nicht ganz so positives Urteil über das 0:0 gegen Bayer Leverkusen am Sonnabend. „Wir haben uns nicht belohnt, hätten ein, zwei Tore machen müssen“, sagte Becker. Er selbst hatte sich immer wieder in gute Positionen gespielt.\nSchließlich versuchte sich Trainer Urs Fischer an einer Analyse. „Meine Mannschaft hat das über 90 Minuten sehr gut gemacht. Gerade dieses Umschaltspiel von Leverkusen konnten wir neutralisieren. Von daher bekommt die Mannschaft ein dickes Lob. Auf Grund der Art und Weise ist es ein gewonnener Punkt.“\nUnion Berlin hat den Vereinsrekord von 21 Bundesliga-Heimspielen in Folge ohne Niederlage eingestellt. Und was die Champions-League-Träume an der Alten Försterei angeht, so ist dieses Remis gegen die „Werkself“ ohne Zweifel ein kleiner Rückschlag angesichts der Siege der Verfolger SC Freiburg (1:0 beim 1. FC Köln) und RB Leipzig (1:0 gegen die TSG Hoffenheim).\nFür das ausgerufene Ziel – erneute Teilnahme am internationalen Wettbewerb – war dieser eine Punkt gegen Leverkusen Gold wert. Union hat als Tabellendritter die Leverkusener (Rang sechs) mit acht Punkten auf Distanz gehalten. Soll heißen: Zumindest die Europa League ist bei nur noch vier ausstehenden Spielen und zwölf zu vergebenen Punkten zum Greifen nah.\nKompakt und organisiert sollte die Mannschaft agieren. Das hatte Trainer Fischer seinen Spielern mit auf den Weg gegeben. „Auch Restverteidigung wird ein Thema sein. Es braucht kurze Abstände, du musst da sein, um zu unterstützen“, sagte Fischer im Vorfeld.\nNur eines sollte nicht passieren, so der Union-Coach: „Wenn wir beginnen, abwartend zu spielen, hat uns das noch nie geholfen. Wir tun gut daran, von der ersten Minuten an aktiv im Spiel zu sein und uns auch mit dem Ball etwas zuzutrauen.“\nUnion agierte organisiert und solidarisch. Und der Tabellendritte traute sich auch etwas zu. Mit Jordan Siebatcheu als Ersatz für den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens, ansonsten lief das gleiche Team auf, das vor einer Woche bei Borussia Mönchengladbach 1:0 gewonnen hatte.\nUnaufgeregt, aber hellwach beim Verteidigen des eigenen Tores, dafür umso explosiver nach Ballgewinnen, wenn es in Richtung des Leverkusener Kastens ging. Viel lief dabei erwartungsgemäß über Sheraldo Becker, der von Bayers Odilon Kossounou geblockt (8.) wurde und dessen Flanke drei Minuten später Siebatcheu nur knapp verfehlte (11.).\nLeverkusen? Erstaunlich abwartend, wenngleich fußballerisch klar überlegen. Florian Wirtz, Mitchel Bakker, natürlich Moussa Diaby, dahinter Ex-Unioner Robert Andrich als aggressive leader wussten zu wirbeln. Und sie kamen zu Chancen durch Diaby, einmal von Witz in Szene gesetzt (17., Haberer hatte den Ball zuvor an Andrich verloren), einmal von Bakker (32., Jerome Roussillon konnte klären).\nNach dem Seitenwechsel erhöhte Union die Schlagzahl. Aissa Laidouni (48.), Becker (59.) und Siebatcheu (60.), der den gelbgesperrten Kevin Behrens ersetzte, kamen zu Chancen. Ein Tor wollte jedoch nicht gelingen.\nUnd natürlich legte auch Leverkusen noch einen Gang zu, drückte Union in der Schlussphase an den eigenen Strafraum. Dennoch sprang nur ein Kopfball von Bakker heraus, den Union-Torwart Frederik Rönnow in höchster Not parieren konnte (86.). Es war die größte, weil einzige Chance der Leverkusener, bei denen der Union-Schlussmann eingreifen musste.\n„Am Ende des Spiels musst du dann auch clever genug und mit einem Punkt zufrieden sein. In der Endabrechnung kann dir so ein Punkt noch helfen“, sagte Fischer zum Abschluss. Sein Abwehrchef Knoche schlug schließlich in dieselbe Kerbe: „Ich habe immer gesagt, jeder Punkt hilft uns.“\nEs war kein Geringerer als Bayer-Coach Xabi Alonso, der bei seinem ersten Besuch in der Alten Försterei jene Worte sprach, die aus der Nullnummer einen Punktgewinn für Union machen. „Union hat zu Hause in dieser Saison noch nicht verloren.

"{'content': 'Leverkusens Edmond Tapsoba (l) und Berlins Sheraldo Becker kämpfen um den Ball.\nFoto:\xa0Marius Becker/dpa\nUnion ist aus dem Hinspiel gewarnt. Gegen Bayer Leverkusen sucht Union-Trainer Fischer nach dem richtigen Mittel, die imposante Heimserie aufrechtzuerhalten.\nBerlin.\xa0Fußball-Bundesligist 1. FC Union Berlin ist vor dem kommenden Heimspiel auf der Suche nach der richtigen Balance. „Schauen wir mal, ob es ein Geduldspiel wird. Ich glaube schon“, sagte Union-Trainer Urs Fischer am Donnerstag vor der samstäglichen Begegnung des 30. Spieltags gegen Bayer Leverkusen im Stadion An der Alten Försterei (15.30 Uhr/Sky). Neben der Geduld blickt der 57-Jährige vor allem auf die schnellen Spieler in den Reihen der Rheinländer, die beim 5:0 im Hinspiel den Berlinern die bisher höchste Saisonniederlage zugefügt hatten: „Da kommt eine enorme Geschwindigkeit auf uns zu.“\nDabei schaut der Schweizer nicht nur auf Moussa Diaby, der bereits fünf Tore in den bisherigen sieben Bundesligaduellen gegen Union bejubeln durfte. Auch Jeremie Frimpong oder Amine Adli gehören zu den schnellsten Spielern in der Bundesliga. „Es braucht kurze Abstände und jeder muss bereit sein, den anderen zu unterstützen. Bist du da nicht drauf, hat Leverkusen eine zu hohe Geschwindigkeit. Dann wird es schwierig zu verteidigen“, sagte Fischer, der das Team des Spaniers Xabi Alonso als derzeit „formstärkste Mannschaft“ adelte, die seit 13 Pflichtspielen nicht mehr verloren hat.\nAngesichts der Tabellenkonstellation des seit 20 Heimspielen ungeschlagenen Tabellendritten gegen den sechstplatzierten Gast aus Leverkusen könnten die Gäste mehr Spielanteile für sich behaupten, was der Spielweise der Unioner zugutekäme und die Frage nach der Geduld beantwortet. Wobei Fischer Geduld nicht mit Abwarten verwechseln möchte. „Wenn wir abwartend beginnen zu spielen, das hat uns das noch nie geholfen. Die zweite Hälfte gegen Bochum war zu viel abwartend“, sagt der Trainer rückblickend auf vorherige Heimspiel beim 1:1 gegen den Abstiegskandidaten, „wir tun gut daran, von der ersten Minute an aktiv zu sein. Am Schluss haben wir ein Heimspiel, das wir gewinnen wollen.“'}",Moussa Diaby,de

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 2 min\nJeremie Frimpong bekommt Glückwünsche seines Trainers Xabi Alonso - in Leverkusen haben sie derzeit gute Laune.\nSeit zwei Monaten keine Niederlage und viel Energie: Leverkusen beweist beim 2:0 gegen Leipzig, dass es unter Xabi Alonso immer besser läuft - bei RB häufen sich dagegen Befürchtungen.\nVon Ulrich Hartmann, Leverkusen\nViele Wege führen nach Rom, aber nur zwei in die Champions League. Bevor es die Fußballer von Bayer Leverkusen im Europa-League-Halbfinale demnächst mit AS Rom zu tun bekommen im Kampf ums Finale und um ein goldenes Ticket für die Champions League, müssen sie in der Bundesliga erst noch alles dafür tun, den Kontakt zu den Top-Vier herzustellen. Und auch auf diesem Weg versuchen, sich einen Weg in die europäische Meisterklasse zu\xa0bahnen.\nZu diesem Zweck war der 2:0 (1:0)-Sieg am Sonntagabend gegen RB Leipzig ein weiterer Fortschritt. Seit zwei Monaten hat Bayer kein Spiel mehr verloren. Den Conference-League-Platz sechs hat man bereits erreicht. ""Es läuft zurzeit überragend bei uns"", freute sich hernach der Abwehrmann Jonathan Tah, ""und wir sammeln immer mehr Energie für die nächsten Spiele."" Am Samstag steht mit der Partie bei Union Berlin der nächste Test an. Die Champions-League-Aspiranten prüfen sich dieser Tage gegenseitig auf Herz, Nieren und taktische Schwächen. Am 11. Mai gastieren die Leverkusener dann zum Europa-League-Halbfinal-Hinspiel in\xa0Rom.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Interview von Javier Cáceres\nAuch für die Leipziger scheiden sich jetzt die Geister. Auch sie haben zwar noch einen Zweitwettbewerb in petto - sie spielen am 2. Mai ein DFB-Pokal-Halbfinale beim SC Freiburg -, allerdings geht es im Pokal nicht um eine Karte für die Champions League, nur für die Europa League. Das wäre den Leipzigern zu wenig. Umso bedeutsamer sind die nächsten Spiele in der Bundesliga. Am Samstag empfangen sie die TSG\xa0Hoffenheim.\nDie Leverkusener, mit zwölf Pflichtspielen ohne Niederlage als derzeit formstärkstes Team der Liga in dieses Duell gegangen, mussten auf ihren wichtigsten Mittelfeldspieler Florian Wirtz verzichten. Der 19-Jährige saß mit Magen-Darm-Verstimmung immerhin auf der Tribüne, sah von dort aber zunächst eine aktivere Leipziger Mannschaft. Deren Trainer Marco Rose hatte kurz vor dem Spiel bei Dazn verraten, dass man ""Chancen im Rücken von Jeremie Frimpong"" suchen werde. Frimpong ist Bayers supertorgefährlicher Rechtsaußenstürmerverteidiger, der vom niederländischen Nationaltrainer Ronald Koeman wegen Defensivschwächen aber ignoriert wird. Koeman sieht in ihm irgendwie gar keinen\xa0Abwehrmann.\nDie Leipziger fanden trotz weitgehender Überlegenheit keine Chancen im Rücken von Frimpong. Stattdessen platzierte Leverkusens Piero Hincapié nach 30 Minuten einen trockenen 30-Meter-Lattenschuss als Warnung, ehe Adam Hlozek in der 40. Minute die 1:0-Führung für die Gastgeber erzielte. Der Angriff war über rechts erfolgt, über die Seite von Frimpong und Moussa Diaby, der auch die Vorlage zum Treffer gab. Im Rücken von Frimpong jubelten die Leverkusener\xa0Abwehrspieler.\nBei Leipzig kam nach der Pause Christopher Nkunku für Kevin Kampl. Das sächsische Spiel benötigte im rheinischen Dauerregen mehr Vertikalität. Dies erschwerten ihnen die Leverkusener allerdings dadurch, dass sie sich sehr weit zurückzogen. So gingen die Leipziger Bälle horizontal von links nach rechts und zurück. Chancen ergaben sich trotzdem, etwa durch Standards, das Eckenverhältnis lautete am Ende 9:0 für Leipzig. Allein, ein Tor blieb ihnen\xa0versagt.\nAusgerechnet Frimpong, mit breiter Brust statt anfälligem Rücken, entschied die Partie fünf Minuten vor Schluss für Leverkusen. Seinen Konter beendete Leipzigs Dominik Szoboszlai im Strafraum per Foul, was ihm die gelb-rote Karte einbrachte und Bayer einen Elfmeter, den Nadiem Amiri in der 86. Minute zum 2:0 einschoss. ""Einige Statistiken gewonnen zu haben, bringt uns nichts"", klagte Leipzigs Benjamin Henrichs, ""wir waren in entscheidenden Szenen nicht konsequent\xa0genug.""\nDFB-Präsident Bernd Neuendorf und Rudi Völler, neuer Sportchef der Nationalelf, sprechen vor dem Sportausschuss des Bundestages über die WM in Katar.

"{'content': 'Bayer-Trainer Xabi Alonso versank in einer Jubeltraube vor der Leverkusener Bank.\nDie Werkself, beim Amtsantritt des Spaniers im Oktober noch Vorletzter, besiegte RB Leipzig am Sonntag etwas glücklich mit 2:0 (1:0) und rückte nach dem 13. Pflichtspiel ohne Niederlage als Sechster bis auf vier Zähler an die Sachsen heran. Drei Tage nach dem Halbfinal-Einzug in der Europa League nahm Bayer in der Fußball-Bundesliga Tuchfühlung zu den Champions-League-Plätzen auf.\n""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr, sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft"", sagte Bayers starker Innenverteidiger Jonathan Tah im Streamingdienst DAZN und lobte die Kollegen: ""Wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt."" Tah kündigte für den Saison-Endspurt an: ""Wir machen weiter, wir sind nicht zufrieden."" RB-Trainer Marco Rose ärgerte sich dagegen: ""Das war das x-te Spiel diese Saison, was wir einfach nicht verlieren dürfen.""\nDer bisherige Tabellen-Vierte Leipzig rutschte durch die schon achte Saison-Niederlage aus den Champions-League-Rängen und belegt nun direkt vor Bayer Platz fünf. Adam Hlozek (40. Minute) und Nadiem Amiri per Foulelfmeter (86.) erzielten Leverkusens Tore. Die Sachsen belohnten sich für ihre klare Überlegenheit in der zweiten Halbzeit nicht und verloren Dominik Szoboszlai vor dem Elfmeter durch eine Gelb-Rote Karte.\nLeipzig zielstrebig, aber ""nicht konsequent genug""\n""In den entscheidenden Momenten waren wir nicht konsequent genug, sowohl offensiv als auch defensiv"", sagte RB-Profi Benjamin Henrichs und sprach von einem Rückschlag. ""Das ist so ein Muster, was uns Punkte kostet. Wir sind nicht effektiv genug.""\nBei Bayer standen gleich drei der wichtigsten Leistungsträger der vergangenen Wochen gar nicht im Kader. Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz fehlte nach Vereinsangaben wegen Magen-Darm-Problemen und saß mit blau-weißer Basecap auf der Tribüne. Abwehrspieler Edmond Tapsoba wurde wegen muskulärer Probleme als Vorsichtsmaßnahme geschont, der argentinische Weltmeister Exquiel Palacios wurde nicht rechtzeitig fit.\nDie Leipziger, denen Nationalspieler David Raum wegen einer Gelbsperre fehlte, waren zunächst die frischere und aktivere Mannschaft. Timo Werner hatte in der sechsten Minute aus spitzem Winkel schon die Führung auf dem Fuß, schoss Bayer-Keeper Lukas Hradecky aber gegen den Brustkorb.\nDie Leverkusener, die in den vergangenen Wochen ihr Offensivspiel mehr aus einer kompakten Defensive aufzogen, standen diesmal noch tiefer. Doch dann bekamen sie plötzlich die Konterchance schlechthin, als Mitchel Bakker, Kerem Demirbay und Moussa Diaby nach einem Leipziger Eckball zu dritt gegen einen aufs Tor zuliefen und den Ball vertändelten (28.). Piero Hincapiés Fernschuss aus 30 Metern unterschätzte Torwart Janis Blaswich, sodass der Ball gegen die Latte klatschte (32.).\nLeverkusen lauert und entscheidet spät\nLeipzig hatte im ersten Durchgang über 60 Prozent Ballbesitz und nominell deutlich mehr Torschüsse. Doch die besseren Chancen hatte Leverkusen und die vierte nutzten die Rheinländer dann, als Hlozek eine scharfe Hereingabe von Diaby aus zehn Metern zu seinem fünften Saisontor einschob.\nLeipzigs Trainer Marco Rose brachte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku. Deutschlands Fußballer des Jahres hatte nach einem Außenbandriss in der Vorwoche ein 16-minütiges Comeback gegeben. Leipzigs Spiel wurde zwar nur etwas zielstrebiger, doch nun gab es wenigstens Chancen. Vor allem eben durch Nkunku, dem Tah nach einer Parade von Hradecky den Ball in letzter Sekunde vor den Füßen wegschlug (66.). Kurz darauf parierte Hradecky den Kopfball von Willi Orban nach einem Eckball (68.). Frimpong verpasste bei einem Leverkusener Konter noch die Entscheidung (83.), für die dann Amiri vom Elfmeterpunkt sorgte.

"{'content': 'In seiner Analyse der Niederlage bei Bayer Leverkusen und dem Sturz aus den Champions-League-Plätzen kam RB Leipzigs Marco Rose immer wieder zum selben Schluss. ""Am Ende läuft alles unter dem Übergriff Galligkeit, Gier und Zug zum Tor"", sagte Rose nach dem 0:2 (0:1) am Sonntagabend.\nBei den sichtlich müden Leverkusenern, die drei Tage zuvor in das Halbfinale der Europa League eingezogen waren, verbuchte RB 26 Torschüsse und 9:0 Ecken bei 63 Prozent Ballbesitz. Doch am Ende half das nichts, denn es kamen nicht einmal viele Großchancen dabei heraus. ""Das ist das x-te Spiel in dieser Saison, das wir einfach nicht hätten verlieren dürfen"", sagte der Coach: ""Das ist so ein bisschen die Geschichte unserer Saison.""\nUnd vielleicht dachte er sogar wehmütig an das Rennen um den Meistertitel zwischen seinem Ex-Club Borussia Dortmund und dem FC Bayern, als er sagte: ""Das ist sehr schade. Weil heute so viel mehr drin gewesen wäre. Und weil insgesamt in dieser Saison mehr drin gewesen wäre.""\nGanze neun Zähler liegt RB nach 29 Spielen hinter Spitzenreiter Dortmund, den die Sachsen kürzlich im Pokal hochverdient rauswarfen. Doch statt ganz oben mitzumischen, steht Leipzig plötzlich nicht einmal mehr auf einem Champions-League-Platz. Und hat zudem noch die seit 13 Pflichtspielen ungeschlagenen Leverkusener mit vier Punkten Abstand im Nacken.\nKapitän Willi Orban stellte jedenfalls klar, dass nun keine Ausreden mehr gelten. ""Wir reden immer viel, aber wir müssen die Spiele auch ziehen"", sagte der Abwehrchef: ""Das war ein kleiner Dämpfer. Aber es gibt noch 15 Punkte zu holen. Und wir wollen die 15 Punkte holen."" Angesichts von Auswärtsspielen beim derzeitigen Zweiten in München und Vierten in Freiburg ein ambitioniertes Ziel.\nUnd dafür muss die Niederlage erst einmal verarbeitet werden.

Gute Gründe für ein paar Überlegungen in diese Richtung hat er angesichts der Entwicklungen im Meisterkampf aber zweifellos gehabt, und dass der Trainer von RB Leipzig am Sonntag ziemlich viel über Fußball nachdachte, war nicht zu übersehen, während der 0:2-Niederlage bei Bayer Leverkusen.\nImmer wieder stand Rose in Denkerpose in seiner Coachingzone, kraulte seinen Bart und fand doch keine Lösung gegen das Team seines derzeit erfolgreichen Kollegen Xabi Alonso, der noch auf den Gewinn der Europa League hoffen kann. Mit einer ebenso schlauen wie pragmatischen Spielweise haben die Leverkusener durch Tore von Adam Hlozek und Nadiem Amiri Leipzig besiegt.\nGut 25 Minuten war praktisch nichts passiert in dieser Partie, die als eine Art Spitzenspiel um die Teilnahme an der kommenden Champions-League-Saison betrachtet werden konnte.\xa0Leverkusen\xa0wirkte matt. Und Leipzig ist in diesem Frühjahr einfach unzuverlässig, schwer berechenbar und ineffizient.\nDas Spiel floss in etlichen Phasen ruhig vor sich hin. Bis die etwas intensivere Schlussphase begann, passierte abgesehen von einzelnen Momenten nicht sehr viel. Früh im Spiel vergeudete die Werkself eine tolle Vier-gegen-Einen-Konterchance, weil Mitchell Bakker ins Abseits gelaufen war, und vor dem Leverkusener Tor kam Dominik Szoboszlai zu einem Torabschluss aus guter Position, schoss jedoch nicht platziert genug (30.). Unter der Abwesenheit von Florian Wirtz litt scheinbar nicht nur die Werkself, sondern das gesamte Spielniveau.\nDer Nationalspieler saß aufgrund eines Magen-Darm-Infektes auf der Tribüne, von wo er dann nach 40 Minuten die Führung für sein Team bejubeln konnte. Robert Andrich hatte einen exzellenten Pass in die Tiefe auf Moussa Diaby gespielt, der den Ball in den Rücken der Abwehr weiterleitete, von wo Hlozek aus elf Metern zum 1:0 traf. Das war eine verdiente Führung in einer Partie, in die Leipzig eine Stunde lang viel zu wenig investierte, angesichts der Ausgangslage.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nAlle Infos und Themen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF.A.Z.-Sonderseite zu Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlle Teams im Überblick\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie aktuelle Tabelle der Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlles in der Übersicht\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpielplan der Bundesliga: Termine, Ergebnisse, Partien\nAm Nachmittag hatte Freiburg die Sachsen in der Tabelle überholt, womit RB aus den Champions-League-Plätzen herausgerutscht war. Aber die Mannschaft fand auch nach der Pause lange keine guten Lösungen gegen diese von\xa0Alonso\xa0stabilisierte Leverkusener Mannschaft, die in der zweiten Hälfte einfach auf Konter lauerte.\nWieder passierte lange nichts, bis in der 66. Minute Leverkusens Torhüter Lukas Hradecky zunächst gegen Timo Werner rettete und anschließend einen gefährlichen Kopfball von Willi Orban hielt. Das war nicht gefährlich genug, und die Leverkusener Gegenangriffe stoppten die Leipziger immer wieder mit Fouls.

Pflichtspiel ohne Niederlage als Sechster bis auf vier Zähler an die Sachsen heran. Drei Tage nach dem Halbfinal-Einzug in der Europa League nahm Bayer in der Fußball-Bundesliga Tuchfühlung zu den Champions-League-Plätzen auf.\n""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr, sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft"", sagte Bayers starker Innenverteidiger Jonathan Tah im Streamingdienst DAZN und lobte die Kollegen: ""Wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt."" Tah kündigte für den Saison-Endspurt an: ""Wir machen weiter, wir sind nicht zufrieden."" RB-Trainer Marco Rose ärgerte sich dagegen: ""Das war das x-te Spiel diese Saison, was wir einfach nicht verlieren dürfen.""\nDer bisherige Tabellen-Vierte Leipzig rutschte durch die schon achte Saison-Niederlage aus den Champions-League-Rängen und belegt nun direkt vor Bayer Platz fünf. Adam Hlozek (40. Minute) und Nadiem Amiri per Foulelfmeter (86.) erzielten Leverkusens Tore.

""Das ist so ein Muster, was uns Punkte kostet. Wir sind nicht effektiv genug.""\nBei Bayer standen gleich drei der wichtigsten Leistungsträger der vergangenen Wochen gar nicht im Kader. Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz fehlte nach Vereinsangaben wegen Magen-Darm-Problemen und saß mit blau-weißer Basecap auf der Tribüne. Abwehrspieler Edmond Tapsoba wurde wegen muskulärer Probleme als Vorsichtsmaßnahme geschont, der argentinische Weltmeister Exquiel Palacios wurde nicht rechtzeitig fit.\nDie Leipziger, denen Nationalspieler David Raum wegen einer Gelbsperre fehlte, waren zunächst die frischere und aktivere Mannschaft. Timo Werner hatte in der sechsten Minute aus spitzem Winkel schon die Führung auf dem Fuß, schoss Bayer-Keeper Lukas Hradecky aber gegen den Brustkorb.\nDie Leverkusener, die in den vergangenen Wochen ihr Offensivspiel mehr aus einer kompakten Defensive aufzogen, standen diesmal noch tiefer. Doch dann bekamen sie plötzlich die Konterchance schlechthin, als Mitchel Bakker, Kerem Demirbay und Moussa Diaby nach einem Leipziger Eckball zu dritt gegen einen aufs Tor zuliefen und den Ball vertändelten (28.). Piero Hincapiés Fernschuss aus 30 Metern unterschätzte Torwart Janis Blaswich, sodass der Ball gegen die Latte klatschte (32.).\nLeverkusen lauert und entscheidet spät\nLeipzig hatte im ersten Durchgang über 60 Prozent Ballbesitz und nominell deutlich mehr Torschüsse. Doch die besseren Chancen hatte Leverkusen und die vierte nutzten die Rheinländer dann, als Hlozek eine scharfe Hereingabe von Diaby aus zehn Metern zu seinem fünften Saisontor einschob.\nLeipzigs Trainer Marco Rose brachte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku. Deutschlands Fußballer des Jahres hatte nach einem Außenbandriss in der Vorwoche ein 16-minütiges Comeback gegeben. Leipzigs Spiel wurde zwar nur etwas zielstrebiger, doch nun gab es wenigstens Chancen. Vor allem eben durch Nkunku, dem Tah nach einer Parade von Hradecky den Ball in letzter Sekunde vor den Füßen wegschlug (66.). Kurz darauf parierte Hradecky den Kopfball von Willi Orban nach einem Eckball (68.).

"{'content': 'Timo Werner und seine Leipziger kassierten in Leverkusen einen Rückschlag im Kampf um einen Platz in der Champions League.\n(Foto: IMAGO/Nordphoto)\nIm Europacup ist Bayer Leverkusen der einzige Bundesligist im Halbfinale. Und in der Liga rollt die Werkself weiter das Feld von hinten auf. Leipzig rutscht derweil aus den Champions-League-Rängen. Pechvogel bei den anrennenden Gästen ist DFB-Stürmer Timo Werner.\nHöhenflug in Europa, Aufholjagd in der Liga: Die Titeljäger von Bayer Leverkusen haben ihren beeindruckenden Lauf auch gegen RB Leipzig fortgesetzt. Drei Tage nach dem Sprung ins Europa-League-Halbfinale schlug die gnadenlos effektive Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso den DFB-Pokalsieger 2:0 (1:0) und nahm vorsichtig die Champions-League-Plätze ins Visier. ""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft. Wir haben wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt"", sagte Jonathan Tah bei DAZN: ""Wir machen immer weiter und sind nicht zufrieden.""\nAdam Hlozek (40.) und Nadiem Amiri (86., Foulelfmeter) erzielten vor 29.085 Zuschauern die Tore für die Leverkusener, die auch ohne Florian Wirtz im achten Ligaspiel in Folge ungeschlagen blieben. Die Leipziger, die im siebten Auswärtsspiel erstmals bei Bayer verloren und das Spiel nach einer Gelb-Roten Karte gegen Dominik Szoboszlai (85.) zu zehnt beendeten, sind nur noch vier Punkte entfernt und rutschten nach dem 29. Spieltag aus den Königsklassen-Plätzen. Bayer lauert unmittelbar dahinter als Sechster. ""Wir haben nicht schlecht gespielt, aber das bringt uns nichts - wir haben es nicht konsequent genug zu Ende gespielt"", sagte Leipzigs Benjamin Henrichs. Diese fehlende Konsequenz ""kostet uns Punkte"".\nNach dem Einzug ins erste Europapokal-Halbfinale seit 21 Jahren am Donnerstag wechselte Alonso dreimal - zweimal davon zwangsweise: Der formstarke Wirtz fehlte am späten Sonntagnachmittag wegen Magen-Darm-Beschwerden ebenso wie Edmond Tapsoba, der aufgrund von muskulären Problemen aussetzen musste.\nGegen Angstgegner Leipzig, der vor dem Duell nur zwei von 13 Pflichtspielen gegen die Rheinländer verloren hatte, agierten die Leverkusener anfangs deutlich passiver als noch unter der Woche bei Union Saint-Gilloise (4:1). Die Anfangsphase gehörte den Gästen: Timo Werner, Doppelpacker beim 3:2 gegen den FC Augsburg, testete Bayer-Torwart Lukas Hradecky erstmals (6.).\nLeverkusen streute immer wieder ungewohnte Fehlpässe und technische Fehler im Spielaufbau ein. Leipzig konnte die Ballgewinne aber zunächst nicht in gezielte Angriffe ummünzen. Das Spiel verflachte in der Folge: Bayer überließ RB meist den Ball und lauerte auf Konter - spielte die wenigen Umschaltaktionen aber anfangs zu ungenau aus. Aus dem Nichts sorgte Piero Hincapie (32.) mit einem Lattentreffer aus rund 30 Metern für die beste Bayer-Szene bis dahin, Leverkusen war nun aktiver und belohnte sich: Hlozek vollendete einen Konter nach einer scharfen Hereingabe von Moussa Diaby technisch stark mit links.\nDie Führung kam zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend und bescherte Bayer gleichwohl Sicherheit. Leipzig, mit drei Pflichtspielsiegen in Folge ins Rheinland gereist, schien beeindruckt. Wirtz verfolgte auf der Tribüne bei starkem Regen, wie Bayer die Führung mit zunehmender Spieldauer nur noch verwaltete. Rose hatte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku, der nach seinem Muskelfaserriss das zweite Spiel bestritt, für Kevin Kampl gebracht und damit offensiv gewechselt.\nNkunku (62.) leitete mit seinem Abschluss die beste Leipziger Phase ein. Die müde wirkenden Leverkusener beschränkten sich nur noch aufs Verteidigen und gingen damit ins Risiko. Werner (66.) vergab eine Riesenchance gegen Hradecky. RB rannte weiter an - war dabei aber anfällig für Konter. Die Sachsen belohnten sich für ihre klare Überlegenheit. Szoboszlai brachte bei einem solchen Leverkusener Angriff Jeremie Frimpong zu Fall und musste vom Feld. Amiri verwandelte vom Elfmeterpunkt.\nQuelle: ntv.de, tno/sid'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Manche Fans wähnen sie auf dem Weg zur ""besten SBC aller Zeiten"".\nAuf dem realen wie virtuellen Rasen zurzeit bärenstark: Moussa Diaby.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Crystal Pix/EA SPORTS\nKeine 70 Sekunden benötigte Moussa Diaby am Donnerstagabend, um Bayer Leverkusen im Rückspiel des Europa-League-Viertelfinals gegen Union Saint-Gilloise auf die Siegerstraße zu hieven. Sein frühes 1:0 ebnete den Weg zum 4:1-Auswärtserfolg und zum Einzug ins Halbfinale. Glücklich machte Diaby damit nicht nur die Fans der Werkself, sondern auch viele Spieler von FIFA 23 Ultimate Team (FUT).\nWer zwischen dem 17. und 24. Februar die SBC zu seiner Spezialkarte im Rahmen der Road-to-the-Final-Promo (RTTF) abgeschlossen hat, erntet mittlerweile die Früchte. Zwei Upgrades hat das dynamische Objekt bereits erhalten, der Halbfinaleinzug wird ein drittes bescheren. Dieses bedeutet eine Steigerung des Overall-Ratings von 90 auf 91 Punkte, zudem erhält RTTF-Diaby drei neue Eigenschaften.\nDas Tempo des Franzosen ist aktuell schon mit maximalen 99 Punkten bewertet, das Dribbling (93) dürfte auf 94 Zähler steigen. Auch der Schuss (84) und der Pass (84) werden mindestens einen Punkt hinzugewinnen - die Spezialkarte wird immer stärker. Zum einem absoluten Top-Objekt in FUT 23 würde sie avancieren, sollte Bayer gegen die AS Rom den Sprung ins Finale der Europa League schaffen.\nDas Upgrade zum Einzug ins Endspiel würde den schwachen Fuß auf fünf Sterne verbessern. Im Falle eines Europa-League-Triumphs könnte sich RTTF-Diaby auf einen weiteren zusätzlichen Punkt für die Gesamtbewertung und auf fünf Sterne für die Spezialbewegungen freuen. Maximales Tempo, Dribbling im hohen 90er-Bereich, jeweils fünf Sterne für Weak Foot und Skills - ein Monster für die rechte Seite.\nWenig überraschend wächst der Hype in den sozialen Medien mit jeder überstandenen Europa-League-Runde. ""Können wir uns alle darauf einigen, dass das die beste SBC aller Zeiten wäre?"", fragt etwa \'FUT Rory\' seine fast 160.000 Follower auf Twitter. Dabei bezieht sich der Content Creator lediglich auf die nächste Upgrade-Stufe. Bei einem Leverkusener Titelgewinn stünde es für ihn ""nicht mal zur Debatte"".\n\'FUTSacha\', der auf TikTok eine große Anhängerschaft hinter sich schart, spricht ebenfalls von der ""SBC mit dem besten Wert aller Zeiten"". Die günstigste Lösung der Teambau-Herausforderung für RTTF-Diaby kostete laut \'FutBin\' in besagter Februar-Woche gerade mal 92.000 Münzen im Peak. Schon damals wurde die SBC als Schnäppchen gehandelt, in der Retrospektive könnte sie zum FUT-Coup des Jahres werden.\nZahlreiche Spieler, die Diabys SBC verpasst oder bewusst ausgelassen haben, ärgern sich derzeit öffentlich. Eine noch bitterere Pille hat der Influencer \'ZwebackHD\' zu schlucken: ""Das größte Bedauern meines Lebens ist, ihn für Flashback-Mané eingetauscht zu haben."" Unter diesem Satz prangt eine Voraussage zur Karte inklusive neuem Upgrade, das in den kommenden Tagen von EA SPORTS implementiert werden sollte.\nNicht nur Bayer-Fans werden ihrer Mannschaft in der Vorschlussrunde gegen die Roma die Daumen drücken, auch Besitzer der dynamischen Spezialkarte dürften mitfiebern. Ein Finaleinzug ist angesichts der jüngsten Leistungskurve der Werkself trotz des namhaften Gegners sicherlich nicht unrealistisch: Wettbewerbsübergreifend ist Leverkusen seit inzwischen zwölf Partien ungeschlagen.\nNiklas Aßfalg\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Moussa Diaby,de

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nXabi Alonso macht Leverkusen besser - und lernt zugleich als Trainernovize viel dazu.\nLeverkusen erreicht erstmals seit 21 Jahren ein Europapokal-Halbfinale. Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso - auch, weil er erfolgreich gegen Leverkusener Sitten ansteuert.\nVon Philipp Selldorf, Leverkusen\nNach dem Coup im Lotto-Stadion in Anderlecht wurde im inneren Zirkel Bayer Leverkusens vor allem über die angemessene Zuteilung von Siegerbieren diskutiert. Der Torwart Lukas Hradecky nahm seine Kapitänspflichten gewissenhaft wahr und eröffnete die Debatte. Üblicherweise informiert er nach gewonnenen Spielen in eigener Sache, er werde sich abends ""ein, zwei Bierchen"" gönnen, diesmal aber ging er als Teamsprecher im Stil eines Lokomotivführer-Gewerkschafters in die Tarifverhandlungen: ""Ich glaube, fünf Bier sind erlaubt"", sagte er mit Blick auf die dreistündige Busreise ins Rheinland. Simon Rolfes, der Vertreter der Arbeitgeberseite, deutete Entgegenkommen an (""das eine oder andere geht schon""), wies aber auch auf gebotene Grenzen hin: ""Das Fußballer-Leben ist\xa0hart.""\nRB Leipzig, am Sonntag der nächste Bundesliga-Gegner, darf sich womöglich freuen: Euphorisierte Leverkusener Profifußballer sind traditionell gern bereit, beim nächsten Pflichttermin etwas weniger diensteifrig aufzutreten. Bei dieser Mannschaft und diesem Trainer weiß man allerdings nicht, ob überlieferte Sitten noch gelten. Zwar erzählt man sich am Rhein, Disziplin sei nicht die hervorragende Eigenschaft des aktuellen Bayer-Kaders, zugleich versichern die Bayer-Verantwortlichen jedoch, Trainer Xabi Alonso sei ein Mann, dem Disziplin und hausinterne Regeltreue viel bedeuteten. Es sieht so aus, als ob er sich damit durchsetzen\xa0würde.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Interview von Javier Cáceres\nBeim Europacup-Rückspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise obsiegte eindeutig die Linie des spanischen Trainers. Leverkusens 4:1-Sieg drückte nicht nur eine konzentrierte Leistung aus, er sah auch nach dem Triumph einer Mannschaft aus, die mit einer klaren Strategie ins Spiel gegangen war. Als Alonso nach dem 1:1 gegen eine abgezockte Union-Elf im Hinspiel vor einer Woche in aller Gelassenheit betonte, Bayer sei ""bereit"" und ""gut vorbereitet"" für die zweite Folge, klang das verdächtig vielsagend. Nun führte die Mannschaft vor, dass der Trainer für die beiden Viertelfinal-Spiele einen kombinierten Plan entworfen\xa0hatte.\nDass sein Team schon nach 67 Sekunden unter glücklichen Umständen in Führung gehen würde - Torschütze Moussa Diaby erhielt die Vorlage von Gegnerseite -, konnte zwar selbst der Fußballweise Alonso nicht voraussehen. Doch schon in der ersten Minute wurde die Leverkusener Spielanlage sichtbar, die von offensiven Rollenwechseln und einem stabilen defensiven Fundament geprägt war. Diaby, Florian Wirtz, Adam Hlozek und Jeremie Frimpong teilten sich die Räume nach Bedarf und Belieben. Auf der linken Seite marschierte derweil Mitchel Bakker auf und nieder, dass Hradecky an ein anatomisches Wunder glaubte: ""Ich weiß nicht, wie viele Lungen der Mann hat, wahrscheinlich mehr als\xa0zwei.""\nDem niederländischen Linksverteidiger Bakker, 22, wird nachgesagt, er verstehe es, innerhalb von zwei Szenen eines Fußballspiels sowohl Welt- als auch Kreisklasse zu verkörpern. Ferner ist er berüchtigt für häufiges Zuspätkommen, was ihn außer einigen Euro auch Einsätze bei Punktspielen gekostet hat. Zuletzt ist aber eine gewisse Regelmäßigkeit in seinen Arbeitszeiten eingekehrt, was auch für Bakkers Auftreten im Spiel gilt. Wild ist es hin und wieder immer noch, aber nicht mehr wüst wie früher. Beim Treffer zum 2:0 (37.) blieb Bakker cool und vollendete damit einen meisterlich ausgespielten Gegenangriff über Wirtz, Diaby und Flankengeber Hlozek. Am 3:0 (60.) hatte er seinen Anteil, als er dem zögerlichen Union-Torwart Anthony Moris so sehr zusetzte, dass dieser den Ball für Frimpong geradewegs zum Einschuss\xa0bereitlegte.\n21 Jahre sind vergangen, seit Bayer 04 das letzte Mal im Halbfinale eines Eurocups gestanden hat, es war die Saison, in der sich das Team um Ballack, Lucio, Bastürk und Berbatov als dreimaliger Vize unselig verewigte: in der Meisterschaft, im Pokal und in der Champions League. Kurioserweise hieß es vor dieser Saison, der aktuelle Bayer-Kader sei dank hochkarätiger Besetzung am ehesten geeignet, mit dem Ensemble von damals zu konkurrieren. Unselig geriet aber auch dessen Mission zunächst, und die ersten Amtshandlungen des im Herbst anstelle von Gerardo Seoane eingesetzten Trainers Alonso wollten ebenfalls nicht gleich\xa0glücken.\nInzwischen jedoch hat er Spieler wie Bakker neu erfunden, andere Spieler wiederentdeckt, die schon unauffindbar im Kader verloren gegangen waren (Exequiel Palacios, Nadiem Amiri), und wieder andere Spieler auf selten erreichtes Niveau getrimmt (Verteidiger Jonathan Tah). Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso. Leverkusens ""semifinalwürdige Leistung"" (Hradecky) in Brüssel wird weiter dazu\xa0beitragen.\nGerüchte darüber, dass ihn Real Madrids Patron Florentino Pérez als Nachfolger für Carlo Ancelotti herbeiwünscht - womöglich schon im Sommer -, sind auch den Bayer-Oberen bekannt und werden von ihnen nicht für unglaubwürdig gehalten. Sie verweisen jedoch gelassen auf seine Vertragsdauer (bis 2024) und auf Alonsos Klugheit. Als Trainer-Neuling hat er in Leverkusen schon viel gelernt, aber er wird noch viel mehr dazulernen können. Das Treffen mit der AS Rom im Halbfinale bietet dazu die beste Gelegenheit, dann bekommt er es mit dem alten Meistermacher José Mourinho zu\xa0tun.\nDer spektakuläre Trainerwechsel hat bei den Bayern die Saison nicht gerettet und bereits jetzt Thomas Tuchel beschädigt.

Seitdem Xabi Alonso Bayer 04 Anfang Oktober auf dem 17. Tabellenplatz übernommen hat, hat der Spanier die Mannschaft in einem schmerzhaften und nicht an Rückschlägen armen Umerziehungsprozess von einem wilden Haufen hochbegabter, aber genauso taktisch undisziplinierter Künstler zu einem Kollektiv geformt, das immer mehr die Konturen einer echten Spitzenmannschaft annimmt.\n""Es sind nur sechs, sieben Monate, aber es ist viel passiert. Am Anfang war es nicht einfach, aber es ist immer eine Entwicklung. Wir sind zufrieden, dass wir diese Stimmung verändern konnten und jetzt in dieser Position sind in der Bundesliga und in Europa"", resümierte Leverkusens Trainer später in den Katakomben der altehrwürdigen Arena.\nWobei er den größten Fortschritt der Kicker des Tabellensechsten zwischen den Ohren bewirkt hat. ""Wir haben geholfen, aber am meisten liegt es an den Spielern. Der Kopf muss stimmen. Ich habe immer gesagt, wir haben die Qualität, aber der Kopf ist wichtiger. Im Moment haben wir ein gutes Zusammenspiel zwischen Qualität und der Mentalität.  Dadurch haben wir es bis hierher geschafft"", erklärte der Spanier, um direkt deutlich zu machen, dass Anderlecht nur eine Zwischenstation gewesen sein soll, mit den Worten ""Und wir wollen mehr!"".\nNicht nur für einen Titelsammler wie Xabi Alonso kann dies einzig bedeuten, die Europa League zu gewinnen. ""Jetzt haben wir noch eine Reise. Wir werden sehen, wohin sie geht"", philosophierte der 41-Jährige und meinte damit sicher nicht nur den nächsten Gegner, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch in Rom in der Verlängerung zwischen der AS und Feyenoord Rotterdam\xa0(4:1 für Rom n.V.) ermittelt wurde. Der insgesamt erwachsene Auftritt in Belgien, bei dem Bayer einzig in der Viertelstunde nach dem 1:3 der Gastgeber ins Wanken geriet, deklariert den Bundesligisten als Titelanwärter.\nDer Wandel der Werkself unter Xabi Alonso ist mittlerweile unverkennbar. Und der Reifegrad dieser Mannschaft wurde in den 90 Minuten in Anderlecht gerade darin offenkundig, dass es eine Leistung der Leverkusener war, die über Jahre als völlig untypisch eingeordnet worden wäre. So präsentierte sich das Team in der Defensive mit einem überragenden Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah über eine Stunde lang so stabil, dass die keineswegs enttäuschenden Belgier bis dahin zu keiner ernsthaften Chance kamen. Erst als Xabi Alonso den starken Edmond Tapsoba aufgrund muskulärer Probleme in der Dreierkette durch Odilon Kossounou ersetzen musste, geriet der Bundesligist zwischenzeitlich in Bedrängnis.\nUmgekehrt zeigte sich Bayer, über Jahre der Inbegriff für Chancenwucher, bis auf die Endphase in der Offensive brutal effizient. Wobei man bei aller Euphorie im Leverkusener Lager anmerken muss, dass Saint-Gilles mit groben Aussetzern beim ersten und dritten Treffer der Werkself extrem in die Karten spielte.\nDass sich mit Mitchel Bakker zur Krönung des Unerwarteten ein Problemprofi zum herausragenden Akteur dieser Partie aufschwang, war die Pointe dieser phantastischen Reise, die Bayer unter Xabi Alonso im Zeitraffer absolviert hat. Der niederländische linke Schienenspieler, der in dieser Saison lang nur durch sportliche wie disziplinarische Aussetzer aufgefallen war, erzielte nicht nur das 2:0, provozierte nicht nur durch sein energisches Nachsetzen gegen Union-Keeper Anthony Moris dessen Fehlpass auf Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong vor dem 3:0 und setzte nicht nur mit einem feinen Zuspiel Moussa Diaby mit dem vorletzten Pass beim 4:1 durch Adam Hlozek in Szene, sondern präsentierte sich auch spielerisch ansprechend, defensiv solide sowie extrem einsatzfreudig.\nNicht umsonst stellte Kapitän Lukas Hradecky auf das ganze Team und speziell auf Bakker, der vor wenigen Wochen noch aus dem Spieltagsaufgebot gegen Hertha BSC gestrichen worden war, weil er das Abschusstraining verpennt hatte, fest: ""Alle kleinen Dinge kommen zusammen. Er hat richtig reagiert auf seine Suspendierung. Heute hatte er drei oder vier Lungen. Wie viel er läuft und was er momentan für die Mannschaft tut, ist großartig. Heute war das nicht Europa-League-Niveau, sondern Champions-League-Niveau von ihm.""\nKomplettiert wurde die These, dass Bayer eine Spitzenmannschaft wird, von der Bedeutung von Florian Wirtz in dieser Partie. Lautete die Gleichung bislang: Nur wenn Wirtz stark ist, ist auch Bayer stark, so wurde auch dieses scheinbare Naturgesetz am Donnerstag außer Kraft gesetzt. So war Leverkusens Genie mal eben nicht die spielentscheidende Figur, erlaubte sich bei aller spielerischer Klasse auf engstem Raum und wichtigen Pässen, um dem belgischen Pressing zu entgehen, auch ungewohnte Ballverluste, wie den vor dem 1:3. Dass der Werksklub trotzdem so überzeugend auftrat, ist das letzte, aber vielleicht auch klarste Indiz dafür, dass Xabi Alonsos Arbeit zu etwas Großem führen kann.\nDer Trainer jedenfalls möchte in dem bisher Geleisteten trotz eines positiven Zwischenfazits nur einen Anfang sehen. ""Ich habe vom ersten Tag an gesagt, wenn wir fragil sind, wenn wir nicht wie eine Mannschaft zusammen verteidigen, dann ist das nicht möglich. Jetzt verteidigen wir gut, spielen kompakt und haben immer die Qualität, Chancen zu erspielen. Jetzt haben wir diese Entwicklung"", konstatierte Xabi Alonso, ""aber es ist zu früh, eine Saisonanalyse zu machen. Wir haben noch fünf, sechs Wochen, danach kann man noch besser analysieren."" Und noch viel mehr erreicht haben.\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Es war die beste Leistung der Werkself in dieser Saison.\nDie BILD-Einzelkritik zum Viertelfinal-Rückspiel.\nLukas Hradecky: In der ersten Hälfte nicht geprüft. Machtlos beim Gegentor seines finnischen Landsmannes Kasper Terho. Sensationeller Reflex in der 75. Minute mitten in der Drangphase der Belgier. Note 2.\nEdmond Tapsoba: Der Burkiner stand sehr sicher und schaltete sich immer wieder gut mit ins Aufbauspiel ein. Wegen leichter muskulärer Beschwerden musste er früh raus. Note 2.\nJonathan Tah: So stark, so sicher, so gut – seine körperliche Präsenz war – wie im Hinspiel – beeindruckend. Sein Traumpass auf Azmoun kurz vor Schluss wäre die Krönung auf eine erneut sensationelle Vorstellung des Abwehrchefs gewesen. Tah ist in dieser Verfassung ganz klar wieder ein DFB-Kandidat. Note 1.\nPiero Hincapie: Hielt seine linke Seite weitestgehend dicht. Der Ecuadorianer kassierte kurz vor der Pause einen üblen Tritt von Lazare Amani auf die Wade, der mit der Roten Karte hätte bestraft werden müssen. Note 2.\n\nVortänzer: Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong und seine Kollegen feiern den Halbfinal-Einzug\nJeremie Frimpong: Ob vorne oder hinten – Frimpong war überall gleichzeitig, reagierte cool und nutzte seine Chance zum 3:0. Note 2.\nRobert Andrich: Wieder ein starker Auftritt des „emotionalen Leaders“ der Werkself, der längst eine Nominierung in der Nationalelf verdient hätte. Bei ihm merkte man in jeder Sekunde an, wie viel Lust er auf diese Nacht hatte. Note 2.\nNadiem Amiri: Dass er anstelle des angeschlagenen Exequiel Palacios beginnen würde, überraschte viele – wohl auch die Belgier. In der Offensive wenig Akzente, dafür enormer Einsatz für die Mannschaft. Note 3.\nMitchel Bakker: Ein Monster-Spiel des Niederländers. Volley-Abnahme zum 2:0, dann setzte er Union-Keeper Moris derart unter Druck, dass dieser Frimpong den Ball zum 3:0 „auflegte“. Auch das 4:1 leitete Bakker ein. Mehr geht nicht – bester Auftritt im Bayer-Trikot. Weltklasse. Note 1.\nMoussa Diaby: Der Franzose schoss das schnellste Europa-League-Tor der Saison. Auch an der Entstehung des zweiten und vierten Treffers entscheidend beteiligt. Note 2.\n\nFlorian Wirtz springt Mitchel Bakker auf den Rücken vor Freude\nAdam Hlozek: Stand überraschend in der Startelf und zahlte dieses Vertrauen eindrucksvoll zurück mit einer Super-Flanke auf Bakker zum 2:0 und seinem Abstauber zum 4:1, der das Spiel endgültig entschied. Note 2.\nFlorian Wirtz: Sorgte direkt für Unruhe in Unions Abwehr, was zum 1:0 durch Diaby führte. Sein Pass auf Diaby leitete den Traumkonter zum 2:0 ein. Aber: Sein Ballverlust führte auch zum Anschlusstreffer der Belgier. Die entscheidenden Szenen hatten diesmal andere, wobei sein kämpferischer Einsatz herausragend war. Note 3.\nKerem Demirbay (ab 59./für Amiri): Wie in den letzten Wochen mit einer guten Leistung. Er sorgte nach seiner Hereinnahme vor allem dafür, dass Bayer in der Druckphase der Belgier wieder die Kontrolle fand. Note 2.\n\nStolz auf seine Sieger: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nOdilon Kossounou (ab 59./für Tapsoba): Der Ivorer musste für den angeschlagenen Tapsoba die rechte Abwehrseite übernehmen, hatte in der Drangphase der Belgier auch einige Probleme, arbeitete sich aber von Minute zu Minute besser ins Spiel. Note 3.\nAmine Adli (ab 71./für Frimpong): Am Ende reichte es beim Franzosen zumindest für einen Joker-Einsatz, hatte kurz vor Schluss eine gute Schusschance. Note 3.\nSardar Azmoun (ab 86./für Hlozek): Der Iraner hatte in der Nachspielzeit zwei gute Möglichkeiten, vergab jedoch beide. Ohne Note.\nKarim Bellarabi (ab 86./für Diaby): Auch der Fan-Liebling bekam seine Chance, scheitert aber frei vor Torwart Moris. Ohne Note.\nXabi Alonso: Seine Mannschaft gewann über eine starke Defensive und effektive Offensive das Spiel deutlich. Kluge Wechsel in den richtigen Momenten brachten die Belgier in ihrer Drangphase aus dem Konzept. Sein Team ist seit zwölf Pflichtspielen unbesiegt, Alonsos Anteil an dieser Stabilität ist enorm.

"{'content': 'Der Traum vom Europa-League-Titel für Manchester United ist geplatzt. Die „Red Devils"" mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer mussten sich klar gegen den FC Sevilla geschlagen geben. Bayer Leverkusen zieht ins Halbfinale ein.\nFür Marcel Sabitzer und Manchester United ist der Traum vom Europa-League-Titel beim sechsfachen Rekordgewinner FC Sevilla geplatzt. Die späten Gegentore vom 2:2 im Heimhinspiel rächten sich am Donnerstag ebenso wie zwei peinliche Schnitzer, die Engländer unterlagen mit 0:3 (0:1) und müssen die anvisierte Champions-League-Qualifikation nun über die Premier League schaffen. Sevillas Halbfinalgegner am 11. und 18. Mai ist Juventus Turin, das die Hürde Sporting Lissabon nahm.\nMit Gernot Trauner (bis 106.) und Feyenoord Rotterdam musste sich ein weiterer ÖFB-Teamspieler verabschieden. In der Verlängerung gingen die Niederländer bei Salzburgs Zwischenrunden-Bezwinger AS Roma mit 1:4 (1:2,0:0) in die Knie. Die von Jose Mourinho trainierten Römer bekommen es nun mit Bayer Leverkusen zu tun, das nach einem 4:1 (2:0) über Union Saint-Gilloise Deutschlands letzte Hoffnung auf einen Europacuptitel ist.\nIn Sevilla bekam Sabitzer, nach einer leichten Blessur vor dem jüngsten Premier-League-Spiel rechtzeitig wieder fit geworden, die Motivation der Gastgeber gleich zu Beginn zu spüren. Kaum hatte man den Steirer nach einem Check an der Seitenlinie von Sevillas Ersatzbank ""geschält"", kam es aber wesentlich schlimmer für die Engländer. Harry Maguire, Eigentorschütze im Hinspiel, eröffnete dem aktuellen Tabellen-13. von La Liga mit einem kapitalen Rückpassfehler die Chance aufs 1:0, Youssef En-Nesyri nützte das trocken aus (8.).\nIm Gegensatz zum letztwöchigen Duell, als United nach schnellen Sabitzer-Toren es verabsäumte, einen klareren Erfolg gegen die lange handzahmen Spanier herauszuschießen, war Sevilla diesmal das tonangebende Team. Kurz vor der Pause zählte der nächste Treffer von Lucas Ocampos (42.) wegen Abseits\' aber nicht, quasi mit Wiederbeginn holte Sevilla das nach. Per Kopf und Unterlatte traf Loic Bade nach Corner zum 2:0 und damit zur Vorentscheidung. United legte in der Folge zwar zu, blieb aber ohne klare Chancen. Sabitzer machte in der 68. Minute Platz für Fred, im Finish schlug En-Nesyri nach schwerem Patzer von United-Goalie David DeGea ein weiteres Mal zu (81.).\nJuventus ging bei Sporting Lissabon, beflügelt von der Suspendierung der 15-Punkte-Abzugs in der Serie A Stunden davor, dank Adrien Rabiot (9.) in Führung, musste nach dem 1:0-Sieg im Hinspiel aber hart arbeiten. Denn die Portugiesen fanden durch den Foulelfer von Marcus Edwards (20.) die richtige Antwort und hatten durchaus noch Möglichkeiten auf den Führungstreffer zum 2:1, der sie zumindest in die Verlängerung gebracht hätte.\nDie AS Roma brauchte im Olympiastadion gegen Feyenoord genau eine Stunde, ehe Leonardo Spinazzola mit dem 1:0 das Hinspielergebnis egalisierte. Die Gäste wähnten sich im Finish dank ""Joker"" Igor Paixao (80.) bereits im Halbfinale, ehe Roma-Star Paulo Dybala (89.) mit dem 2:1 die Verlängerung erzwang. Dort wurden Stephan El Shaarawy (101.) und Lorenzo Pellegrini (108.) zu den Matchwinnern. Die Roma kann im Jahr nach dem Triumph in der Conference League nun auch vom Titel in der zweithöchsten Kategorie träumen.\nLeverkusen führte in Brüssel dank Traumstart durch Moussa Diaby (2.) und später Mitchel Bakker (37.) sowie Jeremie Frimpong (60.) mit 3:0 und ließ sich den Aufstieg nicht mehr nehmen. Zudem traf Adam Hlozek (79.) für die Deutschen, Casper Terho (65.) erzielte das Ehrentor für die Gastgeber.\nIn der Conference League kam AC Fiorentina zuhause dank zweier später Tore von Riccardo Sottil (78.) und Gaetano Castrovilli (92.) gegen Lech Posen von 0:3 noch auf 2:3 zurück und erreichte so mit dem Gesamtscore von 6:4 das Halbfinale, in dem der FC Basel wartet. OGC Nizza lag gegen die Schweizer durch Gaetan Laborde (9.) auf Aufstiegskurs, ließ sich im Finish das Glück aber noch entreißen. Jean-Kevin Augustin (86.) und Kasim Adams in der Verlängerung (98.) belohnten die Leistungssteigerung der Schweizer spät aber doch. Das Team von Ex-Sturm-Graz-Coach Heiko Vogel kam mit 2:1 und gesamt 4:3 weiter.\nAZ Alkmaar machte mit dem 2:0 nach 90 bzw. 120 Minuten gegen RSC Anderlecht das 0:2 aus dem Hinspiel wett und setzte sich im Elferschießen mit 4:1 durch. Die Niederländer treffen auf West Ham United, das nach 0:1-Rückstand gegen KAA Gent innerhalb von neun Minuten durch Lucas Paqueta (55.), Declan Rice (58.) und Michail Antonio (63.) die perfekte Wende schaffte und schließlich 4:1 bzw. gesamt 5:2 siegte.\n(APA)\nZum „Das Wichtigste des Tages“ Newsletter anmelden\nDer einzigartige Journalismus der Presse.

Der aus dem Hinspiel angeschlagene argentinische Weltmeister Exequiel Palacios verlor den Wettlauf gegen die Zeit und stand nicht im Kader, auch Stürmer Amine Adli nahm zunächst auf der Bank\xa0Platz.\nDer spektakuläre Trainerwechsel hat bei den Bayern die Saison nicht gerettet und bereits jetzt Thomas Tuchel beschädigt. Dennoch fehlt die Fantasie, dass jemand dafür Verantwortung übernehmen muss - wenn doch, würde es spannend. \n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Kommentar von Philipp Schneider\nGegen die Werkself musste Saint-Gilloise wie zuvor im Achtelfinale gegen Union Berlin in den Lotto Park von Lokalrivale RSC Anderlecht ausweichen, weil das eigene Stadion nicht den Uefa-Richtlinien entspricht und schlicht zu klein ist. Aufgrund einer Wohnblock-Evakuierung wegen eines Gaslecks kam es vorher zu einem Verkehrschaos, pünktlich zum Anpfiff war das Stadion aber\xa0voll.\nDer belgische Klub hatte am Wochenende in der Liga gleich sieben Stammkräfte geschont, den frischeren Eindruck machten aber von Beginn an die Gäste. Die rund 1700 mitgereisten Bayer-Fans, die sich beim Einlaufen mit roten Plastik-Ponchos im Gästeblock zu erkennen gaben, sahen einen Traumstart: Diaby wurde vom Hinspiel-Torschützen Florian Wirtz auf die Reise geschickt, umkurvte Union-Keeper Anthony Moris und schob zur Führung\xa0ein.\nBemerkenswert biegsam: Moussa Diaby sorgt nach nicht einmal 70 Sekunden für Leverkusens Führung.\nBayer agierte konzentriert, bissig in den Zweikämpfen und immer wieder gefährlich im Umschaltspiel. Diaby scheiterte am Außennetz (16.), Adli-Vertreter Hlozek verpasste eine stramme Hereingabe von Bakker nur knapp (22.). Der Flankengeber machte es wenig später dann selbst: Erneut eroberte Wirtz im Mittelfeld den Ball, diesmal agierte Diaby als Ballverteiler, die traumhafte Flanke von Hlozek musste Bakker aus fünf Metern nur noch über die Linie\xa0drücken.\nDie zuvor harmlosen Gastgeber kamen schwungvoller aus der Kabine. Mitten in der besten Phase von Saint-Gilloise nutzte Frimpong einen schweren Torwart-Patzer von Moris zum 3:0. Aber die Belgier gaben sich nicht auf, durften nach dem Treffer von Terho noch einmal hoffen und hatten durch Toptorjäger Victor Boniface (66.), Simon Adingra (69.) und Senne Lynen (75.) exzellente Gelegenheiten zum Anschluss - doch Hlozek beseitigte die letzten Zweifel am Triumph des\xa0Bundesliga-Sechsten.\nGegen den vermeintlichen Außenseiter Union Saint-Gilloise muss ein Präzisionsschuss des Teenagers ein prekäres Remis retten. Erst in der Schlussphase sieht die Bayer-Elf wie der Favorit für den Einzug ins Halbfinale aus.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

"{'content': 'Die europäische Reise ist für Manchester United in dieser Saison zu Ende gegangen. Die „Red Devils“ verloren am Donnerstag mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer in der Startelf das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der UEFA Europa League beim FC Sevilla mit 0:3 (0:1). Nach dem 2:2 im Hinspiel machten sich die englischen Gäste mit Eigenfehlern wieder das Leben schwer. Gernot Trauner musste sich mit Feyenoord Rotterdam der AS Roma mit 1:4 n. V. beugen.\nIn Sevilla brachte der spanische ManUnited-Tormann David de Gea Harry Maguire in Bedrängnis, der Abwehrchef verlor unter Druck dreier Sevilla-Spieler den Ball, und am Ende vollendete Youssef En-Nesyri zur frühen Führung (8). Kurz nach der Pause erhöhte Loic Bade (47.), und En-Neysri traf nach einem Patzer von de Gea zum 3:0 (81.).\nSabitzer, der bis kurz vor Spielbeginn wegen einer Blessur fraglich war, wurde früh in der Partie ins Seitenaus gecheckt und musste behandelt werden. Trainer Erik ten Hag nahm ihn in der 68. vom Feld. Sevilla trifft nun im Halbfinale auf Juventus Turin, das nach einem 1:1 bei Sporting Lissabon (Hinspiel 1:0) in der Vorschlussrunde steht. Bayer Leverkusen (4:1 bei Union St. Gilloise, Hinspiel 1:1) musste länger warten, ehe der Gegner feststand: Die AS Roma setzte sich daheim gegen Feyenoord letztlich mit 4:1 nach Verlängerung (Hinspiel: 0:1) durch.\nManchester United ist aus dem Europacup ausgeschieden. Die „Red Devils“ verloren mit dem wieder genesenen Marcel Sabitzer in der Startelf das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der Europa League beim FC Sevilla mit 0:3 (0:1).\nIn Sevilla bekam Sabitzer, nach einer leichten Blessur vor dem jüngsten Premier-League-Spiel rechtzeitig wieder fit geworden, die Motivation der Gastgeber gleich zu Beginn zu spüren. Wenig später kam es noch wesentlich schlimmer für die Engländer. De Gea und Maguire, Eigentorschütze im Hinspiel, eröffneten dem aktuellen Tabellen-13. von La Liga die Chance aufs 1:0, Youssef En-Nesyri nützte das aus (8.).\nIm Gegensatz zum letztwöchigen Duell, als es United nach schnellen Sabitzer-Toren verabsäumte, einen klareren Erfolg gegen die lange handzahmen Spanier herauszuschießen, war Sevilla diesmal das tonangebende Team. Kurz vor der Pause zählte der nächste Treffer von Lucas Ocampos (42.) wegen Abseits aber nicht, quasi mit Wiederbeginn holte Sevilla das nach. Per Kopf und Unterlatte traf Loic Bade nach Corner zum 2:0 und damit zur Vorentscheidung. United legte in der Folge zwar zu, blieb aber ohne klare Chancen. Sabitzer machte in der 68. Minute Platz für Fred, im Finish schlug En-Nesyri nach schwerem Patzer von de Gea ein weiteres Mal zu (81.).\nDie AS Roma brauchte im Olympiastadion gegen Feyenoord eine Stunde, ehe Leonardo Spinazzola mit dem 1:0 das Hinspielergebnis egalisierte. Die Gäste wähnten sich im Finish dank „Joker“ Igor Paixao (80.) bereits im Halbfinale, ehe Roma-Star Paulo Dybala sich gegen Trauner durchsetzte und mit dem 2:1 (89.) die Verlängerung erzwang.\nDort wurden Stephan El Shaarawy (101.) und Lorenzo Pellegrini (108.) zu den Matchwinnern. Die Roma kann im Jahr nach dem Triumph in der Conference League nun auch vom Titel in der zweithöchsten Kategorie träumen. Im Halbfinale kommt es zum Duell mit Leverkusen.\nDie AS Roma setzte sich gegen Feyenoord Rotterdam (mit Gernot Trauner) mit 4:1 nach Verlängerung (Hinspiel: 0:1) durch.\nJuventus ging in Lissabon, beflügelt von der Suspendierung des 15-Punkte-Abzugs in der Serie A Stunden davor, dank Adrien Rabiot (9.) in Führung, musste nach dem 1:0 im Hinspiel aber hart arbeiten. Denn die Portugiesen fanden durch den Foulelfer von Marcus Edwards (20.) die richtige Antwort und hatten noch Chancen auf den Führungstreffer.\nDen Italienern reichte am Ende ein 1:1 bei Sporting Lissabon zum Aufstieg ins Halbfinale.\nLeverkusen führte in Brüssel dank Traumstarts durch Moussa Diaby (2.) und später Mitchel Bakker (37.) sowie Jeremie Frimpong (60.) mit 3:0 und ließ sich den Aufstieg nicht mehr nehmen. Zudem traf Adam Hlozek (79.) für die Deutschen, Casper Terho (65.) erzielte das Ehrentor.\nred, ORF.at/Agenturen'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Bayer könnte gleich zwei Ziele erreichen.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtm-b7nea\nSpätestens wenn die zweite Hälfte des Aprils anbricht, beginnt im Fußball immer auch die Zeit der historischen Bezüge. Weil Halbfinals und Endspiele nahen, werden Erinnerungen an unvergessene Siege, an verpasste Chancen und an große Mannschaften lebendig, auch in Leverkusen ist das nicht anders. Der rheinische Werksklub hat an diesem Donnerstagabend (21.00 Uhr im F.A.Z.-Liveticker zur Europa League und bei RTL) in Brüssel im Duell mit Union Saint-Gilloise die Chance, zum vierten Mal in seiner Klubgeschichte das Halbfinale eines Europapokals zu erreichen.\nZuletzt vollbrachte Bayer 04 dieses Kunststück 2002, als die Reise der legendären Mannschaft um Michael Ballack, Lucio und Bernd Schneider über den Kontinent bis ins Champions-League-Finale gegen Real Madrid führte. „Es ist natürlich eine Riesenmotivation, dass wir zum ersten Mal seit 2002 wieder in das Halbfinale eines Europapokals kommen können“, sagt Sportdirektor Simon Rolfes, entsprechend entschlossen wird das Projekt angegangen.\nObwohl es auch in der Bundesliga um viel geht, schont Trainer Xabi Alonso regelmäßig an den Wochenenden wichtige Spieler, um auf internationalem Terrain möglichst starke Leistungen wahrscheinlicher zu machen. Zuletzt folgte er dieser Strategie beim 0:0 in Wolfsburg am Sonntag. Dort saßen mit Jonathan Tah, Amine Adli, Mitchel Bakker und vor allem Florian Wirtz vier Spieler auf der Bank, die in den wirklich wichtigen Partien meist zur Startelf zählen.\nDiese finden derzeit eben in der Europa League statt. Schließlich können hier mit einem Gewinn des Titels gleich zwei Ziele auf einmal erreicht werden: ein Erfolg für die Fußball-Ewigkeit und die Qualifikation für die kommende Champions-League-Spielrunde, die von zentraler Bedeutung für die mittelfristige Entwicklung des Klubs ist. „Wir haben eine Superchance“, sagt Alonso zu den Aussichten nach dem 1:1 im Viertelfinalhinspiel gegen die Belgier.\nWährend der vergangenen Jahrzehnte wurde dieser Wettbewerb unterhalb der geradezu kultisch verehrten Champions League in Deutschland nicht immer mit der angemessenen Wertschätzung betrachtet. Erst der Titelgewinn von Eintracht Frankfurt im vergangenen Jahr und die Einsicht, dass auch hier wirklich große Europapokalabende möglich sind, hat das Ansehen des Wettbewerbs grundlegend verändert.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nLeverkusen-Gegner Saint-Gilloise\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoker-Milliardär spielt „Moneyball“\nTrainer von Bayer Leverkusen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie beeindruckende Souveränität des Xabi Alonso\n0:0 in Wolfsburg\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBundesliga-Siegesserie der Leverkusener ist gerissen\nBayer Leverkusen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t„Ein Halbfinale gibt es nicht for free“\nUnd weil die Bedeutung der Europa League in der spanischen Heimat des Leverkusener Trainers Alonso schon viel früher erkannt worden ist, könnte sich nun eine interessante Kombination ergeben: In Leverkusen blüht die Hoffnung auf den zweiten europäischen Titel seit dem Erfolg im UEFA-Cup 1988, und der Trainer vermittelt die passende Haltung. „Jetzt Vollgas“, sagt Alonso mit Blick auf das Rückspiel gegen die zähen Belgier, die der Werkself in Leverkusen ein 1:1 abtrotzten. Die Zuversicht im Team ist groß, auch weil im Fußball das gern beschworene Momentum für den letzten Bundesligaklub im Wettbewerb spricht.\nNach dem schwachen Saisonstart gehören die Leverkusener zu den stärksten Teams in Deutschland, der Trainer ist endgültig im Klub angekommen, und Moussa Diaby sagt: „Bayer 04 hat die Spieler, um die Europa League zu gewinnen.“ Zudem ist Alonso, der zweimal die Champions League sowie die Weltmeisterschaft und ebenfalls zweimal die Europameisterschaft gewann, gut vertraut mit den Mechanismen sehr großer Spiele.\nUnd Wirtz, von dem die meisten Experten glauben, er habe eine Weltkarriere vor sich, kann jederzeit praktisch aus dem Nichts entscheidende Situationen hervorzaubern. So wie im Hinspiel gegen Saint-Gilloise, als er mit einem prachtvollen Schuss zum 1:1 traf. Es war schon sein siebtes Tor in der Europa League, seit dem großen Brasilianer Ronaldo Mitte der 1990er-Jahre hat kein Teenager mehr so viele Tore in diesem Wettbewerb geschossen. Was noch fehlt, sind allerdings die rauschhaften Europapokalabende, die die Würze einer großen Saison sind.\nWährend der SC Freiburg gegen Juventus Turin und Union Berlin gegen Ajax Amsterdam gespielt und eine tolle Gruppenphase erlebt haben, stolperte Bayer 04 im Herbst durch die Champions League. Das bisherige Leverkusener Highlight war der Sieg im Elfmeterschießen bei der AS Monaco, im atmosphärisch eher trostlosen Stadion Louis II an der Côte d’Azur, wo nur 8504 Zuschauer zugegen waren.\nWas den Erlebniswert betrifft, gibt es also noch Nachholbedarf. Sollte Bayer Leverkusen nun allerdings im Brüsseler Stadtteil Anderlecht die nächste Runde erreichen, wäre ein besonderes Erlebnis sicher: Gegner im vierten Halbfinale eines Europacups für Leverkusen nach 1988, 1995 und 2002 wäre entweder der souveräne niederländische Tabellenführer Feyenoord Rotterdam oder der letztjährige Conference-League-Sieger AS Rom mit Trainer José Mourinho.\nQuelle: F.A.Z.\nHier können Sie die Rechte an diesem Artikel erwerben.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtm-b7nea\nWeitere Themen\nKritik an DFL und Leverkusen\n                                \n: \n\nÄrger beim 1.

Bei zahlreichen Topklubs hat sich der Niederländer bereits auf das Transferradar gespielt haben. Dennoch glauben die VfL-Verantwortlichen daran, dass sie den 21-Jährigen noch halten können.\nDurchgesetzt: Micky van de Ven im Duell mit Leverkusens Moussa Diaby (re.).\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/regios24\nEs gibt nur noch zwei Feldspieler in dieser bald zu Ende gehenden Bundesligasaison, die noch nicht eine Spielminute verpasst haben: Freiburgs erfahrener Weltmeister Matthias Ginter (29) - und Wolfsburgs Shootingstar Micky van de Ven. Am Mittwoch feiert der Niederländer seinen erst 22. Geburtstag, für Trainer Niko Kovac ist er dennoch bereits eine unverzichtbare Größe. ""Mein Herz lacht, ich freue mich, ich bin begeistert"", gerät der Förderer auf kicker-Nachfrage ins Schwärmen. ""Micky ist ein toller Junge, ein richtig guter Fußballer."" Der mit seinen Auftritten Begehrlichkeiten weckt und die Frage aufwirft: Wie lange verteidigt er noch für den VfL?\nMarcel Schäfer gibt sich ganz entspannt bei dieser Thematik. Einerseits, weil der Geschäftsführer den Vertrag mit dem Innenverteidiger gerade erst bis 2027 und ohne Ausstiegsklausel verlängert hat. Andererseits, weil es zur VfL-Philosophie gehören soll, dass Spieler wie van de Ven, der im Sommer 2021 für 3,5 Millionen Euro vom damaligen Zweitligisten FC Volendam kam, nach entsprechender positiver Entwicklung in Wolfsburg mit sattem Gewinn verkauft werden. Der Niederländer soll, so der Wunsch, eines Tages zum Gesicht dieser Strategie werden. Van de Ven hält seine Zukunft trotz Verlängerung offen und bestätigte unlängst das Interesse anderer Klubs. Er sagt: ""Man weiß nie, was die Zukunft bringt.""\nVor allem viel Geld muss derjenige mitbringen, der den Abwehrmann verpflichten möchte. Boss Schäfer beschreibt die Vorzüge seines Spielers: ""Linksfuß, extremes Tempo, spielt jede Sekunde. Micky bringt über die ganze Saison konstant sehr gute Leistungen."" Und hat, wie der Manager und auch Coach Kovac betonen, trotzdem noch reichlich Entwicklungspotenzial. Gleichwohl ragt der 1,93-Meter-Mann schon jetzt heraus, ist mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 35,97 km/h der schnellste Innenverteidiger der Liga. Am Sonntag gegen Leverkusen (0:0) nahm er es ohne Probleme mit Bayers Topsprintern Moussa Diaby, den Xabi Alonso zur zweiten Hälfte dann lieber auf die linke Seite verschob, und Jeremie Frimpong auf. ""Das war à la bonne heure"", schwärmt Kovac, ""was er im Moment zeigt, ist schon außerordentlich."" Und wird europaweit registriert.\nDass es Interesse an van de Ven gibt, ist den Wolfsburger Entscheidern bekannt, offizielle Anfragen gebe es aber noch keine. Vor allem interessierte Klubs aus England können sich aber schon mal daran orientieren, was auf der Insel zuletzt so für Innenverteidiger über den Tisch ging. Chelsea zahlte für Wesley Fofana (22) stolze 80 Millionen Euro an Leicester City, van de Vens Landsmann Sven Botman (23), wie der Wolfsburger ein Linksfuß, war Newcastle United beim Wechsel von Lille in die Premier League 37 Millionen Euro wert. Kurzum: Unter 40 Millionen wird bei entsprechender Entwicklung nach kicker-Informationen kaum etwas gehen.\nLiebend gerne würde Wolfsburg seinen Emporkömmling aber mindestens noch ein Jahr halten. Und sieht dafür nicht nur wegen van de Vens signalisierter Bereitschaft (""Die Chance ist groß"") durchaus gute Argumente für sich. ""Ich vermute"", sagt Schäfer, ""ohne, dass ich mit ihm gesprochen habe, dass die Nationalmannschaft ein Thema werden kann für ihn. Nächstes Jahr ist ein großes Turnier, vorher ist es immer der wichtigste Faktor, dass du spielst, unangefochtener Stammspieler bist. Ich glaube, diese Perspektive können wir ihm auch im nächsten Jahr bieten.""\nHält die EM in Deutschland van de Ven, der es im Winter schon in den vorläufigen WM-Kader geschafft hatte, beim VfL? ""Micky hat eine große Karriere vor sich, wenn er gesund und normal bleibt"", ist Niko Kovac überzeugt. ""Ich drücke ihm die Daumen."" Zu gerne würde der Trainer seinen Shootingstar aber noch über den Sommer hinaus fördern. ""Er muss noch ein paar Jahre hierbleiben"", wünscht sich der 51-Jährige, ""dann kann er irgendwann gehen …""\nThomas Hiete\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Moussa Diaby,de
"{'content': 'Die Siegesserie von Bayer Leverkusen ist gerissen. Für das Team von Trainer Xabi Alonso reichte es im Auswärtsspiel am Sonntag beim VfL Wolfsburg nur zu einem 0:0, zuvor hatte Bayer fünfmal in Folge in der Fußball-Bundesliga gewonnen. Das torlose Remis taugt auch nur bedingt als Mutmacher für das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der Europa League am kommenden Donnerstag bei Union Saint-Gilloise (Hinspiel 1:1). In der Bundesliga-Tabelle bleibt Leverkusen Sechster, der VfL belegt mit vier Punkten Rückstand weiter den neunten Platz.\nBayer-Coach Alonso rotierte im Vergleich zur Europacup-Partie gegen den belgischen Club Union Saint-Gilloise auf fünf Positionen und ließ unter anderem die Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz und Jonathan Tah zunächst auf der Bank. ""Heute brauchen wir etwas anderes"", sagte der Weltmeister von 2010 vor dem Anpfiff.\nAllerdings merkte man der zuletzt besten Bundesliga-Mannschaft die hohe Belastung durch die internationalen Spiele merklich an. Die langen Bälle auf die von VfL-Trainer Niko Kovac als ""flinken Jungs"" bezeichneten Offensiv-Stars um Moussa Diaby kamen nur selten an. Von der Spielfreude der vergangenen Wochen war kaum etwas zu sehen. Die beste Gelegenheit in der ersten halben Stunde besaß Adam Hlozek. Der Tscheche traf zwar die Latte, Passgeber Jeremie Frimpong stand jedoch zuvor im Abseits (27.).\nNicht viel besser machten es die Wolfsburger, die die vorherigen fünf Heimspiele nicht gewinnen konnten. Ohne den erkrankten Kapitän Maximilian Arnold fehlte vor 20.137 Zuschauern Power im Mittelfeld. Die beste und einzige VfL-Chance vor der Pause hatte Yannick Gerhardt, dessen Kopfball knapp über das Tor von Bayer-Torhüter Hradecky ging (33.).\nBeide Teams kamen deutlich schwungvoller aus der Kabine und es gab im Vergleich zur ersten Hälfte Tor-Möglichkeiten. Wolfsburgs Angreifer Omar Marmoush scheiterte an Hradecky (47.). Auf der Gegenseite parierte Koen Casteels einen Diaby-Schuss (53.) glänzend mit dem Fuß.\nBayer-Coach Alonso brachte nach knapp einer Stunde Offensiv-Star Wirtz. Mit der Einwechslung des 19 Jahren alte Ausnahmetalents wurde Bayer dominanter und legte die Europa-League-Strapazen immer weiter ab. Einen Schlenzer von Kerem Demirbay klärte VfL-Keeper Casteels zur Ecke.\nAllerdings blieb die kurze Offensiv-Phase der Alonso-Elf ohne Wirkung. Wolfsburg befreite sich und hatte durch den eingewechselten Patrick Wimmer die Chance auf den Siegtreffer. Der Offensivspieler scheiterte aber am gut reagierenden Hradecky. Auf der Gegenseite vergab Amine Adli (88.).\nBeim Jubiläum von Trainer Urs Fischer hat der 1. FC Union Berlin einen großen Schritt Richtung Champions League verpasst. Im 200. Pflichtspiel ihres Trainers an der Seitenlinie kamen die Eisernen am Sonntag gegen den VfL Bochum nur zu einem 1:1 (1:0). Josip Juranovic (45.+3 Minute) brachte die Gastgeber im Stadion an der Alten Försterei mit einem sehenswerten Freistoßtor in Führung. Kevin Stöger (55.) erzielte per Foulelfmeter aber den Ausgleich für den Revierclub.\nIn der Schlussphase mühten sich Berliner trotz Unterzahl nach der Gelb-Roten-Karte für Paul Jaeckel (62.) noch um den Siegtreffer. Immerhin konnte die imposante Serie von ungeschlagenen Heimspielen auf 20 Partien ausgebaut werden. Union zog durch das Remis wieder an RB Leipzig auf den dritten Platz der Fußball-Bundesliga vorbei, hat mit 52 Punkten aber nur einen Zähler Vorsprung auf die Sachsen und zwei auf den SC Freiburg, der als Fünfter jenseits der Königsklassen-Ränge steht. Bochum konnte durch den wacker erkämpften Punkt als 15. den Vorsprung auf die Abstiegszone auf drei Zähler ausbauen.\nViel ""Schärfe"" hatte Fischer in dem Duell mit dem Revierclub erwartet. Mit Schmackes legte wie vom Schweizer erhofft sein Team los. Rani Khedira wurde gleich beim ersten Angriff gerade noch von einem Gegenspieler am Einschuss gehindert. Danilho Doekhis Versuch nach dem folgenden Eckball ging über das Tor. Der Niederländer hatte kurz darauf eine weitere Chance, doch der Schuss geriet zu lasch.\nBochums Zutaten für einen attraktiven frühen Fußball-Abend waren limitiert. Ambitionen auf einen eigenen Torerfolg wurden erstmal hinten angestellt. In der Bochumer Defensive musste der Ex-Unioner Keven Schlotterbeck (12.) früh mit Verdacht auf eine Knieverletzung raus, für ihn kam der aktuell aus Berlin ausgeliehene Dominique Heintz.\nDa sich die Berliner gegen die Körperlichkeit des VfL schwertaten, geriet das Spiel zäh. Kevin Behrens, der sich als Zielspieler im Duell mit Bochums Blocker Ivan Ordets mächtig aufrieb, setzte einen Kopfball (20.) am Tor vorbei.\nFischer wirkte ziemlich unruhig, fast schon genervt. Nach einem Wortdisput mit Schiedsrichter Tobias Stieler über eine offenkundig falsche Einwurf-Entscheidung bearbeitete der Coach ein großes freigetretenes Rasenstück direkt vor seiner Trainerbank mit Händen und Füßen.\nUnweit des geflickten Grüns setzte Jerome Roussillon (37.) wenig später zu einer Flanke an, die verunglückte und wurde gerade dadurch gefährlich. Das Winken zur Entwarnung von VfL-Torwart Manuel Riemann war jedenfalls verfrüht. Der Ball klatschte auf die Latte.\nEinen Glücksschuss brauchten die Unioner –\xa0und sie bekamen ihn. In der Nachspielzeit trat Juranovic aus rund 25 Metern in zentraler Position zum Freistoß an und zirkelte den Ball über die Bochumer Mauer ins Tor. Haltbar für Riemann? Bayern-Schlussmann Yann Sommer hätte für ein vergleichbar nutzloses Fliegen in München sicher eine Torwart-Diskussion an der Backe.\nBochum musste nun mehr tun. Und, sieh an, sie taten mehr. Patrick Osterhage (47.) setzte eine Art Warnschuss knapp neben den Torwinkel. Ein ziemlich ungeschicktes Einsteigen von Aïssa Laïdouni gegen Ordets führte zum unstrittigen Elfmeterpfiff Stielers. Stöger schoss zum Ausgleich ein. Fischers Laune wurde noch schlechter, als sich Jaeckel für ein zweites plumpes Foul die Gelb-Rote Karte einhandelte. Der Union-Jubel über ein vermeintliches Eigentor von Riemann (66.) nach Schuss von Behrens war wertlos. Der Video-Referee erkannte eine Abseitsposition. Kurz vor Schluss hatte Behrens eine weitere Chance zum Sieg (85.).\nVergleichsportal\nGutscheine für Sport-Shops\n\n\n© G+J Medien GmbH\nZugang zu allen STERN PLUS-Inhalten und Artikeln aus dem Print-Magazin\nwerbefrei & jederzeit kündbar\nBereits registriert?'}",Moussa Diaby,de

"{'content': 'Florian Wirtz machte nicht den Eindruck, als ob er mit sich hadern würde. „Natürlich“ hätte er sich „eine bessere Ausgangslage gewünscht“, sagte das Ausnahmetalent von Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Doch auch so sei er sich sicher, dass die Reise der Werkself durch Europa noch nicht zu Ende sei. „Ich bin mir sicher, dass wir das Rückspiel gewinnen werden“, erklärte der 19-Jährige nach dem 1:1 (0:0) im Hinspiel des Viertelfinals der Europa League gegen Union Saint-Gilloise am Donnerstagabend. Was ihn so zuversichtlich mache, wurde Wirtz gefragt. Aus seiner Antwort sprach gebündeltes Selbstvertrauen: „Weil wir eine richtig geile Mannschaft haben, weil unsere Qualität und unser Kampfgeist belohnt werden. Jeder von uns will das schaffen.“\nSeit knapp 44 Jahren spielen die Leverkusener in der Bundesliga. Es hat Höhen und Tiefen gegeben, immer einen gewissen Neid wegen der Finanzierung durch den Bayer-Konzern. Es gab Spott für knapp verpasste Titel („Vizekusen“), aber auch Lob für kultivierten Fußball und die Entwicklung von Talenten. Für eines jedoch stand Leverkusen nie: für Mentalität.\nDas jedoch ist in dieser Saison anders. Auch wenn sich die Mannschaft mit den defensivstarken Belgiern schwertat – keine andere deutsche Mannschaft arbeitet derzeit so zielstrebig an ihrer Weiterentwicklung wie die von Bayer. Seit zehn Pflichtspielen ist sie unbesiegt. Was nach einem völlig verpatzten Start in die Bundesligasaison mit fünf Niederlagen am Stück und acht sieglosen Spielen in Folge außerhalb jeder Vorstellungskraft lag, erscheint mittlerweile wieder realistisch: Mit einem Sieg am Sonntag beim VfL Wolfsburg (19.30 Uhr, DAZN und im WELT-Liveticker) könnte der aktuell Tabellensechste seine Ausgangsposition im Kampf um die Champions-League-Plätze abermals verbessern.\nZu verdanken wäre dies, darüber gibt es keine zwei Meinungen, allen voran Xabi Alsonso. Am 5. Oktober war der Baske auf den Schweizer Gerardo Seoane gefolgt. Damals war Bayer Vorletzter. Dann ging es aufwärts. Dabei war Alsonsos Vorgehensweise keineswegs revolutionär. Der 41-Jährige, der nach seiner erfolgreichen Spielerkarriere im Erwachsenenbereich nur die zweite Mannschaft von Real Sociedad San Sebastián trainiert hatte, griff auf Mittel zurück, die wohl viele Trainer in vergleichbaren Situationen gewählt hätten.\nEr stabilisierte die Defensive – auch mit Griffen in die taktische Mottenkiste. Er zog einen Mittelfeldspieler mit in die Abwehr und ließ ihn fast schon eine Art Libero spielen. So gab er dem verunsicherten Team Sicherheit. „Man muss nicht spektakulär spielen“, sagte er. Alsonso hielt die Spieler an, das zu spielen, was sie am besten können: auf Konter. So wurde die Last der Verantwortung, die unter Seoane, dessen Stil mehr auf Ballbesitz ausgerichtet war, zu spüren war, deutlich geringer. Zudem konnte so die Tatsache, dass Torjäger Patrick Schick wegen hartnäckiger Leistenprobleme fast durchgehend fehlte, kompensiert werden.\nStattdessen zeigten andere Profis ihre Qualitäten. Die schnellen Flügelspieler Jeremie Frimpong, Moussa Diaby (rechts) und Amine Adli (links) wurden zu Bayers schärfsten Waffen. Der Franzose Adli, 22, erzielte fünf Pflichtspieltreffer, sechs Tore bereitete er vor. Der Niederländer Frimpong, 22, kommt auf acht Treffer und neun Vorbereitungen. Für Diaby, der es sogar in Frankreichs WM-Kader schaffte, stehen sogar 13 Treffer und neun Vorbereitungen zu Buche. Der 23-Jährige hat sich zu einem der begehrtesten Transferobjekte Europas entwickelt. Manchester United hat bereits sein Interesse signalisiert.\nAus dem, was Alonso zunächst unter dem Oberbegriff „Schadensbegrenzung“ eingeleitet hat, ist längst unterhaltsamer, offensiver Fußball geworden. In den vergangenen Wochen machte die Mannschaft noch mal einen Sprung: Wirtz, der bis zur WM-Pause wegen eines Kreuzbandrisses außer Gefecht war, kommt immer besser in Form. Dank seiner Pässe ist Bayer nun für die Gegner noch schwerer auszurechnen. Gegen Saint-Gilles rettete der Techniker zumindest den einen Punkt – und die Hoffnung auf das Halbfinale.\nDie Fans sind begeistert. Das war am Donnerstag nach dem Schlusspfiff spürbar, als das Team mit viel Applaus verabschiedet wurde. Es ist lange her, dass sich Leverkusen so stimmungs- und hoffnungsvoll präsentiert hat wie derzeit. Bereits die Ankunft des Mannschaftsbusses an der BayArena vor dem Spiel war zu einem Spektakel geworden: Er wurde von Tausenden Fans in Empfang genommen.\nDie positive Atmosphäre genießt vor allem Fernando Carro. Der Spanier, seit knapp fünf Jahren Geschäftsführer der Bayer 04 Fußball GmbH, hatte sich schon darauf eingestellt, im kommenden Sommer Spieler verkaufen zu müssen. „Wir müssen Transfererträge erzielen. Besonders abhängig davon, ob wir international spielen oder nicht“, hatte er Ende vergangenen Jahres gesagt – als eine erneute Europapokal-Teilnahme vermeintlich illusorisch war. Dass dies mittlerweile anders aussieht, könnte seinen Spielraum erweitern und zumindest eine bessere Verhandlungsposition bedeuten – wenn, wie zu erwarten, die Topklubs wegen Diaby oder Wirtz vorstellig werden.\nZu verdanken hätten die Leverkusener dies vor allem Alsonso, der gleich bei seiner ersten größeren Cheftrainerposition das erkennen lässt, was mehrere prominente Trainer und Funktionäre schon immer geahnt hatten. José Mourinho, der Alonso in Madrid trainierte, sagte, dass der damalige Weltklasse-Mittelfeldspieler schon damals „wie ein Trainer“ gedacht habe.\n„Ich wette, dass er Trainer sein wird, wo immer er auch will“, hatte einige Jahre darauf Pep Guardiola über Alonso gesagt – als der sein Spieler beim FC Bayern war. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, der ehemalige Vorstandschef der Bayern, hatte unlängst erklärt, dass er vor einigen Jahren vergeblich versucht hatte, ihn als Co-Trainer nach München zu holen. „Ich habe es mir immer gewünscht, dass er eines Tages Trainer wird“, so Rummenigge.\nMittlerweile ist Xabi Alonso auf bestem Weg, sein Gesellenstück zu machen. Zugute kommt ihm dabei die Aura, als Spieler so ziemlich alles gewonnen zu haben: Er wurde spanischer und deutscher Meister, gewann mit Liverpool und Real Madrid die Champions League und mit Spanien die Welt- und zweimal die Europameisterschaft. Das sichert ihm Autorität in der Kabine.\nDoch darauf ruht er sich nicht aus. In Leverkusen fällt er dadurch auf, dass er permanent arbeitet – mit der Mannschaft und anschließend, nach dem Team-Training, auch häufig mit einzelnen Spielern. Er will jeden Profi besser machen. Wenn dann noch Zeit bleibt, versucht Xabi Alsonso, sein bereits rechts passables Deutsch zu verbessern. Letzteres, verriet er kürzlich der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“, falle ihm immer noch am schwersten. Er sei skeptisch, ob es ihm jemals gelingen wird, „der, die, das“ korrekt zu verwenden.\n\nDie WELT als ePaper: Die vollständige Ausgabe steht Ihnen bereits am Vorabend zur Verfügung – so sind Sie immer hochaktuell informiert.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nDer 19 Jahre alte Florian Wirtz hat gegen Saint-Gilloise längst nicht alles richtig gemacht - aber nie aufgehört, es besser machen zu wollen.\nGegen den vermeintlichen Außenseiter Union Saint-Gilloise muss ein Präzisionsschuss des Teenagers ein prekäres Remis retten. Erst in der Schlussphase sieht die Bayer-Elf wie der Favorit für den Einzug ins Halbfinale aus.\nVon Philipp Selldorf, Leverkusen\nDer Mann, den Robert Andrich soeben im Gespräch mit den Reportern als ""schönen Tanker"" bezeichnet hatte, stand bloß ein paar Meter von dem Urheber des skurrilen Kompliments entfernt und war seinerseits damit beschäftigt, eine weitere Gruppe von Berichterstattern über das Treffen zwischen Bayer Leverkusen und Union Saint-Gilloise zu informieren. Die Partie endete 1:1, und Victor Boniface, die Nummer 7 in der Startelf des belgischen Tabellenzweiten, hatte zu den Hauptfiguren der Europa-League-Begegnung gezählt. Er hatte das Führungstor für die Gäste erzielt und dank seines zugleich leichtfüßigen wie baumstarken Auftretens beeindruckte Gegner\xa0hinterlassen.\n""Der Kraftraum wird bestimmt sein Freund sein"", hatte der Bayer-Anführer und heimliche Kapitän Andrich aus ehrlicher Überzeugung gemutmaßt, damit aber eine Falschmeldung in die Welt gesetzt, wie Boniface gleich darauf betonte: Er gehe - ""ehrlich gesagt"" - grundsätzlich nicht ins Gym, ""ich mag das nicht"". Und tatsächlich: Von der Tribüne aus mochte man den 22 Jahre alten Nigerianer für den jüngeren Bruder von Romelu Lukaku halten, aus der Nähe besehen erfüllt er bloß die Standardmaße eines athletischen Stürmers. Sein Geschick lässt ihn so außergewöhnlich wirken. Demnächst wird man ihn vermutlich in größeren Arenen erleben als im heimischen Stade Joseph Marien mit seinen 9400\xa0Plätzen.\nUnd noch mehr Chaos beim FC Bayern: Sadio Mané schlägt Leroy Sané und wird vorerst aus dem Kader gestrichen. Es ist ein Tiefpunkt nach enttäuschenden Monaten für den Angreifer, dessen Ankunft in München die Klubchefs so stolz verkündeten.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Sebastian Fischer\nWie man sich in dieser plötzlich bis in internationale Höhe emporgeschossenen Mannschaft eines jahrzehntelang bedeutungslosen Brüsseler Stadtteilklubs täuschen kann, das hatten die Leverkusener im ersten Akt des Viertelfinales immer wieder erfahren\xa0müssen.\nDas sowohl robuste wie spielerisch bewanderte und taktisch bestens organisierte Union-Team stellte eine noch anspruchsvollere Aufgabe dar, als die Leverkusener offenbar gedacht hatten. Wobei Bayer keineswegs den Eindruck erweckte, den Gegner zu unterschätzen oder mangelhaft über ihn informiert zu sein. Xabi Alonsos Elf nahm die Sache jederzeit ernst, ebendies lässt das letztlich leistungsgerechte Unentschieden so prekär\xa0erscheinen.\nDenn zur Wahrheit gehört auch, dass sich die Leverkusener gefreut hatten, als ihnen der vermeintliche Außenseiter zugelost wurde, zumal in einem Zweig, in dem ihnen Manchester United und Juventus Turin bis zum Endspiel erspart bleiben würden. Nun aber stand Victor Boniface in der BayArena und sagte: ""Oh ja, ich glaube daran, dass wir das Finale erreichen\xa0können.""\nKöpfchen im Fuß: Florian Wirtz trifft geschickt gegen drei Verteidiger der hartnäckigen Spieler von Union Saint-Gilloise\nFlorian Wirtz und seinem Präzisionsschuss in der 82. Minute verdankten es die Hausherren, dass sie nicht mit einem Rückstand zur zweiten Partie reisen müssen - wieder mal Florian Wirtz, wie gesagt werden muss. Der 19-jährige Spielmacher hatte längst nicht alles richtig gemacht an diesem Abend, aber er hat nie aufgehört, es besser machen zu\xa0wollen.\nHätte ihn Xabi Alonso ausgewechselt, hätte er dafür gute Gründe nennen können, der Trainer war jedoch so klug, über Fehler und Fehlentscheidungen in Wirtz\' Spiel hinwegzusehen. Unter anderem deshalb, weil er dem eingewechselten Stürmer Sardar Azmoun den Auftrag mitgegeben hatte, im Strafraum Bälle zu gewinnen, um sie für die nachrückenden Offensivspieler Wirtz oder Moussa Diaby zum Einschuss bereitzulegen. Und was geschah in der 82. Minute? Eben dies. ""Von der Qualität her ein Riesentor"", wie Andrich später mit Recht bemerkte: Torschütze und Vorlagengeber hatten gegen eine Überzahl von Gegnern mit winzigen Freiräumen zurechtkommen\xa0müssen.\nDieser Moment von besonderer Klasse und das stürmische Finale bis in die letzten Sekunden der Nachspielzeit ließ Bayer zum Schluss doch noch wie den Favoriten des Viertelfinales aussehen. Xabi Alonso fand sich anschließend in aufgeräumter Stimmung zur Lagebesprechung ein, das dünne 1:1 schien ihn nicht enttäuscht zu haben. ""Ein typisches Viertelfinale"", stellte er im Stil des weitgereisten Europacupexperten fest. Dieses Vorspiel dürften seine Fußballer gern als Mahnung auffassen, gab er zu verstehen: ""Die Tickets für das Halbfinale sind nicht for free - wir müssen sie verdienen."" Nach sechs Monaten bei Bayer 04 weiß er, dass dieses Leverkusener Team zu allem fähig sein mag - dass es aber die volle Spannung benötigt, um zur besten Leistung zu\xa0finden.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Erst in der Schlussphase sieht die Bayer-Elf wie der Favorit für den Einzug ins Halbfinale aus.\nVon Philipp Selldorf, Leverkusen\nDer Mann, den Robert Andrich soeben im Gespräch mit den Reportern als ""schönen Tanker"" bezeichnet hatte, stand bloß ein paar Meter von dem Urheber des skurrilen Kompliments entfernt und war seinerseits damit beschäftigt, eine weitere Gruppe von Berichterstattern über das Treffen zwischen Bayer Leverkusen und Union Saint-Gilloise zu informieren. Die Partie endete 1:1, und Victor Boniface, die Nummer 7 in der Startelf des belgischen Tabellenzweiten, hatte zu den Hauptfiguren der Europa-League-Begegnung gezählt. Er hatte das Führungstor für die Gäste erzielt und dank seines zugleich leichtfüßigen wie baumstarken Auftretens beeindruckte Gegner\xa0hinterlassen.\n""Der Kraftraum wird bestimmt sein Freund sein"", hatte der Bayer-Anführer und heimliche Kapitän Andrich aus ehrlicher Überzeugung gemutmaßt, damit aber eine Falschmeldung in die Welt gesetzt, wie Boniface gleich darauf betonte: Er gehe - ""ehrlich gesagt"" - grundsätzlich nicht ins Gym, ""ich mag das nicht"". Und tatsächlich: Von der Tribüne aus mochte man den 22 Jahre alten Nigerianer für den jüngeren Bruder von Romelu Lukaku halten, aus der Nähe besehen erfüllt er bloß die Standardmaße eines athletischen Stürmers. Sein Geschick lässt ihn so außergewöhnlich wirken. Demnächst wird man ihn vermutlich in größeren Arenen erleben als im heimischen Stade Joseph Marien mit seinen 9400\xa0Plätzen.\nUnd noch mehr Chaos beim FC Bayern: Sadio Mané schlägt Leroy Sané und wird vorerst aus dem Kader gestrichen. Es ist ein Tiefpunkt nach enttäuschenden Monaten für den Angreifer, dessen Ankunft in München die Klubchefs so stolz verkündeten.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Sebastian Fischer\nWie man sich in dieser plötzlich bis in internationale Höhe emporgeschossenen Mannschaft eines jahrzehntelang bedeutungslosen Brüsseler Stadtteilklubs täuschen kann, das hatten die Leverkusener im ersten Akt des Viertelfinales immer wieder erfahren\xa0müssen.\nDas sowohl robuste wie spielerisch bewanderte und taktisch bestens organisierte Union-Team stellte eine noch anspruchsvollere Aufgabe dar, als die Leverkusener offenbar gedacht hatten. Wobei Bayer keineswegs den Eindruck erweckte, den Gegner zu unterschätzen oder mangelhaft über ihn informiert zu sein. Xabi Alonsos Elf nahm die Sache jederzeit ernst, ebendies lässt das letztlich leistungsgerechte Unentschieden so prekär\xa0erscheinen.\nDenn zur Wahrheit gehört auch, dass sich die Leverkusener gefreut hatten, als ihnen der vermeintliche Außenseiter zugelost wurde, zumal in einem Zweig, in dem ihnen Manchester United und Juventus Turin bis zum Endspiel erspart bleiben würden. Nun aber stand Victor Boniface in der BayArena und sagte: ""Oh ja, ich glaube daran, dass wir das Finale erreichen\xa0können.""\nKöpfchen im Fuß: Florian Wirtz trifft geschickt gegen drei Verteidiger der hartnäckigen Spieler von Union Saint-Gilloise\nFlorian Wirtz und seinem Präzisionsschuss in der 82. Minute verdankten es die Hausherren, dass sie nicht mit einem Rückstand zur zweiten Partie reisen müssen - wieder mal Florian Wirtz, wie gesagt werden muss. Der 19-jährige Spielmacher hatte längst nicht alles richtig gemacht an diesem Abend, aber er hat nie aufgehört, es besser machen zu\xa0wollen.\nHätte ihn Xabi Alonso ausgewechselt, hätte er dafür gute Gründe nennen können, der Trainer war jedoch so klug, über Fehler und Fehlentscheidungen in Wirtz\' Spiel hinwegzusehen. Unter anderem deshalb, weil er dem eingewechselten Stürmer Sardar Azmoun den Auftrag mitgegeben hatte, im Strafraum Bälle zu gewinnen, um sie für die nachrückenden Offensivspieler Wirtz oder Moussa Diaby zum Einschuss bereitzulegen. Und was geschah in der 82. Minute? Eben dies. ""Von der Qualität her ein Riesentor"", wie Andrich später mit Recht bemerkte: Torschütze und Vorlagengeber hatten gegen eine Überzahl von Gegnern mit winzigen Freiräumen zurechtkommen\xa0müssen.\nDieser Moment von besonderer Klasse und das stürmische Finale bis in die letzten Sekunden der Nachspielzeit ließ Bayer zum Schluss doch noch wie den Favoriten des Viertelfinales aussehen. Xabi Alonso fand sich anschließend in aufgeräumter Stimmung zur Lagebesprechung ein, das dünne 1:1 schien ihn nicht enttäuscht zu haben. ""Ein typisches Viertelfinale"", stellte er im Stil des weitgereisten Europacupexperten fest. Dieses Vorspiel dürften seine Fußballer gern als Mahnung auffassen, gab er zu verstehen: ""Die Tickets für das Halbfinale sind nicht for free - wir müssen sie verdienen."" Nach sechs Monaten bei Bayer 04 weiß er, dass dieses Leverkusener Team zu allem fähig sein mag - dass es aber die volle Spannung benötigt, um zur besten Leistung zu\xa0finden.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Bayer Leverkusen darf weiter vom Einzug ins Halbfinale der  Europa League träumen.\nDie Werkself in der Einzelkritik.\nLUKAS HRADECKY: Hatte alles im Blick als ein Ball aus dem Mittelfeld auf die Querlatte tropfte. Starke Parade beim Schuss von Boniface (27.), die einzige echte Chance für den Kapitän, um sich auszuzeichnen. Machtlos beim 0:1 durch Boniface. Note 3.\nEDMOND TAPSOBA: Diesmal rechts in der Dreierkette. Versuchte das Spiel mit seinen Pässen anzukurbeln. Beim Gegentor alleine gegen zwei Gegner. Note 3.\nDer FC Liverpool will sich im Sommer angeblich mit einem Bayern-Star verstärken.\nJONATHAN TAH: Der Abwehrchef setzte seine zuletzt starken Leistungen auch gegen die Belgier fort. Enorme Präsenz in den Zweikämpfen, bester Leverkusener. Note 2.\nPIERO HINCAPIE: Der Ecuadorianer ließ über links nichts anbrennen, musste aber in der 40. Minute per Kopf das 1:0 erzielen. Note 3.\nJEREMIE FRIMPONG: Tolle Flanke auf Hincapie, wieder ständig unterwegs. Makel: Sein Kopfball in der 78. Minute musste das 1:1 sein. Note 3.\n\nPyro-Euphorie für Leverkusen Tausende Fans empfangen Mannschaftsbus\nEXEQUIEL PALACIOS: Der Argentinier spielte gewohnt bissig, ohne jedoch Akzente nach vorne setzen zu können. In der Pause angeschlagen raus. Note 3.\nROBERT ANDRICH: Einsatz und Leidenschaft wie immer vorbildlich. Diesmal aber mit einigen Fehlpässen. Rutschte vorm 0:1 aus. Note 4.\nMITCHEL BAKKER: Einziger neuer Spieler in der Startelf. Der Niederländer brauchte etwas Anlaufzeit, steigerte sich in der zweiten Hälfte deutlich. Seine Top-Flanken auf Frimpong (78.) und Azmoun (90. plus 4) hätten Tore verdient. Note 3.\nAMINE ADLI: Die Vorlage auf Moussa Diaby kurz vor der Pause war seine beste Szene. Diesmal allerdings ohne eigene gefährliche Offensiv-Aktion. Note 4.\n\nFlorian Wirtz küsste das Bayer-Wappen nach seinem 1:1\nFLORIAN WIRTZ: In der 7. Minute verfehlte er mit links knapp das Tor. Der Nationalspieler hatte nicht seinen besten Tag, sein Spiel war fehlerbehaftet. Mit seinem Traum-Schuss zum 1:1 zeigte Wirtz dann wieder seine ganze Klasse. Deshalb: Note 2.\nMOUSSA DIABY: Der Franzose verzog Sekunden vor dem Pausenpfiff nur um Zentimeter. Hatte es schwer gegen die gut organisierte Abwehr der Gäste, ackerte und rannte aber unermüdlich. Note 3.\nKEREM DEMIRBAY (ab 46. für Palacios): Zurück im Kader nach leichten Knie-Problemen aus dem Schalke-Spiel. Nahm sich der Standards an, versuchte es auch immer wieder aus der Distanz. Note 3.\nSARDAR AZMOUN (ab 67. für Adli): Nur vier Minuten nach seiner Einwechslung schien das Spiel für ihn schon wieder vorbei, der Iraner hatte sich offenbar vertreten. Mit ihm als zentralen Stürmer änderte sich die Statik, Bayer wurde immer gefährlicher. Starke Vorlage auf Wirtz. Sekunden vor Schluss fehlten ihm Zentimeter nach Bakkers Flanke. Note 3.\nADAM HLOZEK (87. für Diaby): Ohne Note.\nXABI ALONSO: Mit der Hereinnahme von Azmoun brachte der Spanier neuen Schwung ins Spiel. Sein Team zeigte nach dem Rückspiel eine große Moral und hält sich alle Chancen aufs Halbfinale. Unter Alonso ist die Siegesserie nach sieben gewonnenen Spielen zwar gerissen, Bayer blieb aber nach Pflichtpartien weiter unbesiegt.

"{'content': 'Mit Florian Wirtz (r.) holte Bayer Leverkusen 25 Punkte\n„Ich kann ihn nicht genug loben. Er bringt eine ganz andere Dimension in unser Spiel.“ Das sagte Leverkusens Kapitän Lukas Hradecky (33) in der Sendung „Die Lage der Liga“ bei BILD-TV über Top-Talent Florian Wirtz (19).\nDas Wirtz-Comeback machte aus Krisen-Bayer wieder einen Europa-Kandidaten. Der Aufschwung der Werkself wäre ohne den Nationalspieler kaum möglich gewesen.\nWie abhängig  Bayer Leverkusen von Wirtz ist, belegen die Zahlen eindrucksvoll. Seit Beginn des Jahres mischt Wirtz wieder mit – seither sammelte nur  Borussia Dortmund mehr Punkte (31) als Leverkusen (25). Die Folge: Bayer kletterte zuletzt ins obere Tabellendrittel, ist in der  Bundesliga nach dem 3:1 über Frankfurt Sechster.\n„Er hat einen großen Einfluss auf unser Spiel, die Qualität, unser Mittelfeld mit den Stürmern zu verbinden. Wenn wir ihn in gefährliche Situationen bringen, kann immer was passieren. Wir brauchen ihn für die Zukunft. Ich sehe, wie Flo solche Spiele genießt“, sagte Trainer Xabi Alonso (41) nach dem Frankfurt-Spiel.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (r.) gratuliert Amine Adli (M.) nach seinem Tor gegen Frankfurt\nEin Wahnsinn: Sieben Mal spielte Wirtz in dieser Saison von Beginn an, 6 dieser Spiele wurden gewonnen. Sieg-Quote: 86 Prozent. Nur bei der Heimpleite gegen Dortmund (0:2) am 18. Spieltag gab es mit Starter Wirtz keinen Dreier.\nFehlte das Supertalent in der Startelf in dieser Bundesliga-Saison, sah das ganz anders aus: In 20 Partien gab es nur einen Sieg mehr als in den 7 Spielen mit Wirtz in der Startelf – das ist eine Sieg-Quote von gerade mal 35 Prozent. Der Punkteschnitt mit Startspieler Wirtz ist 2,57. Ohne ihn: 1,25!\n\nFast über den halben Platz! Alonso feiert dieses Adli-Solo\nAuch die individuellen Werte sind beeindruckend: 6 Treffer legte er auf und ist damit hinter Dortmunds Raphael Guerreiro ligaweit der beste Vorlagengeber im Jahr 2023. Mit dieser Ausbeute ist er zudem gemeinsam mit Moussa Diaby und Jeremie Frimpong bester Vorbereiter von Leverkusen – die waren aber seit Saisonstart dabei.\nInsgesamt sammelte Wirtz nach der Winterpause in 11 Einsätzen 7 Scorer-Punkte, ist in diesem Zeitraum gemeinsam mit Frimpong die Nummer 1 bei Bayer – alle 99 Minuten war Wirtz in dieser Bundesliga-Saison an einem Tor beteiligt.\n\nBelgiens Nationaltrainer Domenico Tedesco warnt Bayer Leverkusen vor Union Saint-Gilloise in der Europa League.\nLukas Hradecky von Bayer Leverkusen erzählte bei BILD-TV von seinem größten Schreckmoment.\nBILD Gutscheine\nBILD Vergleich\nPartnerangebote'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Der junge Franzose ist der Aufsteiger des Kalenderjahres bei Bayer 04 - und erweitert das Offensiv-Spektrum von Trainer Xabi Alonso entscheidend.\nEbnete den Weg zum jüngsten Bayer-Sieg mit seinem Führungstor gegen Frankfurt: Amine Adli.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Mika Volkmann\nWenn Bayer 04 am Donnerstag (21 Uhr, LIVE! bei kicker) Union Royal Saint-Gilloise zum Hinspiel im Viertelfinale der Europa League in der Bay-Arena empfängt, wird Xabi Alonso wieder vor der Entscheidung stehen, welchen seiner Angreifer er für die Startelf nominiert.\nZwei der drei Plätze sind fix vergeben: Moussa Diaby als halbrechter Stürmer im 3-4-3 gilt ebenso gesetzt wie Florian Wirtz, der formell als Mittelstürmer aus dieser Position heraus die gegnerischen Abwehrspieler anläuft, allerdings bei Leverkusener Ballbesitz alle Freiheiten bekommt, aus der Tiefe heraus ordnend wie kreativ zu wirken.\nDie verbleibende halblinke Position hat im Moment eigentlich Amine Adli inne. Diese war ursprünglich das anfangs von Xabi Alonso für Wirtz vorgesehene Betätigungsfeld, das der 19-Jährige einnehmen sollte, wenn Bayer in Person von Patrik Schick oder Sardar Azmoun mit einem richtigen Mittelstürmer begann. Doch dieser in der Wintervorbereitung ausgeheckte Plan wurde von Adli im positiven Sinne über den Haufen geworfen.\nNach einem Seuchenjahr mit schwerer Sehnenverletzung im Oberschenkel sowie einem Schlüsselbeinbruch hat der 22-jährige Adli einen Riesensprung gemacht, ist mit wettbewerbsübergreifend elf Torbeteiligungen in diesem Kalenderjahr Bayers bester Scorer, gemeinsam mit Wirtz. Auch am Samstag beim 3:1 gegen Frankfurt sorgte er mit seinem Treffer für das wichtige 1:0.\nAdli ist im Moment unter Leistungsaspekten schwer aus Leverkusens Startelf wegzudenken. ""Die Winterpause war sehr gut für mich, weil ich viel an meiner Physis arbeiten und auf mein bestes Level zurückkommen konnte"", erklärt dieser sein Leistungshoch.\nMit ihm haben wir mehr Möglichkeiten im Angriff. Das ist sehr wichtig. Er hat einen Schritt nach vorne gemacht.\n""In diesem Jahr hat er sich von Anfang an sehr gut entwickelt. Er zeigt Hunger, Intensität und er hat diese Qualität. Wenn er beides mixen kann, sehen wir, was für ein guter Spieler er sein kann. Er hat seit Gladbach (dem ersten Spiel nach der Winterpause, Anm. d. Red.) sehr gut gespielt. Mit ihm haben wir mehr Möglichkeiten im Angriff. Das ist sehr wichtig. Er hat einen Schritt nach vorne gemacht"", lobt sein Trainer Adlis Sprung vom Talent zum echten Faktor.\nEinen solchen soll er auch am Donnerstag gegen Union Royal Saint-Gilloise darstellen. Gegen den Tabellenzweiten aus Belgien, der Union Berlin nach einem 3:3 im Hinspiel schließlich im Achtelfinal-Rückspiel souverän mit 3:0 ausschaltete, sieht der französische U-21-Nationalspieler die Werkself trotz des eigenen Laufs mit zuletzt acht Siegen und einem Unentschieden aus den jüngsten neun Pflichtspielen nicht klar im Vorteil.\n""Wir haben eine gute Stimmung. Wir haben viel Selbstvertrauen"", erklärt Adi, ""aber jedes Spiel ist anders. Wir müssen das Spiel mit der Mentalität wie gegen Frankfurt beginnen, es wird ein hartes Stück Arbeit."" Von einem Duell David gegen Goliath möchte er zurecht nichts wissen. ""Wir dürfen nicht vergessen, dass wir auch Schwächen gezeigt haben. Wir müssen so weitermachen wie zuletzt, aber wir sind sicher kein Favorit"", betont er.\nEine Einstellung, die angesichts der tatsächlichen Stärke des internationalen Nonames aus der Region Brüssel angebracht ist. Denn Saint-Gilles gilt als eine Mannschaft mit der Defensivstärke von Union Berlin, die aber über deutlich größere spielerische Möglichketen verfügt als der Tabellendritte der Bundesliga. Dies sollte Warnung genug sein.\nAdli selbst könnte am Donnerstag ein Schlüssel werden. Bietet er doch einen variablen Mix aus Schnelligkeit, extrem hoher Laufbereitschaft, häufigen Antritten in die Tiefe, mit denen eine kompakte Abwehr in Bewegung gebracht werden muss, sowie einen guten Zug zum Tor, wegen dem er im Notfall sogar schon als Mittelstürmer aushalf.\nDa Sardar Azmoun zuletzt seine Jokerrolle gut annehm und sowohl auf Schalke als auch gegen Frankfurt jeweils nach Einwechslung traf, würde es nicht überraschen, wenn Xabi Alonso auch gegen die Belgier Adli dem Iraner vorzieht. Auch wenn Azmoun als richtiger Mittelstürmer auf den ersten Blick gegen kompakte Gäste als die bessere Wahl erscheint.\nDas variable Spiel von Leverkusens Offensiv-Trio kommt dem lieber aus hängender Position heraus in die Spitze stoßenden Adli deutlich mehr entgegen als eine starre Aufgabe in vorderster Linie. Mit A-Nationalspieler Moussa Diaby und dessen französischem Landsmann besitzt Wirtz so zwei extrem flinke Optionen für Pässe in die Tiefe, die durch den rechten Schienenspieler Jeremie Frimpong zusätzlich erweitert werden.\nIn Sachen Konterspiel verfügt Xabi Alonso mit Adli nun über eine noch größere Bandbreite, wodurch es für die Gegner noch schwieriger wird. Je nachdem, ob der Trainer auf den spielenden Mittelstürmer Azmoun oder den laufwütigen, aber auch technisch starken Tiefstarter Adli setzt, kann Xabi Alonso so unterschiedliche Akzente setzen.\nZuletzt funktionierte die Variante mit Adli bestens. ""Im Moment haben wir ein gutes Zusammenspiel. Ich glaube, aber, dass wir es noch verbessern können"", urteilt dieser kritisch. Für die nächsten Leverkusener Gegner dürfte dies keine gute Nachricht sein.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Es war seine fünfte Verwarnung, weshalb er am Samstag im Heimspiel gegen Gladbach gesperrt fehlen wird. Kurios: Fast alle Gelben Karten erhielt Götze wegen Reklamationen beim Schiedsrichter.\nTrainer Oliver Glasner (li.) unzufrieden mit Mario Götzes Disziplinlosigkeit.\r\n\r\n                                        picture alliance / SVEN SIMON\nWas sich Mario Götze in diesem Kalenderjahr geleistet hat, ist schon ein Kunststück. In Leverkusen (1:3) sah er wegen Meckerns die fünfte Gelbe Karte, zuvor war ein Foul von Moussa Diaby an ihm nicht geahndet worden. So weit, so unspektakulär. Der Frust war verständlich, die Reaktion nicht. Zumal der Frankfurter Angriff noch lief, als sich Götze beim schwachen Schiedsrichter Robert Hartmann (kicker-Note 4,5) beschwerte.\nPikant ist die nun folgende Sperre im Heimspiel gegen Gladbach, weil Götzes Gelbe Karten fast alle auf Proteste beim Schiedsrichter zurückzuführen sind. Viermal in der Bundesliga und zweimal in der Champions League gegen Neapel sah er den Gelben Karton, weil er reklamierte. Ein weiteres Mal wurde er in Köln verwarnt, als er die schnelle Ausführung eines Freistoßes unterband.\nDie Disziplinlosigkeit des Weltmeisters ist auch Oliver Glasner ein Dorn im Auge. ""Es reicht jetzt"", sagte der Trainer schon Mitte März nach dem Spiel in Neapel, ""ich habe ihm unmittelbar auf dem Platz gesagt, dass das jetzt die letzte Gelbe Karte wegen Meckerns war."" Zu Herzen genommen hat sich Götze die Worte seines Trainers offenkundig nicht. Die neuerliche Gelbe Karte wegen Meckerns wollte Glasner nach dem Abpfiff nicht kommentieren. Stattdessen brach er angesäuert das Interview bei ""Sky"" ab: ""Sie wollen mich provozieren. Wir haben Osterfrieden, alles Gute, schöne Ostern.""\nEine vereinsinterne Strafe erhält Götze für sein wenig vorbildliches Verhalten nach kicker-Informationen nicht. Kurios: Zum ersten Mal in seiner Karriere muss Götze in der Bundesliga nun eine Gelbsperre absitzen - in 231 Bundesligaspielen für Borussia Dortmund und den FC Bayern hatte er insgesamt nur elf Verwarnungen erhalten. In der ersten Phase der Saison bis zur WM in Katar hatte Götze übrigens keine einzige Gelbe Karte gesehen.\nRätsel gibt auch Götzes Scorerstatistik in der Rückrunde auf. Während der 30-Jährige im Pokal gegen Darmstadt (4:2) und Union Berlin (2:0) zu großer Form auflief und vier Tore vorbereitete, sammelte er in der Liga noch keinen einzigen Scorerpunkt. Zuletzt legte er am 17. Spieltag in Freiburg einen Treffer auf. Dass die Eintracht in der Offensive zu sehr von Randal Kolo Muani abhängig ist, liegt auch an Götzes mangelnder Torgefährlichkeit. Gegen Gladbach wird ihn wahrscheinlich Daichi Kamada ersetzen. Bis auf einen Assist beim 1:1 in München ist der Japaner in der Bundesliga-Rückrunde allerdings ebenfalls noch ohne Scorerpunkt.\nJulian Franzke\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Der 39-Jährige spricht im Interview über seine Anfänge als Torwart, seinen wichtigsten Treffer und ekelhafte Gegenspieler. Außerdem verrät der Franke, wo seine kicker-Torjägerkanone heute steht.\nStefan Kießling erhält 2013 die Torjägerkanone aus den Händen Uwe Seelers.\r\n\r\n                                        imago images/Contrast\nBei welchem Verein haben Sie angefangen zu kicken?\nBeim TSV Eintracht Bamberg mit vier oder fünf Jahren.\nWaren Sie schon als Kind ein Torjäger?\nEigentlich ja, aber tatsächlich habe ich im Tor angefangen, ein Jahr dort gespielt. Mein Vater ist Torwart. Aber dann habe ich einmal im Feld gespielt und ein paar Tore gemacht. Toreschießen hat mehr Spaß gemacht als Bälle zu halten.\nHatten Sie ein Vorbild?\nAls Kind hatte ich kein klassisches Vorbild. Da ich keinen echten Lieblingsklub hatte, hatte ich damals nicht das eine Vorbild. Doch wer sich, als ich so 20 Jahre alt war, zu einem entwickelt hat, ist Basketballlegende Dirk Nowitzki. Das lag sich auch daran, dass ich ihn später kennenlernen durfte und wir seitdem auch engen Kontakt haben.\nWelches war Ihr wichtigstes Tor?\nMein Tor in der 90. Minute am letzten Spieltag der Saison 2012/13 zum 1:0-Endstand beim HSV. Das war für mich mein wichtigstes Tor, weil ich seitdem die kicker-Torjägerkanone zu Hause stehen habe.\nWer war Ihr bester Mitspieler?\nDa könnte ich viele nennen, weil ich so viele unglaubliche Mitspieler hatte. Nur einen zu nennen, ist eigentlich nicht fair. Aber wenn ich mich auf einen festlegen muss, würde ich Bernd Schneider nehmen - einen der besten deutschen Fußballer, die es je gab. Sein Ehrgeiz, sein Auge, seine technischen Fähigkeiten - und er hat sich immer die Lunge aus dem Leib gerannt. Das hat mir schon imponiert.\nWer war Ihr bester Gegenspieler?\nDa gab es einige, die unangenehm waren. Benficas Luizao war gefühlte 3,80 Meter groß, eine Kante vor dem Herrn, ein absolut unangenehmer Gegenspieler, aber total fair. Mit ihm hatte ich super Duelle. Aber auch Kyriakos Papadopoulos, der auf dem Platz ein ekelhafter Typ war, weil er dir einfach nur wehgetan hat.\nWelcher gegnerische Torwart war der beste?\nNatürlich Manuel Neuer. Da gibt es keine andere Antwort - auch wenn ich lange Zeit geführt habe in der Statistik ""Tore gegen Manuel Neuer"". Inzwischen hat mich Marco Reus aber, glaube ich, eingeholt.\nIch habe nichts geschenkt bekommen.\nWas war Ihre Stärke?\nMein Wille, mein Ehrgeiz, mein Einsatz, mein Kopfballspiel und der Instinkt, an der richtigen Stelle zu sein. Ich habe zwar auch ein paar Chancen liegen gelassen, aber das Näschen hatte ich. Und ich war ein absoluter Teamspieler.\nWas Ihre Schwäche?\nIch habe nichts geschenkt bekommen. In der Jugend nicht und auch als Profi nicht. Jeden Einsatz, der in meiner Statistik steht, habe ich mir hart erarbeitet. Natürlich hatte ich ein gewisses Talent, aber ich war nicht schnell wie Moussa Diaby, hatte keine Technik wie Lionel Messi. Ich musste mir alles über die Jahre Stück für Stück aneignen. Als wirkliche Schwäche würde ich die Schnelligkeit sehen, die kannst du dir nicht erarbeiten.\nWer ist der beste Torjäger aller Zeiten?\nLaut Statistik Gerd Müller. Aber wenn du dich ein Jahrzehnt lang mit ihm gemessen und dich in ein, zwei Spielzeiten mit ihm richtig duelliert hast - ohne, dass ich mich mit ihm auf eine Stufe stellen möchte - war Robert Lewandowski in den vergangenen Jahren in Deutschland schon der Torjäger schlechthin.\nWelchem Amateurklub sind Sie noch verbunden?\nEhrlicherweise gar keinem mehr, weil der TSV Eintracht Bamberg sich aufgelöst hat und mit dem FC Bamberg zum FC Eintracht Bamberg wurde. Natürlich kenne ich da noch einige Leute, aber verbunden bin ich mit dem Klub nicht mehr.\nKicken Sie gelegentlich noch?\nIch versuche es ab und an. Zuletzt habe ich mit der Traditionsmannschaft von Bayer 04 beim Hallenturnier in Regensburg gespielt. Sonst noch gelegentlich ein Mitarbeiter-Kick oder ein Duell im Fußballtennis mit unserem Team-Organisator Hans-Peter Lehnhoff.\nWo steht Ihre Torjägerkanone?\nSie hat vom ersten Tag an einen richtig prominenten Platz im Wohnzimmer: Wir haben ein längeres Sideboard, auf dem der große Fernseher steht, links davon steht die Spielkonsole und rechts die kicker-Torjägerkanone.\nInterview: Stephan von Nocks\nAktuell ist Stefan Kießling in seiner Funktion ""Koordination Lizenz"" für die Abläufe rund um die Werkself verantwortlich\r\n                    IMAGO/Jan Huebner\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Moussa Diaby,de
"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 4 min\nFindet immer wieder neue Schlupflöcher: Leverkusens Florian Wirtz (rechts) ist vermutlich das Beste, was seinem Profitrainer-Novizen Xabi Alonso passieren konnte.\nLeverkusen erobert durch ein 3:1 gegen Lieblingsgegner Frankfurt früher als gedacht den sechsten Platz. Und ergötzt sich weiter an der Inspiration des 19-jährigen Ausnahmetalents Florian Wirtz.\nVon Milan Pavlovic, Leverkusen\nManchmal ist die Wahrheit auch nur eine bessere Ausrede. Die Art, wie die Spieler von Eintracht Frankfurt über ihre Niederlage in Leverkusen sprachen, war ehrlich, aber im Grunde auch klubschädigend. Schließlich hatten die Hessen nicht gegen Manchester City, Neapel oder Real Madrid verloren, sondern gegen jenen Bundesligisten, der die Eintracht soeben vom sechsten Platz bugsiert hatte. ""In Leverkusen kann man schon verlieren"", sagte Kapitän Sebastian Rode und klang so ehrfürchtig, als hätte er in einer Kutsche einem ICE ... na gut, einem Thalys Platz machen müssen, weil der ja ohnehin schneller fährt und seltener\xa0stoppt.\n""Hier haben schon andere verloren, nicht zuletzt die Bayern, die auch mit dem Tempo Probleme hatten. Von daher gilt es, anderswo die Punkte zu holen"", sagte Rode jedenfalls und klang fast wie die Spieler des FC Bayern, die in den 1980ern vorschlugen, die Punkte von Haus aus dem 1. FC Kaiserslautern zuzusprechen, weil sie keine Lust auf die nächste nutzlose Reise zum Betzenberg\xa0hatten.\nSo nachvollziehbar Rodes Sätze im Affekt waren angesichts der achten Frankfurter Liga-Niederlage in Leverkusen in Serie, so fragwürdig war die Haltung, die sich dahinter versteckte: Frankfurt, das den Werksklub in der Hinrunde 5:1 gedemütigt hatte und noch vor sechs Wochen elf Punkte vor ihm lag, sah sich außer Stande, den vermeintlich übermächtigen Gegner zu stoppen. Aber ist es nicht die Aufgabe des Trainers, sich etwas auszudenken, um die Sprinter von Bayer 04 aus dem Takt zu bringen? Manchmal wirkte es so, als hätte die Gästespieler niemand über den Tempofußball der Leverkusener instruiert. Der Endstand (3:1) schmeichelte den Frankfurtern\xa0noch.\nDer 19-jährige Mittelfeldspieler treibt Leverkusen zu einem 3:1-Erfolg, von seiner Finesse profitiert die gesamte Mannschaft. Trainer Xabi Alonso blickt nun auf eine besondere Statistik - bei der Eintracht ist man arg angefasst. \n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Milan Pavlovic\nIn dieser wichtigen Phase der Saison ist bei beiden Teams etwas vorgefallen, über das zumindest in Frankfurt niemand reden will. Während Bayer-Trainer Xabi Alonso in diesen Tagen schon mal Küsschen an seine Spieler verteilt (so wie am Samstag an den agilen Amine Adli), wirkt Frankfurts Coach Oliver Glasner distanziert und seltsam angefasst. Im ersten Interview nach Spielschluss beantwortete er eine Frage mit den Worten: ""Sie wollen mich provozieren. Wir haben Osterfrieden. Alles Gute. Schöne Ostern."" Konnte man da noch glauben, der Österreicher habe - zumindest ansatzweise - scherzen wollen, wiederholte er den Satz kurz darauf in größerer Runde. Und\xa0entschwand.\nVielleicht war Glasner ja auch bloß in Gedanken bei einem seiner wichtigsten Akteure: Mario Götze hat seit seiner Rückkehr in die Bundesliga einige Erfolgserlebnisse gehabt. Unter der Woche war der 30-Jährige beim 2:0-Pokalsieg gegen Union Berlin inspiriert und inspirierend, gekonnt setzte er seinen kongenialen Stoßstürmer Randal Kolo Muani in Szene, der ohne Götze nur drei Viertel wert ist. Am Samstag war von dem Duo wenig zu sehen, stattdessen ermeckerte Götze sich seine fünfte gelbe\xa0Karte.\nDer bessere Spielmacher trug an diesem Tag ein Leverkusener Trikot: Florian Wirtz ließ sich nicht einschüchtern von einem fiesen Frankfurter Foul nach neun Sekunden. Der 19-jährige Feinfuß riss das Spiel an sich und servierte den Kollegen die beiden ersten Tore mundgerecht - und das in voller Bewegung und trotz der Nähe büffelartiger Gegenspieler. Beim 1:0 hatte er schon vorher geguckt, ob er Adli mit einem Direktpass in die Gasse schicken könnte. Konnte er, tat er; Adli rannte los und versenkte den Ball mit dem linken Außenrist knapp über Gästetorwart Trapp und knapp unter die Latte zur\xa0Führung.\nEin gebrauchter Tag: Der Frankfurter Mario Götze wurde vom 19-jährigen Florian Wirtz ausgestochen und handelte sich eine Gelb-Sperre ein.\nIn der 34. Minute legte sich Wirtz ein Anspiel 30 Meter vor dem gegnerischen Tor vor, schaute einmal hoch, sah, wie der flinke Moussa Diaby in den Vollsprint-Modus schaltete und spielte ihm den Ball zwischen zwei Frankfurter Verteidiger millimetergenau in den Lauf - und zwar so, dass sein Mitspieler weder abbremsen noch beschleunigen musste. Danach war Wirtz mehrfach knapp dran am Assist-Hattrick, doch entweder verdaddelten seine Mitspieler gute Ideen, oder Trapp lenkte einen kaum haltbaren Ball von Adli neben den Pfosten\xa0(43.).\nOft sehen Wirtz\' Ballaktionen wie kleine Tupfer aus, so unaufgeregt und beiläufig, dass man zunächst nicht merkt, dass sie so tief schneiden wie ein Skalpell. Fotografen versuchen meist vergeblich, das Können des Teenagers bildlich festzuhalten. Dabei sind sein Positionsspiel, die Dosierung seiner Pässe und der Sprints atemraubend. Wirtz ist das Beste, das dem Profitrainer-Novizen Alonso passieren konnte; so wie der bodenständige Alonso vermutlich der beste Trainer ist, den Wirtz derzeit haben\xa0könnte.\nObwohl sie in den elf Wochen seit dem Ende der Winterpause 16 Spiele bestreiten mussten, wirken die Leverkusener bisher nicht müde. Zuletzt brauchte Alonso nicht einmal die Hilfe von Spielern wie Kerem Demirbay, Callum Hudson-Odoi und Nadiem Amiri, und kaum jemand scheint den immer noch nicht fitten Torjäger Patrik Schick zu vermissen. Sie freuen sich vielmehr, neben dem FC Bayern der einzige Bundesligist im internationalen Wettbewerb zu sein - in der Europa League, wo es am Donnerstag im Viertelfinal-Hinspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise geht. Sie empfinden es auch nicht als Provokation, wenn man sie auf die veränderten Ziele dieser Saison anspricht und gestehen, in der Bundesliga nach oben zu\xa0spähen.\nMit einem lausbübischen Lächeln erklärte Mittelfeldarbeiter Robert Andrich den Vier-Punkte-Plan des Klubs: zunächst Platz sechs holen, ihn absichern ""und dann, im dritten und vierten Schritt, vielleicht irgendwann auf Platz vier gucken"", der bekanntlich die Champions-League-Zulassung garantieren würde. Gibt es momentan irgendetwas Unerwünschtes auf der rechten Rhein-Seite? Vermutlich nur die Gefahr, dass durch den Leverkusener Lauf sowohl Alonso als auch Wirtz früher statt später ins Visier von Vereinen wie Real Madrid geraten\xa0könnten.\nKein Spieler verkörpert die beim FC Bayern ersehnten Tugenden so sehr wie Joshua Kimmich. Sein ungewöhnlicher Ausbruch in Freiburg lässt vor dem Champions-League-Viertelfinale gegen Manchester City Rückschlüsse auf die Stimmung im Team zu.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Aber es mutete schon kurios an, wie leicht Oliver Glasner sich an diesem bitteren Samstag provoziert fühlte. Am Sky-Mikrofon missfiel dem Trainer von Eintracht Frankfurt nach dem 1:3 (0:2) bei Bayer Leverkusen die Frage über den früheren Weltmeister Mario Götze, der wegen Meckerns seine fünfte Gelbe Karte gesehen hatte. „Sie wollen mich provozieren“, sagte der Österreicher. Auf Nachfrage antwortete er nur: „Frohe Ostern.“ Und ging.\nWenige Minuten später auf der Pressekonferenz unterbrach Glasner dann einen Journalisten, der ihm eine keineswegs provokante Frage nach der Handlungsschnelligkeit stellte. „Ich lasse mich heute nicht provozieren. Das war schon vorher beim Interview so“, sagte er, nachdem er schon betont hatte, dass Ostern ein „Friedensfest“ ist: „Ich wünsche euch allen frohe Ostern. Feiert mit euren Familien.“ Dann stand er auf.\nBegonnen hatte Glasner jenes Statement mit den Worten, er sei „heute völlig entspannt“. Dass er genau das eben nicht ist, war in den 90 Minuten zuvor am Spielfeldrand deutlich zu erkennen. Der Coach schimpfte, brüllte, gestikulierte. Und als das Spiel abgepfiffen wurde, saß er für eine ganze Weile regungslos auf der Bank und starrte ins Leere.\nDas direkte Duell in Leverkusen hatte am Samstag die gegensätzliche Entwicklung beider Teams auf die Spitze getrieben. Ganze sechs Spieltage ist es her, dass die Eintracht scheinbar komfortable elf Punkte Vorsprung auf Bayer hatte. Doch während die Hessen seitdem nur drei Punkte ohne Sieg holten, waren es bei Leverkusen deren 16 ohne Niederlage.\nWodurch die Werkself nun tatsächlich schon an Frankfurt vorbeizog. Und Rang sechs eroberte, der am Saisonende zur Teilnahme an der Europa League berechtigen würde. Die die Eintracht im Vorjahr gewonnen hatte. Und die Bayer als letzter Bundesligaklub im Viertelfinale nun gewinnen will.\n„Es ist ärgerlich, das Ganze so verspielt zu haben“, sagte Kapitän Sebastian Rode. Er schöpfte ausgerechnet aus der eigenen Negativerfahrung Optimismus. „Wie oft hatten wir in den vergangenen Jahre gute Positionen einige Spieltage vor Schluss und haben es nicht über die Ziellinie gerettet?“, fragte er: „Jetzt gilt es zu hoffen, zu kämpfen und zu arbeiten, dass wir diesmal am Ende da stehen, wo wir stehen wollen.“\nAbgerechnet werde zum Schluss, sagte auch Sportvorstand Markus Krösche floskelnd. Er stellte gleichzeitig aber klar: „Wir werden jetzt keine Zielsetzung verändern.“ Die hieß zwar nie offiziell Champions League, das hatte Krösche zuletzt nochmal klargestellt. Aber sie hieß sehr wohl: Erreichen des internationalen Wettbewerbs. Und in dieser Hinsicht musste auch Krösche feststellen: „Es ist ein Rückschlag.“\nBeschwichtigend klang das Ganze auch bei Bayer, aber aus einer ganz anderen Blickrichtung. Dass nach sieben Pflichtspielen in Folge – einem eingestellten Vereinsrekord aus dem Jahr 2002 – plötzlich sogar die Champions League greifbar nahe ist, „hätte im Winter niemand gedacht“, wie Amine Adli erklärte. Der Franzose hatte das 1:0 erzielt. Moussa Diaby (34.), wie Adli nach Vorlage von Wirtz, sowie Sardar Azmoun per Konter (90.+5) nach dem Anschlusstreffer durch Djibril Sow (75.) trafen zum verdienten Sieg.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nFrankfurter Saisonendspurt\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWie die Eintracht die Crunchtime angeht\nFehler in deutscher Förderung\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDarum gehen im Fußball Talente verloren\nSpielerberater und Fußballklubs\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDas Geschäft mit den Kindern\n„Es ist super, dass wir mit dieser guten Dynamik weitermachen konnten“, sagte Trainer Xabi Alonso, der das Team nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten bestens im Griff hat und auch während des Spiels scheinbar immer die richtige taktische Maßnahme parat hat. „Aber wir schauen nicht auf die Tabelle.

Durch das 3:1 gegen  Eintracht Frankfurt steht die Werkself erstmals in der laufenden  Bundesliga-Saison auf Platz 6.\nEin Tor-Duo ebnete den Weg zum vielleicht wichtigsten Sieg der Saison. Die Franzosen Amine Adli (22) und Moussa Diaby (23) waren für Frankfurt nicht zu stoppen. Adli schoss das 1:0, Diaby legte das 2:0 nach – Leverkusen düst mit „Air France“ Richtung Europa, selbst die  Champions League ist keine Utopie mehr.\n\nFast über den halben Platz! Alonso feiert dieses Adli-Solo\nDer überragende Florian Wirtz (19) setzte Adli und Diaby immer wieder stark in Szene, er bereitete beide Tore vor. „Wir drei spielen im Angriff gut zusammen und helfen dem Team, wir können es aber noch verbessern. Wir hatten in der ersten Hälfte viele Chancen und hätten das Spiel früher entscheiden können. Ich bin sehr glücklich, mit solchen Spielen zusammenzuspielen, weil sie großes Talent haben und das Spiel für uns vereinfachen“, erklärt Adli.\nZum Comeback von Team-Kollege Wirtz sagt Adli: „Wir sind happy, dass er nach der schweren Verletzung wieder da ist.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nLässt Gegner schlecht aussehen und macht die Mitspieler besser: Leverkusens Teenager Florian Wirtz (Zweiter von rechts).\nDer 19-jährige Mittelfeldspieler treibt Leverkusen zu einem 3:1-Erfolg, von seiner Finesse profitiert die gesamte Mannschaft. Trainer Xabi Alonso blickt nun auf eine besondere Statistik - bei der Eintracht ist man arg angefasst.\nVon Milan Pavlovic, Leverkusen\nDie Ansage aus der Redaktion nach dem Pausenpfiff ist klar: eine Ode anstimmen auf Florian Wirtz. Nichts einfacher als das nach einer Vorstellung wie jener beim Spiel zwischen Bayer Leverkusen und Eintracht Frankfurt. Der gerade einmal 19-jährige Feinfuß servierte die beiden ersten Bayer-Tore an diesem gelungenen Nachmittag mit Leichtigkeit - und das in voller Bewegung und trotz der Bedrängnis durch büffelartige Gegenspieler, die wie so viele Gegner versuchten, Wirtz auf den Füßen zu\xa0stehen.\nDabei hätte Wirtz\' Arbeitstag auch schmerzvoll beginnen können. Schon nach neun Sekunden hatte Frankfurts Djibril Sow seine Stollen auf dem Schuh des Nationalspielers platziert. Der blieb einigermaßen unversehrt und fand danach immer neue Schlupflöcher, um sich den Gästen zu entziehen und seine Kollegen in Szene zu\xa0setzen.\nAuch beim mühsamen 1:0 im Breisgau fehlt es den Münchnern an Leichtigkeit. Nach dem Spiel provoziert Joshua Kimmich die gegnerischen Fans - eine Szene, die tief blicken lässt.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Sebastian Leisgang\nBeim 1:0 hatte er schon im Voraus geguckt, ob er Amine Adli mit einem Direktpass in die Gasse schicken könnte. Konnte er. Und so lief Adli ungebremst los - und versenkte den Ball angemessen sehenswert mit dem linken Außenrist knapp über Torwart Kevin Trapp zur Führung ins\xa0Netz.\nSchon nach zehn Minuten war in dieser unterhaltsamen Partie also klar, dass eine kuriose Rekordserie fortgesetzt würde: Zum 76. Mal fand das Duell Leverkusen gegen Frankfurt in der Bundesliga statt, zum 76. Mal würde es keine Nullnummer\xa0geben.\nSchnell, schneller, Diaby: Der französische Stürmer bejubelt sein Tor zum 2:0 - nach einem Pass von Florian Wirtz.\nDie Hauptattraktion blieb aber Wirtz: Der schmückte den Anlass mit einer zweiten Torvorlage. In der 34. Minute tippte er ein Anspiel etwa 30 Meter vor dem gegnerischen Tor kurz an, schaute einmal hoch, sah, wie der flinke Moussa Diaby in den Vollsprint-Modus schaltete und spielte ihm den Ball zwischen zwei Frankfurter Verteidiger in den Lauf - und zwar so, dass sein Mitspieler weder abbremsen noch beschleunigen musste. Der Rest - ein cool platzierter Abschluss ins entfernte Toreck - war pure Freude für den französischen Stürmer\xa0(34.).\nDanach war Wirtz mehrfach knapp dran am lupenreinen Assist-Hattrick, doch entweder verdaddelten seine Mitspieler gute Ideen. Oder Kevin Trapp lenkte einen kaum haltbaren Ball von Adli noch neben den Pfosten (43.). Was bei Wirtz ja gerne übersehen wird: Er schafft es mit seinem Spiel, auch den Kollegen Sicherheit zu geben. Gegen Frankfurt fielen vor allem die Verteidiger Edmond Tapsoba und Jonathan Tah auf, die sich erfolgreich auf den Frankfurter Stürmer Randal Kolo Muani konzentrierten. Auch Torschütze Adli und Stürmer Exequiel Palacios zeigten - inspiriert vom Wirtz-Wirbel - ihr\xa0Können.\nDass es nicht noch mehr nennenswerte Aspekte an Wirtz\' Darbietung gab, lag auch an ihm selbst. Denn wenn es darum ging, selbst zu treffen, wirkte er weniger zielstrebig, was Trapp in der 53. Minute eine weitere Parade ermöglichte. Dennoch sah es lange nach einen Osterspaziergang für den Werksklub aus - auch weil die Frankfurter die Kraft vermissen ließen, die sie in der vergangenen Saison international so furchteinflößend gemacht\xa0hatte.\nFrankfurt wirkte klar unterlegen, bis Bayer 04 die Eintracht einlud, sich vielleicht doch einen völlig unverdienten Punkt zu schnappen. Nach einem kollektiven Aussetzer der Gastgeber beim Anschlusstor durch Sow (74.) ging Leverkusen fast jede Souveränität flöten. Zumal Wirtz in der 77. Minute ausgewechselt wurde. Die Eintracht hatte zwar keine echte Chance mehr zum 2:2, aber das Chaos bei den Leverkusenern war beachtlich - es löste sich erst, als dem eingewechselten Azmoun nach einem Konter das erlösende 3:1 gelang\xa0(90.+5).\nBayer-Trainer Xabi Alonso stapelte danach tief, indem er sagte: ""Wir haben noch nichts geschafft."" Aber das stimmte nicht ganz, denn er hat damit aus seinen 19 Spielen als Coach nun 38 Punkte geholt, also einen glatten Zweier-Schnitt pro Partie - und das trotz anfänglicher Probleme (inklusive eines 1:5 im Hinspiel in\xa0Frankfurt).\nDas bedeutet auch, dass das Team des Spaniers die Frankfurter früher als gedacht von Platz sechs verdrängt hat - vor sechs Spieltagen hatte die Eintracht noch elf Punkte vor Bayer 04 gelegen. Darauf angesprochen, verfinsterte sich die Miene des zuletzt häufig schlecht gelaunten Frankfurter Trainers Oliver Glasner weiter. Dass Mario Götze mal wieder wegen Meckerns verwarnt wurde, weshalb er das nächste Spiel aussetzen muss, war das i-Tüpfelchen auf diesem Nachmittag. ""Sie wollen mich provozieren"", sagte Glasner zu einem Sky-Interviewer und beendete das Gespräch - so wie er bald darauf bei der Pressekonferenz seltsam angefasst reagierte und sagte: ""Ich lasse mich heute nicht provozieren. Ostern ist ein Friedensfest. Ich wünsche Euch allen frohe Ostern mit Euren\xa0Familien.""\nDer Abwehrspieler erlöst die Münchner mit einem Fernschuss, Sadio Mané und Serge Gnabry suchen verzweifelt das Glück - und Kimmich sorgt für eine Rudelbildung nach Schlusspfiff.

"{'content': 'Der FC Bayern hat durch den Sieg beim SC Freiburg mit etwas Mühe die Tabellenführung verteidigt. Die Münchner kamen bei ihrem Pokalschreck zu einem 1:0 (0:0).\nWährend SC-Trainer Christian Streich exakt auf die Startelf setzte, die am Dienstag beim überraschenden Pokalerfolg in München begonnen hatte, veränderte sein Kollege die Bayern-Mannschaft auf vier Positionen. Der gelb gesperrte Dayot Upamecano und der angeschlagene Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting standen Thomas Tuchel nicht zur Verfügung. Zudem verzichtete der Münchner Trainer im Vergleich zum Start im Pokal auf Kingsley Coman und Leon Goretzka. Dafür begannen Alphonso Davies, Serge Gnabry, Jamal Musiala und Sadio Mané. Es war eine sehr offensive Ausrichtung.\n„Ich glaube, die Bayern werden versuchen, uns arbeitslos zu machen im vorderen Bereich“, hatte Streich kurz vor dem Anpfiff gesagt. Doch ganz so arg kam es nicht, in der 44. Minute mussten die Münchner mit dem Pfostentreffer von Ritsu Doan sogar einen großen Schreck verkraften.\nDeren Trainer hatte sich ja mehr „Giftigkeit und Biss“ als beim Pokaldebakel gewünscht. Da hätte sein neues Team noch „Luft nach oben“, hatte Tuchel ausgemacht. Beim Wiedersehen mit den Freiburgern machten es die Bayern zwar besser, die Breisgauer aber stellten die gefährlichen Zonen recht gut zu und ließen so die Gäste nicht zu übermächtig werden.\nGegen den Distanzschuss von Matthijs de Ligt zum 1:0 aus rund 22 Metern ins rechte Eck (51.) aber waren dann alle machtlos, nicht zuletzt Freiburg-Torwart Mark Flekken. Dessen Team hatte dann durch Roland Sallai noch eine große Chance auf den Ausgleich (70.), die aber machte Bayerns Schlussmann Yann Sommer bravourös zunichte.\nAuf den Patzer beim FC Bayern, wo der BVB 2:4 unterlegen war, hat Borussia Dortmund einen Heimsieg folgen lassen: Der Tabellenzweite der Bundesliga bezwang Union Berlin 2:1 (1:0) und liegt zwei Punkte hinter den Münchnern.\nEs war das Duell zweier Mannschaften, die unter der Woche im DFB-Pokal verloren hatten. Am Dienstag war Union gegen Frankfurt ausgeschieden, tags darauf der BVB in Leipzig – jeweils 0:2. Am Samstag erwischte Union den besseren Beginn, ohne sich jedoch Chancen herauszuspielen. Im Anschluss an eine Schwalbe, für die Karim Adeyemi in der 17. Minute Gelb kassierte, wurde Dortmund druckvoller – und ging in der 28. Minute durch Donyell Malen in Führung. Er traf nach Vorarbeit von Raphaël Guerreiro, der mit nun elf Torvorlagen bester Vorbereiter in der Bundesliga ist.\nZu Beginn der zweiten Hälfte protestierten beide Fanlager mit Plakaten und Wechselgesängen gegen die Investorenpläne der DFL. Dann gelang Union durch Kevin Behrens auf Vorlage von Sheraldo Becker das 1:1 (62.). Der eingewechselte Youssoufa Moukoko erzielte nach einem Fehler von Paul Seguin das 2:1-Siegtor (79.).\nBayer Leverkusen ist das Team der Stunde in der Bundesliga. Die Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso gewann gegen Eintracht Frankfurt 3:1 (2:0) und feierte den fünften Sieg in Serie. Durch den Erfolg überholte Leverkusen den direkten Konkurrenten und nimmt die Champions League ins Visier.\nWieder einmal war Florian Wirtz, der maßgeblich am Aufschwung beteiligt ist, bester Leverkusener. Der Nationalspieler bereitete die Führung der Gastgeber vor. Er spielte einen Doppelpass mit Admine Adli, der den Ball in der zehnten Minute zum 1:0 unter die Latte schoss. Auch den zweiten Treffer legte Wirtz auf, Moussa Diaby nutzte seine perfekte Vorlage (34.).\nNach der Pause wachte Frankfurt auf, mehr als Djibril Sows Tor (74.) sprang aber nicht heraus. Sardar Azmoun beseitigte in der Nachspielzeit alle Zweifel am Sieg (90.+5).\nLange Zeit lebte die Partie zwischen Mainz 05 und Werder Bremen von der Hoffnung auf ein Tor. Dann wurde es beim 2:2 (0:0) plötzlich turbulent. Beide Mannschaften spielten in der ersten Hälfte mit viel Einsatz, aber ohne die nötige Konsequenz vor dem gegnerischen Tor. Ein Mainzer Treffer von Anton Stach zählte wegen Abseits nicht (51.).\nDann traf erst Ludovic Ajorque zum 1:0 für die Gastgeber (85.), ehe Jens Stage nur 81 Sekunden später für Werder ausglich. Nelson Weiper war für Mainz erfolgreich (90.+3), doch Niclas Füllkrug rettete Bremen doch noch den Punkt (90.+5).\nEine furiose erste Hälfte sahen die Zuschauer beim 3:1-Sieg (2:1) des 1. FC Köln in Augsburg. Der Erfolg verschaffte dem FC Luft im Abstiegskampf. Ellyes Skhiri traf früh für Köln (7.), musste aber noch rund zweieinhalb Minuten warten, bis der VAR sein sechstes Saisontor – alle in diesem Jahr erzielt – bestätigte. Kaum rollte der Ball wieder, legte Eric Martel nach (16.).\nUnd Augsburg? Die Gastgeber waren nur kurz geschockt und verkürzten durch Ruben Vargas (29.).

"{'content': 'Der FC Bayern hat sich beim SC Freiburg für das Pokal-Aus unter der Woche zumindest ein wenig revanchiert. Vier Tage nach dem Viertelfinal-K.o. gewann der deutsche Fußball-Rekordmeister sein Bundesliga-Auswärtsspiel in Freiburg mit 1:0 (0:0) und verteidigte seine Tabellenführung.\nBayerns Vorsprung auf Borussia Dortmund beträgt jedoch weiter nur zwei Punkte, weil der BVB gegen Verfolger Union Berlin mit 2:1 (1:0) gewann. Dortmund verhinderte mit etwas Mühe den dritten Rückschlag innerhalb einer Woche nach der Liga-Niederlage in München und dem Viertelfinal-Aus im DFB-Pokal bei RB Leipzig. Union als Dritter hat bereits fünf Zähler Rückstand auf den BVB. Neuer Vierter ist RB Leipzig nach einem 1:0 (1:0)-Erfolg bei Hertha BSC.Bayer Leverkusen setzte derweil seine Siegesserie beim 3:1 (2:0) gegen Eintracht Frankfurt fort und verdrängte die in der Bundesliga weiter schwächelnden Hessen vom sechsten Tabellenplatz. Der 1. FC Köln machte durch das 3:1 (2:1) beim FC Augsburg einen großen Schritt Richtung Klassenerhalt und tauschte in der Tabelle mit dem FCA die Plätze.

Auf der Gegenseite hatten sie Glück, als Ritsu Doan kurz vor dem Halbzeitpfiff den Pfosten traf. Nach dem Seitenwechsel versuchte es Matthijs de Ligt aus der Distanz, sein Traumtor sorgte für Bayerns Sieg (51.).\nDie Dortmunder waren von Beginn an um Wiedergutmachung bemüht.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 4 min\nEdin Terzic wusste, dass er Youssoufa Moukoko diesmal einfach mal Danke sagen musste: Der Stürmer schoss das 2:1 gegen Union Berlin.\nDer BVB hat alle Mühe mit Union, doch dann wechselt Trainer Terzic die richtigen Leute ein und das Team schafft es, an Bayern dranzubleiben. Köln befreit sich, in Mainz gibt es späte Aufregung. Alles Wichtige zum Spieltag.\nVon Felix Haselsteiner und Markus Schäflein\nBorussia Dortmund - Union Berlin 2:1 (1:0), Tore: 1:0 Donyell Malen (28.), 1:1 Kevin Behrens (61.), 2:1 Youssoufa Moukoko (79.)\nDas zweite Spitzenspiel des Spieltags entschieden die Einwechselspieler - auf beiden Seiten. Borussia Dortmund hatte sich in der ersten Hälfte anders als in der vergangenen Woche als sehr reife, konzentrierte Spitzenmannschaft präsentiert und war durch Malen in der 28. Minute verdient in Führung gegangen. Union arbeitete sich allerdings mit zunehmender Spieldauer zurück in die Partie und fand in der zweiten Halbzeit besser ins Spiel: Das 1:1 durch Behrens in der 61. Minute war durchaus\xa0verdient.\nDann jedoch folgten die Wechsel ins Unglück beziehungsweise ins Glück: Marco Reus hatte sich auf dem Weg Richtung Berliner Tor eigentlich schon verdribbelt, da kam Paul Seguin - kurz davor für den Torschützen Behrens eingewechselt - angelaufen, dessen zurückhaltende Klärung zur perfekten Vorlage wurde für den ebenfalls eingewechselten Youssoufa Moukoko. Dortmunds Stürmer umkurvte Frederik Rönnow, schob zum 2:1 ein und jubelte in den Armen von Edin Terzic, der genauso wie die 81\xa0000 Zuschauer erleichtert darüber wirkte, dass der Kampf um die Meisterschaft nach dem 27. Spieltag weiterhin komplett offen\xa0ist.\nBayer Leverkusen - Eintracht Frankfurt 3:1 (2:0), Tore: 1:0 Amine Adli (10.), 2:0 Moussa Diaby (35.), 2:1 Djibril Sow (75.), 3:1 Sardar Azmoun (90.+4.)\nAmine Adli besorgte das Leverkusener Premierentor gegen Frankfurt, danach traf auch Moussa Diaby.\nDer Saisonverlauf von Bayer Leverkusen gestaltet sich ziemlich parallel zum Saisonverlauf von Amine Adli. Zu Beginn der Hinrunde musste der Offensivspieler zusehen, nach einem Sehnenriss im Oberschenkel in der Endphase der vergangenen Saison gab der 22-jährige Franzose Mitte August beim 1:2 gegen Augsburg sein Comeback - und brach sich in der Partie umgehend das Schlüsselbein. Es folgte eine weitere Zwangspause von sechs Wochen. Nach dem Trainerwechsel zu Xabi Alonso fand Adli langsam, aber sicher zurück zu alter Stärke, und das kann man so von der ganzen Mannschaft\xa0behaupten.\nFünf Bundesliga-Spiele in Serie hat Bayer nun gewonnen - und Adli hat dabei zwei Treffer und drei Vorlagen beigesteuert. Am Samstag gegen Frankfurt trug er sich als Schütze zum 1:0 (10.) ein und war an der Entstehung des 2:0 durch Diaby (34.) beteiligt. Und die Frankfurter? Kamen noch zum 1:2 durch Sow (74.), aber ihre Bundesliga-Kurve verläuft genau entgegengesetzt zu der der Leverkusener, für die Azmoun noch einmal traf (90.+5). Folgerichtig ist die Eintracht nun in der Tabelle und im Kampf um die internationalen Plätze hinter Bayer\xa0zurückgefallen.\nFSV Mainz 05 - Werder Bremen 2:2 (0:0), Tore: 1:0 Ludovic Ajorque (85.), 1:1 Jens Stage (87.), 2:1 Nelson Weiper (90.+3), 2:2 Niclas Füllkrug (90.+4)\nDiesmal wieder ein rettendes Tor: Niclas Füllkrug erlebte mit Werder Bremen einen Nachmittag, an dem es erst spät richtig aufregend wurde. Er traf zum 2:2.\nDas Mainzer Publikum wusste, was es zu erwarten hatte: Aus den vergangenen sieben Spielen hatte der SV Werder lausige vier Zähler geholt, der FSV hatte in diesem Zeitraum 17 Punkte eingesackt, was den Ligabestwert darstellte. Aber die Leute gehen ja zum Fußball, weil sie nicht wissen, wie es ausgeht. Das wussten sie auch zur Halbzeit nicht, denn nach einer ersten Hälfte mit viel so genannter Intensität und ohne nennenswerte Torszenen war nichts von den zuletzt aufgezeichneten Formkurven zu erahnen. Als Anton Stach kurz nach der Pause dann doch für Mainz traf, stand er im\xa0Abseits.\nMit zunehmender Spieldauer wurden die Mainzer etwas druckvoller, Werder beschäftigte sich zunehmend mit Verteidigen. Das Publikum wusste wieder, was es zu erwarten hatte: Seit Ole Werner im November 2021 das Traineramt übernahm, hatte Werder noch kein einziges Mal 0:0 gespielt, warum also sollte es diesmal passieren. Und tatsächlich: Ajorque erzielte doch noch das 1:0 (85.), kaum war der Jubel verklungen, traf Stage per Kopf zum 1:1, dann schaffte Mainz noch das 2:1 durch den 18-jährigen Weiper, was wiederum die Formkurven zu bestätigen schien. Doch das war es immer noch nicht: Das letzte Wort hatte Bremen - Füllkrug besorgte schließlich das 2:2. Man weiß beim Fußball eben wirklich nicht, wie es\xa0ausgeht.\nFC Augsburg - 1. FC Köln 1:3 (1:2), Tore: 0:1 Ellyes Skhiri (7., nach Videobeweis), 0:2 Eric Martel (16.), 1:2 Ruben Vargas (29.), 1:3 Linton Maina (59.)\nDie frühe Führung für die Kölner in Augsburg: Ellyes Skhiri drückt den Ball zum 0:1 über die Linie.\nDer Anspruch des FC Augsburg an sich selbst ist es ja, sich in der Bundesliga so zu etablieren, dass die Beteiligten nicht mehr ständig das Wort Klassenerhalt in den Mund nehmen müssen. Schließlich spielt der FCA tatsächlich seit 2011 ununterbrochen im Oberhaus, da wird das bloße Drinbleiben langsam langweilig. Der Spielplan bot den Schwaben nun eine feine Gelegenheit, sich wirklich mal von der Abstiegszone abzusetzen - zuletzt waren sie mit vier Siegen und einem Remis in fünf Partien äußerst heimstark, und nun durften sie gegen die zuletzt so formschwachen Kölner ran, die in der Tabelle einen Punkt schlechter dastanden, bevor dann auch noch die restliche Kellerkonkurrenz gegeneinander antreten\xa0musste.\nDoch wie so oft ließen die Augsburger die Chance aus. Es ging ganz schnell: In der 7. Minute traf Skhiri zum 1:0 für Köln, der Videobeweis ergab: um Haaresbreite kein Abseits. Und nach einer guten Viertelstunde lief Martel nach einem schnell ausgeführten Einwurf ungestört aufs Tor zu und erhöhte. Vargas brachte die Augsburger zwar wieder heran (29.), aber auch im zweiten Durchgang kamen die Gäste zu den besseren Chancen - und nach einer knappen Stunde zum 3:1 durch Maina. Damit hat Köln Augsburg wieder überholt und muss das Wort Klassenerhalt vielleicht schon bald nicht mehr\xa0bemühen.\nDieser Spieltag könnte eine Art Vorentscheidung im Abstiegskampf bringen. Wieder stehen Traditionsklubs wie Schalke, Stuttgart oder Hertha BSC vor der Zweitklassigkeit - langfristig kann das ein Problem für die ganze Liga werden.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Auch dieses Spiel am Karsamstag hat keinen Ertrag gebracht. Wieder verloren, diesmal 1:3. Seit zehn Jahren geht das jetzt schon so für die Frankfurter Fußballprofis. Und auch der aktuelle Trainer Oliver Glasner hat es nicht geschafft, Leverkusen mit seiner Mannschaft entscheidend zu ärgern. „Das ist natürlich ein Rückschlag für uns“, sagte Markus Krösche. Der Sportvorstand der Eintracht meinte damit nicht nur das Abrutschen in der Tabelle von Platz sechs auf sieben. Er ärgerte sich auch darüber, dass es wieder einmal eine Verquickung individueller Fehler und Unzulänglichkeiten gewesen sei, die mit ausschlaggebend für den ernüchternden Nachmittag gewesen sei. Krösche sprach von einer „unnötigen Niederlage“ und äußerte in den Katakomben der Leverkusener Arena die Hoffnung, „dass wir diese Fehler abstellen“.\nZum dritten Mal nacheinander schon schenkte Glasner den selben elf Startspielern das Vertrauen. Die Hoffnung, nach Jahren voller Tristesse endlich etwas in Leverkusen zu erreichen, hatte nicht zuletzt durch den souveränen 2:0-Pokalerfolg gegen Union Berlin Auftrieb erhalten. Allein: Früh war erkennbar, dass für die Eintracht auch Ostern 2023 nichts zu holen sein würde. Diesmal dauerte es nur zehn Minuten, bis Bayer in Führung ging – und damit auch tabellarisch an den Frankfurtern vorbeizog. Schütze des verdienten Tores war der eifrige Amine Adli, der von einigen Fehlern in der Eintracht-Defensive profitierte. Erst hatte Aurelio Buta leichtfertig den Ball verloren, dann ließ es der zaudernde Evan Ndicka im Zweikampf an der letzten Konsequenz missen – und schon lag die Eintracht zurück.\n„Das ist bitter, dass wir so früh in Rückstand geraten“, sagte Glasner später in seiner kurzen Analyse. Die erste, einzige und nennenswerte Frankfurter Aktion im ersten Spielabschnitt war die Szene in der 13. Minute. Endlich einmal zirkulierte der Ball flott durch die Reihen. Sebastian Rode brachte auf der rechten Außenbahn Buta in Position. Dessen direkter Flankenball landete bei Philipp Max. Der Mann von der linken Außenbahn schoss sofort, doch Lukas Hradecky im Bayer-Tor war achtsam.\nKein Zweifel: Für die überlegenen Leverkusener schien Tor Nummer zwei im weiteren Verlauf nur eine Frage der Zeit zu sein. Nach einer knappen halben Stunde war es abermals Adli, dem sich nach einem Fehler des übereifrigen Kristijan Jakic eine weitere gute Einschussgelegenheit bot. In der 34. Minute war es dann soweit. Bayer erhöhte auf 2:0 – und eine neuerliche Niederlage der Eintracht in Leverkusen schien früh besiegelt. Schütze des zweiten Tores war Moussa Diaby: Ndicka fälschte dessen Schuss noch leicht ab. Weiteres Unheil drohte kurz vor der Pause, als Adli dem 3:0 sehr nah war. Doch Eintracht-Torwart Kevin Trapp verhinderte Schlimmeres. In der vorletzten Minute der dreiminütigen Nachspielzeit war die Gelegenheit für Bayer noch größer, Tor Nummer drei zu erzielen. Doch Adli traf den Ball aus drei Metern nicht richtig.\nIn der Vorbereitung auf die anspruchsvolle Auswärtspartie in Leverkusen hatte Eintracht-Trainer Glasner seinen Spielern nach dem Pokalerfolg einen freien Tag spendiert. Ziel: sich körperlich und mental zu erholen. Vom erhofften Frischefaktor war am Samstag zunächst kaum etwas zu sehen. Erst im zweiten Spielabschnitt zeigte die Frankfurter Mannschaft halbwegs ihr Gesicht.\nFrisch und unverbraucht war Ansgar Knauff, den Glasner in der zweiten Halbzeit für Buta in die Partie brachte. Der Dortmunder Leihspieler fügte sich sogleich mit einem Foulspiel ein, für das er verwarnt wurde. Auch Daichi Kamada bekam Einsatzzeit. Für ihn machte Rafael Borré in der 56. Minute Platz. Trotzdem waren es abermals die Rheinländer, die Kurs auf das Tor von Trapp nahmen, aber wieder scheiterte Diaby (56.). In der 64. Minute war Dienstschluss für Makoto Hasebe und Sebastian Rode. Tuta und Junior Dina Ebimbe sollten im Verbund mit den anderen Spielkameraden für das sorgen, was der Eintracht lange Zeit fehlte: Power, Schwung und Durchschlagskraft.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nAlle Infos und Themen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF.A.Z.-Sonderseite zu Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlle Teams im Überblick\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie aktuelle Tabelle der Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlles in der Übersicht\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpielplan der Bundesliga: Termine, Ergebnisse, Partien\nHoffnung kam auf, als Djibril Sow mit Übersicht und Feingefühl den Anschlusstreffer erzielte (74.). Es war zugleich das Startsignal, in der Schlussviertelstunde noch einmal alle Kräfte zu mobilisieren, um vielleicht doch noch den Ausgleich zu schaffen. Stattdessen aber waren es die Leverkusener, die am Ende der fünfminütigen Nachspielzeit eine weitere Kontersituation dazu nutzen, um für klare Verhältnisse zu sorgen. Als der Ball in Richtung Frankfurts Tor geschlagen wurde, unterlief Jakic ein kapitaler Fehler. Der Abwehrmann schätzte die Situation völlig falsch ein, denn anstatt zu köpfen, ließ er den Ball passieren. Eine willkommene Einladung für den eingewechselten Sardar Azmoun, alleine auf Trapp zuzulaufen, diesen zu umspielen und unbedrängt zum 3:1 für Bayer einzuschieben.\nWir haben viele Bälle viel zu einfach hergeschenkt“, klagte Rode später. Der Eintracht-Kapitän sprach ein Grundübel der Eintracht an diesem Samstag an: „Wir haben die entscheidenden Zweikämpfe verloren. Wir müssen einfach besser und konsequenter sein.“ Rodes Empfehlung für den Schlussspurt der Liga, in dem das Traumziel Europa nach dem 1:3 wieder etwas entrückt ist: „Es gilt, zu hoffen, zu kämpfen und zu arbeiten.“\nSein Trainer wollte überhaupt nicht in die Detailanalyse einsteigen. Dass er am kommenden Wochenende Ersatz für den in Leverkusen zum fünften Mal verwarnten Mario Götze finden muss, moderierte er lässig weg. Auch das Abrutschen auf Platz sieben interessierte ihn scheinbar nicht. „Ich schaue nicht auf die Tabelle. Ich schaue nur auf Borussia Mönchengladbach.“ Gladbach ist der nächste Heimspielgegner der Eintracht – und schon an diesem Sonntag gegen Wolfsburg gefordert. Sollte der VfL bei der Borussia gewinnen, würde auch er an der Eintracht im Klassement vorbeiziehen. Rechenspiele, von den Glasner nichts wissen wollte. „Wir haben jetzt Ostern.

"{'content': 'Es war wohl reiner Selbstschutz. Aber es mutete schon kurios an, wie leicht Oliver Glasner sich an diesem bitteren Samstag provoziert fühlte.\nAm Sky-Mikrofon missfiel dem Trainer von Eintracht Frankfurt nach dem 1:3 (0:2) bei Bayer Leverkusen die Frage über Ex-Weltmeister Mario Götze, der wegen Meckerns seine fünfte Gelbe Karte gesehen hatte. ""Sie wollen mich provozieren"", sagte der Österreicher. Auf Nachfrage antwortete er nur: ""Frohe Ostern."" Und ging.\nWenige Minuten später auf der Pressekonferenz unterbrach Glasner dann einen Journalisten, der ihm eine keineswegs provokante Frage nach der Handlungsschnelligkeit stellte. ""Ich lasse mich heute nicht provozieren. Das war schon vorher beim Interview so"", sagte er, nachdem er schon betont hatte, dass Ostern ein ""Friedensfest"" ist: ""Ich wünsche euch allen frohe Ostern. Feiert mit euren Familien."" Dann stand er auf.\nBegonnen hatte Glasner jenes Statement mit den Worten, er sei ""weiter ganz entspannt"". Dass er genau das eben nicht ist, war in den 90 Minuten zuvor am Spielfeldrand deutlich zu erkennen. Der Coach schimpfte, brüllte, gestikulierte. Und als das Spiel abgepfiffen wurde, saß er für eine ganze Weile regungslos auf der Bank und starrte ins Leere.\nRode beklagt fehlende Konstanz im Saisonendspurt\nDas direkte Duell in Leverkusen hatte am Samstag die gegensätzliche Entwicklung beider Teams auf die Spitze getrieben. Ganze sechs Spieltage ist es her, dass die Eintracht scheinbar komfortable elf Punkte Vorsprung auf Bayer hatte. Doch während die Hessen seitdem nur drei Zähler ohne Sieg holten, waren es bei Leverkusen deren 16 ohne Niederlage. Wodurch die Werkself nun tatsächlich schon an Frankfurt vorbeizog. Und Rang sechs eroberte, der am Saisonende zur Teilnahme an der Europa League berechtigen würde. Die die Eintracht im Vorjahr gewonnen hatte. Und die Bayer als letzter Bundesligist im Viertelfinale nun gewinnen will.\n""Es ist ärgerlich, das Ganze so verspielt zu haben"", sagte Kapitän Sebastian Rode. Er schöpfte ausgerechnet aus der eigenen Negativ-Erfahrung Optimismus. ""Wie oft hatten wir in den vergangenen Jahre gute Positionen einige Spieltage vor Schluss und haben es nicht über die Ziellinie gerettet?"", fragte er: ""Jetzt gilt es zu hoffen, zu kämpfen und zu arbeiten, dass wir diesmal am Ende da stehen, wo wir stehen wollen.""\nTrainer Alonso lobt ""Dynamik""\nAbgerechnet werde zum Schluss, sagte auch Sportvorstand Markus Krösche floskelnd. Er stellte gleichzeitig aber klar: ""Wir werden jetzt keine Zielsetzung verändern."" Die hieß zwar nie offiziell Champions League, das hatte Krösche zuletzt nochmal klargestellt. Aber sie hieß sehr wohl: Erreichen des internationalen Wettbewerbs. Und in dieser Hinsicht musste auch Krösche feststellen: ""Es ist ein Rückschlag.""\nBeschwichtigend klang das Ganze auch bei Bayer, aber aus einer ganz anderen Blickrichtung. Dass nach sieben Pflichtspielen in Folge - einem eingestellten Vereinsrekord aus dem Jahr 2002 - plötzlich sogar die Champions League greifbar nahe ist, ""hätte im Winter niemand gedacht"", wie Amine Adli erklärte. Der Franzose hatte das 1:0 erzielt. Moussa Diaby (34.), wie Adli nach Vorlage von Wirtz, sowie Sardar Azmoun per Konter (90.+5) nach dem Anschlusstreffer durch Djibril Sow (75.) sorgten für den verdienten Sieg.\n""Es ist super, dass wir mit dieser guten Dynamik weitermachen konnten"", sagte Trainer Xabi Alonso, der das Team nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten bestens im Griff hat und auch während des Spiels scheinbar immer die richtige taktische Maßnahme parat hat. ""Aber wir schauen nicht auf die Tabelle. Wir müssen ruhig bleiben."" Dann drehte er sich lächelnd zu Pressesprecherin Valeska Homburg um und fragte lächelnd: ""Wie sagt man auf Deutsch? Fuß auf dem Boden?""\nVergleichsportal\nGutscheine für Sport-Shops\n\n\n© G+J Medien GmbH\nZugang zu allen STERN PLUS-Inhalten und Artikeln aus dem Print-Magazin\nwerbefrei & jederzeit kündbar\nBereits registriert?'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Borussia Dortmund bleibt aber dank Rekordmann Youssoufa Moukoko dran. Leverkusen zieht an Frankfurt vorbei, Köln überrumpelt Augsburg.\nBorussia Dortmund - 1. FC Union Berlin 2:1 (1:0)\nBorussia Dortmund hat die jüngsten Rückschläge verdaut und mischt im Titelrennen der Fußball-Bundesliga weiter munter mit. Die Mannschaft von Trainer Edin Terzić besiegte den 1. FC Union Berlin im Verfolgerduell mit 2:1 (1:0) und liegt nur zwei Punkte hinter Spitzenreiter Bayern München zurück. Donyell Malen (28.) und der eingewechselte Youssoufa Moukoko (79.) sicherten dem BVB den achten Liga-Heimsieg in Serie. Union bleibt trotz der sechsten Saisonniederlage Tabellendritter. Kevin Behrens (61.) hatte zwischenzeitlich ausgeglichen.\nTerzić reagierte personell auf den desaströsen Auftritt beim Pokal-Aus in Leipzig (0:2). Jude Bellingham, Karim Adeyemi und Sébastien Haller rückten für Kapitän Marco Reus, Salih Özcan und den erkrankten Marius Wolf in die Startelf. Nach 20 Minuten übernahm der BVB gegen nun tief stehende Berliner das Kommando und suchte die Lücke im dichten Abwehrverbund der Gäste. Die erste Chance führte zur Führung. Malen entwischte nach einer Hereingabe von Raphael Guerreiro seinem Gegenspieler Niko Gießelmann und drückte den Ball aus kurzer Distanz über die Linie. Dortmund traf damit auch im 47. Liga-Heimspiel in Serie.\nSiegtor.\n(Foto: REUTERS)\nBeim BVB wuchs das Selbstvertrauen, auch in den Zweikämpfen waren die Schwarz-Gelben nun sehr präsent. Haller hatte die Führung zur Pause fast noch ausgebaut, der Stürmer scheiterte mit einem Kopfball aus kurzer Distanz aber an Torhüter Frederik Rönnow (43.). Nach dem Wechsel mangelte es der Begegnung zunächst weiter an Glanzpunkten - aus dem Nichts gelang den Eisernen aber der Ausgleich. Niklas Süle ging gegen Behrens zunächst nicht ins Kopfballduell. Nach Doppelpass mit Sheraldo Becker schob Behrens dann überlegt ein.\nEine Reaktion der Gastgeber blieb zunächst aus. Dem BVB mangelte es an Tempo, Präzision und Ideen. Den eigentlich auch harmlosen Berlinern bot sich sogar die Möglichkeit zur Führung. Doch Guerreiro rettete in höchster Not stark gegen Becker (71.). Terzic brachte für die Schlussphase Reus und Youngster Youssoufa Moukoko und Dortmund erhöhte noch einmal den Druck. Moukoko erreichte durch seine Einwechslung als jüngster Spieler auf die Marke von 50 Bundesligaspielen, er löste mit 18 Jahren und 139 Tagen Florian Wirtz von Bayer Leverkusen (18 Jahre und 226 Tage) ab.\nSC Freiburg - FC Bayern München 0:1 (0:0)\nPokal-Revanche geglückt, Tabellenführung untermauert, Selbstvertrauen für den Königsklassen-Kracher getankt: Rekordmeister Bayern München hat das Ende des Triple-Traums gut weggesteckt und durch das 1:0 (0:0) beim SC Freiburg alle seine Ziele für diesen 27. Spieltag erreicht. Matthijs de Ligt (51.) traf für die Bayern - vier Tage nach der Pleite gegen den SC im Viertelfinale des DFB-Pokals (1:2) und drei Tage vor dem Viertelfinal-Hinspiel in der Champions League beim englischen Meister Manchester City am Dienstag (21 Uhr/Prime Video und im Liveticker bei ntv.de). Die Freiburger mussten durch die erste Niederlage nach sieben ungeschlagenen Spielen und die erste Heimpleite nach zwölf Partien einen Rückschlag im Kampf um ihre erste Teilnahme an der Champions League hinnehmen.\nDer neue Bayern-Trainer Thomas Tuchel setzte im Breisgau auf Starpower. Der Nachfolger von Julian Nagelsmann bot Sadio Mané, Alphonso Davies, Jamal Musiala und Serge Gnabry auf - alle vier hatten bei der Pokal-Niederlage nicht in der Startelf gestanden. Verzichten musste Tuchel auf den gesperrten Abwehrchef Dayot Upamecano und den verletzten Stürmer Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. ""Wir kommen mit einer Niederlage im Gepäck und kennen die Tabellensituation"", sagte Tuchel kurz vor dem Anpfiff bei Sky: ""Es ist Druck drauf, wir sind im Endspurt in allen Wettbewerben. Wir wollen eine Antwort geben.""\nDie 34.700 Zuschauer im ausverkauften Freiburger Stadion sahen einen rasanten Auftakt. Im Anschluss übernahmen die Münchner zwar über weite Stecken das Kommando, Freiburg hielt aber gut dagegen und setzte auch in der Offensive Nadelstiche. In der 34. Minute verzog SC-Kapitän Christian Günter seinen Schuss am Ende eines vielversprechenden Konters. Kurz darauf musste Innenverteidiger Manuel Gulde angeschlagen raus, für ihn kam Philipp Lienhart (36.).\nGegen Ende der ersten Hälfte erhöhten die Bayern die Schlagzahl, die Führung der Münchner lag in der Luft. Ganz nah dran war aber der Japaner Ritsu Doan auf der Gegenseite, als er den Pfosten traf (44.). Zu Beginn des zweiten Durchgangs passierte erst einmal nicht viel - dann brachte Innenverteidiger de Ligt die Münchner fast aus dem Nichts mit einem sehenswerten Distanzschuss in Führung. Kurz darauf scheiterte Mane an Flekken (57.), die Möglichkeit von Leroy Sané war noch größer (60.) - durch die verpassten Chancen blieb der SC im Spiel. Das hätte sich in der 70. Minute fast gerächt. Torhüter Yann Sommer musste gegen den eingewechselten Roland Sallai in höchster Not retten. Sieben Minuten später konnte Sané erneut nicht den Deckel auf das Spiel machen.\nBayer Leverkusen - Eintracht Frankfurt 3:1 (2:0)\nBayer Leverkusen hat seine Aufholjagd fortgesetzt und auch das Verfolgerduell gegen Eintracht Frankfurt für sich entschieden. Auch dank des erneut überragenden Florian Wirtz siegte das Team von Trainer Xabi Alonso mit 3:1 (2:0) und zog vor dem Viertelfinal-Hinspiel in der Europa League gegen Union St. Gilloise am Donnerstag an der Eintracht vorbei auf Rang sechs.\nAmine Adli mit einem schönen Solo (10.) und Toptorjäger Moussa Diaby mit seinem neunten Saisontor (35.) sorgten schon vor der Pause für klare Verhältnisse - Nationalspieler Wirtz legte beide Treffer auf. Djibril Sow gelang das zwischenzeitliche Anschlusstor (75.), Sardar Azmoun (90.+4) sorgte für den Endstand. Leverkusen ist nun seit sechs Spielen in der Liga ungeschlagen, wettbewerbsübergreifend war es bereits der siebte Sieg in Serie für die Werkself. Der Europa-League-Sieger aus Frankfurt, der unter der Woche durch einen 2:0-Erfolg gegen Union Berlin das Halbfinale im DFB-Pokal erreicht hatte, wartet hingegen nunmehr seit sechs Liga-Spielen auf einen Sieg.\nLeverkusen obenauf.\n(Foto: IMAGO/Vitalii Kliuiev)\nDie Partie begann aggressiv. Eine Vielzahl an Fouls bestimmte die Anfangsphase, gleich nach zehn Sekunden langte Sow gegen Wirtz ordentlich hin. Dann bediente Wirtz am Mittelkreis Adli. Der flinke Stürmer legte sich den Ball zweimal weit vor, ließ die beiden Eintracht-Verteidiger Evan Ndicka und Kristijan Jakic ins Leere laufen und schob locker an Torwart Kevin Trapp vorbei. Die Leverkusener, die zuletzt 2013 ein Heimspiel gegen die SGE verloren hatten, blieben das gefährlichere Team und nutzte jeden Stellungsfehler in der Frankfurter Defensive. Moussa Diaby hätte nach Vorlage von Wirtz nur noch einschieben müssen, rutschte aber weg (25.).\nWirtz zeigte sich wie schon in der Vorwoche beim 3:0 auf Schalke als absoluter Aktivposten, war praktisch überall als Ballverteiler zu finden. Diaby verwertete schließlich einen Steilpass des 19-Jährigen zur verdienten Pausenführung. Frankfurt konnte sich bei Torhüter Kevin Trapp bedanken, der mehrfach einen höheren Rückstand verhinderte. Nach der Pause übernahm die Eintracht etwas mehr die Spielkontrolle. Leverkusen verwaltete und lauerte über seine schnellen Offensivspieler auf Konter. Wirtz (53.) und Diaby (56.) verpassten es, frühzeitig für die Entscheidung zu sorgen.\n1. FSV Mainz 05 - SV Werder Bremen 2:2 (0:0)\nDer FSV Mainz 05 hat im Rennen um die internationalen Plätze einen kleinen Dämpfer hinnehmen müssen. Die in der Rückrunde bislang so formstarke Mannschaft von Trainer Bo Svensson kam im Heimspiel gegen Aufsteiger Werder Bremen trotz Überlegenheit nach einer höchst turbulenten Schlussphase über ein 2:2 (0:0) nicht hinaus, baute ihre eindrucksvolle Erfolgsserie aber immerhin auf acht Spiele ohne Niederlage aus.\nInsgesamt dürfen sich die Mainzer trotz zwei verspielter Führungen durch Ludovic Ajorque (85.) und Nelson Weiper (90.+3) weiter Hoffnungen auf die erstmalige Teilnahme an einem europäischen Wettbewerb seit sieben Jahren machen. Werder wartet dagegen trotz seiner Treffer von Jens Stage (87.) und Nationalspieler Niclas Füllkrug (90.+4) seit fünf Partien auf einen Erfolg, der Befreiungsschlag blieb trotz eines engagierten Auftritts aus. Die Sorge, dass das Team von Trainer Ole Werner doch noch in den Abstiegsstrudel geraten könnte, bleibt.\nNiclas Füllkrug erzielte mit seinem 16. Saisontor den Ausgleich in letzter Minute.\n(Foto: dpa)\nDie Mainzer haben in der bisherigen Rückrunde bereits ihre Punkteausbeute der gesamten Hinserie erreicht, gegen Bremen wirkte das Spiel des FSV aber deutlich ideenloser. Svenssons Team entwickelte zwar mehr Zug zum Tor, der letzte Pass lief jedoch oftmals ins Leere. An die jüngsten Heimauftritte konnte Mainz zunächst nicht anknüpfen. Direkt nach der Pause jubelten die Gastgeber zwar - aber zu früh. Ajorque hatte für den ersten gefährlichen FSV-Abschluss gesorgt, beim Treffer im Nachsetzen stand Anton Stach jedoch im Abseits (51.). Viele Zweikämpfe, intensive Duelle, aber auch zahlreiche Abspielfehler prägten das Bild.\nGenerell agierten die Rheinhessen deutlich schwungvoller. Dominik Kohr (61.) und erneut Ajorque (61.) kamen per Kopf zu weiteren Chancen, auch Edimilson Fernandes (72.) prüfte Werder-Keeper Jiri Pavlenka. Füllkrug (73.) sorgte auf der Gegenseite vor den Treffern in den Schlussminuten für einen der seltenen gefährlichen Werder-Momente. Dann entschädigte die Schlussphase für 84 torlose Minuten.\nFC Augsburg - 1. FC Köln 1:3 (1:2)\nDank eines Blitzstarts, mit etwas Glück und großer Entschlossenheit hat der 1. FC Köln seine Ergebniskrise beendet. Mit zwei Treffern in den ersten 16 Minuten legte die Mannschaft von Trainer Steffen Baumgart in einem über weite Strecken munteren Schlagabtausch den Grundstein zu einem 3:1 (2:1) beim FC Augsburg. Es war der erste Sieg nach einer Serie von sechs Spielen mit nur zwei Punkten und einem Treffer.\nEllyes Skhiri brachte die bissigen und zielstrebigen Kölner in Führung (7., nach Videobeweis), Eric Martel erhöhte kurz darauf (16.). Nach dem Augsburger Anschlusstreffer durch Ruben Vargas (29.) wackelte die Abwehr der Gäste teilweise sehr bedenklich. Linton Maine (59.) beruhigte danach die Nerven gegen weiter energisch angreifende Augsburger, die erstmals in diesem Jahr ein Heimspiel verloren.\nWenige Minuten nach der Anerkennung der Führung legten die Kölner in der sehr temporeichen und von vielen Zweikämpfen geprägten Begegnung schon nach. Beim Schuss von Martel aus spitzem Winkel sah der unsichere Augsburgs Torhüter Rafal Gikiewicz allerdings nicht gut aus: Der Ball ging ihm durch die Beine.\nDer scheinbar beruhigende Vorsprung gab der Geißbock-Elf keine Sicherheit, weil Augsburg mit Leidenschaft nach vorne drängte und so Fehler in der Kölner Defensive provozierte. Nach einer Ecke und einem Abpraller brachte Vargas die Gastgeber heran, danach lag mehrfach der Ausgleich in der Luft - der Pausenpfiff kam dem FC gerade recht.\nIn der zweiten Halbzeit stand Köln etwas sicherer, Augsburg verlor dadurch etwas von seiner Wucht. Als guter Griff von Baumgart erwies sich die Hereinnahme von Dejan Ljubicic: Der Österreicher sorgte für Stabilität im Mittelfeld und Schwung über die rechte Seite, zudem legte er dem quirligen Maina mit einer perfekt getimten Vorlage den dritten Treffer seiner Mannschaft auf.\nQuelle: ntv.de, tsi/sid'}",Moussa Diaby,de

Unterdessen trafen sich Axel Hellmann und Philip Holzer zu einem weiteren Gespräch.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtn-b74dr\nRandal Kolo Muani ist in aller Munde. Die 19 Pflichtspieltreffer in 37 Spielen und zwölf Torvorlagen des Eintracht-Stürmers in dieser Saison sprechen für sich: Momentan ist der 24 Jahre alte französische Nationalspieler, der zum 2:0-Heimerfolg über Union Berlin im DFB-Pokal beide Treffer beisteuerte, wohl der beste Angreifer in Deutschland. Kein Wunder, dass Europas Topvereine auf den kometenhaft durchgestarteten Liganeuling Kolo Muani aufmerksam geworden sind.\nNun sollen sich auch die Bayern mit ihrem neuen Trainer Thomas Tuchel mit einem Transfer des angriffslustigen Ausnahmekönners beschäftigen. Der hebt trotz seiner steilen Karriere nicht ab, wie auch sein mit einem Balljungen geteilter Torjubel nach dem 2:0 gegen Berlin in der WM-Arena bewies. „Ich habe gesehen, dass sich der Junge gefreut hat – genauso ex\xadtrem wie ich mich selbst“, sagte Kolo Muani.\nGrund zur Begeisterung boten auch dessen Torerfolg und Torvorlage beim 5:1 in der Hinrunde im Duell mit Bayer Leverkusen. Vor dem zweiten Aufeinandertreffen an diesem Samstag (15.30 Uhr im F.A.Z.-Liveticker zur Bundesliga und bei Sky) in Leverkusen gab Kolo Muani im Bewusstsein eigener Stärke Schwächen preis. Er glaube, dass Bayer-Profi Moussa Diaby „ein bisschen schneller“ sei. „Weil er etwas kleiner ist, kommt er auch leichter vom Fleck“, sagte Kolo Muani und grinste. Diaby ist ein „guter Freund“ des Stürmerstars aus Paris.\nKolo Muanis Frankfurter Mannschaftskollege Rafael Borré besticht als Vielläufer in der Offensive. Aber so viel beachtet wie der Franzose ist der kolumbianische Nationalspieler bei weitem nicht. Das liegt daran, dass ihm Kolo Muani in dieser Runde mit Abstand den Rang abgelaufen hat. Und auf den Halbpositionen gab es für Borré kein Vorbeikommen an Mario Götze und Jesper Lindström, der über mehr Tempo als Borré verfügt und dadurch mehr in die Tiefe geht.\nDer gefeierte Europa-League-Held der Vorsaison musste sich daher oft mit der Rolle des Einwechselspielers begnügen, was vor allen dessen Beratern missfallen haben soll. Erst als sich der Däne Lindström am Knöchel verletzte, war Borré Mitte März wieder erste Wahl. In den Erstliga-Begegnungen gegen Stuttgart (1:1), Union Berlin (0:2) und Bochum zählte er jeweils zur Startformation. Nur sein dritter Saisontreffer wollte ihm partout nicht gelingen – trotz ausgezeichneter Möglichkeiten.\nDoch mal hatte sich wie gegen Bochum ein Gegenspieler auf der Torlinie postiert und bereinigte für sein Team die Situation, oder Borré traf mit seinem Schuss nur die Latte. Auf dem Weg zum von ihm herbeigesehnten Torerfolg scheint der Südamerikaner vom Pech verfolgt zu sein. Oliver Glasner hält dennoch aus Überzeugung an ihm fest, weil er Borrés Beharrlichkeit und Kämpferherz schätzt.\n„Wir stehen zu hundert Prozent hinter Rafael“, sagte der Trainer zwei Tage vor dem Spiel bei Bayer 04. „Wer so viel Fleiß und Herzblut für das Team gibt wie Rafael, der wird immer unsere vollste Unterstützung erhalten.“ Glasner verwies auf den Ballgewinn von Borré vor dem 2:0 im Pokal gegen Union. Dadurch sei „alles andere ins Rollen“ gekommen, so der Trainer. „Es wird immer der Torschütze gefeiert, aber es ist meistens ein Produkt der Mannschaftsleistung.“\nBorré ärgere sich selbst am meisten „über vergebene Chancen oder ähnliche Situationen“, teilte der Fußballlehrer mit, bei dem Teamplayer, die sich für das große Ganze aufopfern, hoch angesehen sind. Besser machte es Borré zuletzt bei der Nationalmannschaft: Im Testspiel gegen Japan (2:1) brillierte er mit einem spektakulären Fallrückzieher. In Frankfurt dürfte sich Borré, der jetzt deutlich weniger Bälle verliert als noch vor ein paar Wochen, weiter von Beginn an in den Dienst der Mannschaft stellen, ließ Glasner jüngst doch wissen, dass Lind\xadström auch „in den kommenden zwei, drei Wochen“ kein Thema sein werde.\nFür Glasner ist Borré im Kreis der Offensivspieler „der beste Spieler gegen den Ball“. Einer, der zudem die Wertschätzung seiner Mitspieler besitzt. Der Kolumbianer sei „wieder sehr wichtig für uns“, sagte Kapitän Sebastian Rode. „Und wenn Rafael so weitermacht, trifft er auch wieder.“ Von der kommenden Saison an soll Omar Marmoush zu den Eintracht-Torschützen gehören, der Wolfsburger Angreifer steht vor einem Wechsel nach Frankfurt. Eintracht-Sportvorstand Markus Krösche hatte den 24-Jährigen unlängst als „interessanten Spieler“ bezeichnet.\nUnterdessen hatten sich Vorstandssprecher Axel Hellmann und der Aufsichtsratsvorsitzende Philip Holzer am Mittwoch zu einem weiteren Gespräch getroffen. An dem „in guter und konstruktiver Atmosphäre stattgefundenen Austausch“, wie es in einer Pressemitteilung hieß, nahmen auch Vereinspräsident Peter Fischer sowie die Aufsichtsratsmitglieder Stephen Orenstein und Claudio Montanini teil. „In dem knapp vierstündigen Gespräch wurden ausführlich die aktuellen Themen, insbesondere die Lösung möglicher Interessenkonflikte im Hinblick auf eine Kapitalaufnahme durch die Eintracht Frankfurt Fußball AG besprochen.“\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nEintracht Frankfurt\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t„In Leverkusen ist es für uns brutal schwer“\nEintracht im Pokal-Halbfinale\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKolo Muani ist der Stürmer mit den Superlativen\n2:0 im DFB-Pokal\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie Eintracht siegt dank Kolos Klasse\nAlle Anwesenden hätten „bekräftigt, ohne Einschränkungen hinter der aktuellen Unternehmensbewertung zu stehen“, war der Vereinsmitteilung weiter zu entnehmen.

"{'content': 'Ediciones:\nFutbol/champions-league\nAnalizamos, números en mano, a las duplas más potentes de Europa. Elegir la mejor es cosa tuya\nErling Haaland y Kevin de Bruyne evidenciaron su gran entendimiento, por enésima vez esta temporada, en la goleada sobre el Arsenal (4-1). El Manchester City presume de contar con la \'pareja de moda\' en Europa. Su \'sociedad ilimitada\' ha lanzado a los de Guardiola a por el triplete, pero hay otras duplas que aspiran a conquistar esa \'corona\'. En MARCA las ponemos todas sobre la mesa. ¿Y tú de quién eres?\nMucho se ha hablado de la (tirante) relación entre Messi y Mbappé. Más aún después de que Francia ganara a Argentina en la final del Mundial. ""Hay mucho respeto entre ellos. Tienen una actitud ejemplar después de los partidos"", destacó Galtier.\nSobre el \'verde\', sin embargo, se entienden de maravilla. Kylian y Leo son la pareja, dentro de las cinco grandes Ligas, que más goles ha \'fabricado\' en común: 13. No es una sociedad, todo hay que decirlo, muy equitativa. Messi le ha \'regalado\' 10 goles a Mbappé mientras que Kylian \'sólo\' le ha dado tres a Leo.\nEl binomio del City \'atemoriza\' a Europa. Haaland y De Bruyne han puesto la directa hacia el triplete (Liga, Copa y Champions) y tienen el cruce de semis contra el Madrid en la \'mirilla\'.""Tienen una conexión especial y se nota. Cuando Kevin tiene el balón, Erling sabe que puede correr y el balón le llegará"", remarca Guardiola.\nSu entendimiento se traduce en números. El noruego y el belga han producido 10 goles de forma conjunta en Premier. Lo normal es ver a \'KDB\' asistiendo a Haaland. Así ha sucedido hasta en ocho ocasiones. Ante el Arsenal, sin embargo, se cambiaron los papeles. Fue Erling quien le dio dos pases de gol a \'Tintín\'. ""De Bruyne es el mejor centrocampista del mundo. Su sociedad con Haaland ha elevado su juego a una nueva dimensión"", apunta Kolo Touré.\nNadie contaba con ellos... pero el georgiano y el nigeriano están a punto de guiar al Nápoles a su primer \'Scudetto\' 33 años después de Maradona.""Con \'Kvara\' sentí empatía desde el primer momento. Es muy bueno, pero también es un buen chico. Eso también importa"", señala \'Super-mhen\'.\nOsimhen (21) y Kvaratskhelia (10) lideran, respectivamente, la carrera por los títulos de \'Capocannonieri\' y máximo asistente de la Serie A. Entre ambos han producido ocho goles. Seis han \'nacido\' de asistencias del georgiano y dos de pases del nigeriano.\nXabi Alonso cuenta con la banda derecha más \'eléctrica\' de Europa. Su ubicación sobre la \'pizarra\' es curiosa. A menudo el carrilero/lateral (Frimpong) ocupa posiciones medias más adelantadas que el teórico mediapunta/extremo (Diaby). El excanterano del PSG tiene querencia a meterse hacia el medio y eso libera la banda para el neerlandés.\nTienen algo en común. Son dos de los jugadores más rápidos de la Bundesliga. Ambos figuran en el \'top 10\'. Diaby ocupa la tercera posición con una velocidad punta de 36,52 km/h y Frimpong es quinto, con 36 km/h. Su registro de asistencias está, más o menos, equilibrado: cinco de Diaby a Frimpong y tres en el sentido opuesto.\nUna sociedad que no vive su mejor momento. Y es que Mourinho ha retirado a Abraham su condición de titular indiscutible. Belotti le está \'arañando\' minutos en las últimas semanas al ex del Chelsea.\nDybala, en cambio, sigue a su \'bola\'. La \'Joya\' está completando un temporadón: sus 16 goles y ocho asistencias entre todas las competiciones han guiado a la Roma a las semis de la Europa League y a pelear por la Champions \'vía Serie A\'. Ambos, en cualquier caso, \'casan\' bien. Dybala le ha dado tres goles a Abraham y el inglés le ha \'servido tres tantos en bandeja\' al argentino.\nEl argentino y el brasileño han reeditado esporádicamente en París el gran entendimiento que exhibieron en Barcelona. Lo han hecho, eso sí, a \'cuentagotas\', cuando las interminables lesiones de \'Ney\' se lo han permitido. ""No hemos podido jugar juntos todos los partidos, pero creo que el vínculo que hemos ido creando es muy bueno, puesto que la relación entre nosotros es maravillosa"", advertía Neymar en la \'CNN\'.\nLos ex del Barcelona han forjado seis dianas conjuntamente esta temporada en Ligue 1. Messi le ha dado el doble de goles a Neymar (4) que el brasileño al argentino (2). Veremos si vuelven a jugar juntos... en París.\nBuena parte del liderato del Arsenal en Premier se ha cimentado, en gran medida, sobre la producción anotadora de sus extremos. Especialmente en ausencia del lesionado Gabriel Jesus. ""Es una pesadilla jugar contra Martinelli. Es una amenaza constante"", asegura Mikel Arteta. Más de lo mismo sucede con Saka.\nLa balanza de su relación está un tanto desequilibrada. Cinco de los seis goles que han \'producido\' en común han salido de las botas de Saka. El Arsenal necesitará la mejor versión de ambos para poder pelearle la Premier al City hasta el final.\nLa \'simbiosis\' de \'El dúo de la oscuridad\', como se apodan, está fuera de toda duda. Karim y Vini han fabricado 41 goles en común desde que el brasileño recaló en el Real Madrid en 2018.\nEn LaLiga 2022-23, sin embargo, no han evidenciado ese entendimiento. Apenas han conectado en cuatro goles, tres llevan la firma de Benzema y uno de Vinicius. Fuera de LaLiga sí que han mostrado su sinergia. Entre Champions, Copa, Mundial de Clubes y Supercopa de Europa se han \'inventado\' 10 goles. Vini (7) es, generalmente, el que hace las veces de asistente. Benzema le ha servido en bandeja tres dianas.\nEl Barcelona va lanzado a ganar LaLiga, pero ha echado mucho de menos al lesionado Dembélé en el tramo final de la temporada. Lewandowski, por su parte, lidera la lucha por el \'pichichi\' con 18 dianas sin haber completado un curso extraordinario. No le ha hecho falta tampoco.\n""Dembélé es el jugador que más me ha sorprendido del Barça"", reconoce el polaco, que ha notado como sus cifras se resentían en ausencia del extremo francés y de Pedri. En total comparten cuatro goles en común en el marco de LaLiga. Dembélé ha asistido en dos tantos a Lewandowski, los mismos que le ha dado \'Lewy\' a Ousmane.\nGriezmann se ha erigido, especialmente tras el Mundial, en el \'MVP\' del Atlético y en uno de los mejores jugadores de LaLiga. El ex de la Real Sociedad y Barcelona está muy por encima, a nivel de rendimiento, del resto de sus compañeros.\nSi nos ceñimos a las estadísticas, su mejor socio es Álvaro Morata. Es con el que más goles (4) ha producido en común. Tres dianas le ha dado Griezmann a Morata. En el sentido contrario sólo ha llegado una. ""Antoine es fundamental para nosotros dentro y fuera del campo"", admite Álvaro.\nPenaldu\nValverde y Yabusele, los más temibles\nLot87\nMuy buenos Vinicius y Benzema, y normal la avalancha de amor madridista en este diario, pero porqué es tan difícil opinar con objetividad ?\n© Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

La Union Saint-Gilloise acababa de marcar el 1-3 que permitía a su diversa afición seguir soñando con seguir en la competición europea tras un empate en el partido de ida. Pero el cuarto de los de Xabi Alonso puso fin a ese sueño para el club centenario, que se coló en la competición de la UEFA tras ganar la liga regular el año anterior recién ascendido desde la segunda división.\nEl fútbol durante la Guerra Civil: por qué el Levante UD ha ganado la Copa de la República de 1937\nPero esta no es una crónica deportiva sino la historia de cómo un equipo de barrio belga ha metido un sprint en los últimos años que le ha permitido plantar cara a los grandes del país y medirse con otros clubes importantes de Europa con un presupuesto mucho menor.\nLos orígenes del Union Saint-Gilloise son humildes. Lo fundaron en 1897 un grupo de amigos en la comuna belga de Saint-Gilles, que fue a mediados del siglo pasado el barrio por antonomasia que acogió a los emigrantes españoles e italianos que buscaban en el norte del continente un futuro mejor. El comienzo de la andadura del equipo fue meteórica con el ascenso a primera división en la temporada 1900-1901.\nSu camino ha estado plagado de altibajos y, tras una bajada en su rendimiento en las siguientes décadas, en los primeros años de los 30 fue campeón tres veces y no conoció la derrota en 60 partidos consecutivos. Sin embargo, la Segunda Guerra Mundial marcó un antes y un después. Mientras que los clubes de su alrededor se profesionalizaron, el Union-Saint Gilloise se quedó atrás. La travesía en el desierto ha durado prácticamente 80 años, con excepciones como la disputa de la semifinal de la extinta Copa de Ferias 58-60. En aquella ocasión, el sueño europeo se truncó ante el Birmingham.\nEl punto de inflexión definitivo llegó en 2018 de la mano de Tony Bloom, un jugador de póker profesional que sumó el club a sus activos, entre ellos el Brighton & Hove Albion de la Premier League. Después de 48 años, el Saint-Gilloise volvió a la primera división en 2021 y alcanzó un nuevo récord al ganar la liga regular belga frente a equipos con presupuestos muy superiores. Fue así como se coló en la competición europea.\nYou can be proud, guys. 👏 pic.twitter.com/i9YwSzMeQ0\n“El Union SG no ha dejado de dar la campanada esta temporada en la Europa League, y lo ha vuelto a hacer al plantar cara al Leverkusen y arrancarle un meritorio empate en Alemania. Por lo general, al conjunto belga no le ha resultado difícil marcar, ya que ha anotado dos o más goles en seis de sus ocho últimos partidos en esta competición. Con el apoyo de su público, los hombres de Karel Geraerts confían en seguir haciendo historia y mantener vivo el sueño de pasar a semifinales”, resumía la UEFA antes del partido de vuelta disputado el jueves.\nEl azul y el amarillo inundaron las calles que rodean el Lotto Park, el estadio del Royal Sporting Club Anderlecht, el rival que tuvo que cederle el campo para los partidos de la competición europea. Y es que, las condiciones del Joseph Marien, donde La Roja jugó en las olimpiadas de 1920, no cumple los estándares de la UEFA, que impone que todos los asistentes tengan asiento en las gradas.\nLos bares de la zona acogieron, además, a los aficionados desde horas antes del enfrentamiento. La música acompañaba la fiesta regada con cerveza Jupiler, que es la que patrocina la liga belga, y seguidores de distintas edades –muchos jóvenes– aguardaban en ordenadas filas para comprar perritos calientes, hamburguesas y patatas fritas. El club también hizo su agosto con la venta de merchandising de un encuentro histórico.\nLa afición del Saint-Gilloise también ha cambiado. Ya no la integran solo los emigrantes económicos de la mitad del siglo XX sino que ha acogido a un perfil hipster que ahora vive en Saint Gilles y a representantes de la denominada burbuja de Bruselas que se han animado a seguir a un equipo que tiene su propia cerveza, la 1897.

El equipo de Piero Hincapié tuvo un marcador global de 1-3 ante el Union Saint Gillon de Bélgica.\nA pesar de que el marcador y el desempeño en casa no habían sido los esperados por la escuadra de Xabi Alonso, el empate previo de 1-1 dejaba la serie abierta. Los belgas esperaban dar las sorpresa y sacar la victoria que se les escapo agónicamente en el duelo previo.\xa0Con Piero Hincapié como titular, el elenco farmacéutico se lanzó en busca de la victoria como visitante. El ponerse al frente en el marcador no le costó demasiado y encaminó desde un inicio el triunfo.\nEl Leverkusen no esperó demasiado para ponerse en ventaja y, antes de que se cumplan dos minutos de partido, cayó el primer gol. Moussa Diaby apareció y demostró sus condiciones como delantero al encarar al golero rival.\xa0La escuadra alemana gestaba su primer ataque y Florian Wirtz se lanzó hacia las parcelas contrarias. En su carrera protegió bien la pelota, dejó dos rivales atrás y se asoció bien con Diaby, quien devolvió de primera.\xa0Aunque parecía que la pelota se iba a escapar del dominio teutón después de que quedó dividida, un pase en profundidad logró encontrar al delantero francés. Este se internó en el área y eludió al guardameta.

"{'content': 'Este jueves concluyeron las series de cuartos de final de la UEFA Europa League 2022-23 y, en consecuencia, ya se conocen los cuatro clasificados a semifinales: Juventus, que eliminó a Sporting de Lisboa; Sevilla, que dejó en el camino a Manchester United; Bayer Leverkusen, que venció a Union Saint Gilloise; y Roma, que hizo lo propio ante Feyenoord. El único equipo español en carrera pero a la vez el más ganador del certamen deberá jugar ante la Vecchia Signora de Matías Soulé, Ángel Di María y Matías Soulé; mientras que en el otro duelo se enfrentarán el conjunto en el que milita Paulo Dybala contra el de Exequiel Palacios.\nEl máximo ganador de la historia de la competencia fue demasiado para un elenco inglés dormido que no logró hacer pie en el estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán en ningún momento. El resultado global terminó 5 a 2 luego de un 2 a 2 en Inglaterra (goles de Marcel Sabitzer para los Diablos Rojos y de Harry Maguire y Tyrell Malacia en contra para los Nervionenses) y un contundente 3 a 0 para el equipo local en España (dos tantos de Youssef En-Nesyri y uno de Loic Badé). Así, el conjunto dirigido por José Luis Mendilibar aspirará a meterse en su séptima final de Europa League con una particularidad: ganó las seis que disputó.\nPor otro lado, a la Vecchia Signora le alcanzó un empate 1 a 1 en el Allianz Stadium (anotaciones de Adrien Rabiot para el elenco italiano y de Marcus Edwards para el combinado portugués) para sentenciar la serie 2 a 1 ante el conjunto portugués luego del 1 a 0 como visitante en el encuentro de ida (gol de Frederico Gatti). De esta manera, los dirigidos por Massimiliano Allegri buscan su cuarto título luego de los conseguidos en las temporadas 1976-77, 1989-90 y 1992-93.\nBayer Leverkusen se deshizo con facilidad de Union Saint Gilloise de Bélgica luego de un 5-2 en el global. En el partido de ida disputado en el estadio BayArena de Alemania, igualaron 1 a 1 con tantos de Florian Wirtz para el local y de Victor Boniface para el visitante. En el duelo de vuelta, el equipo dirigido por Xabi Alonso se hizo fuerte de visitante y ganó 4 a 1 con tantos de Jeremie Frimpong, Mitchel Bakker, Moussa Diaby y Adam Hlozek (Casper Terho descontó para los belgas). Busca la segunda copa (levantó el trofeo en la edición de 1987-88).\nEl último equipo en clasificarse a semifinales fue la Loba, que necesitó del tiempo suplementario para eliminar a la única institución de Países Bajos que quedaba en competencia. La serie finalizó 4 a 2 para los dirigidos por José Mourinho, que sueña con levantar su segundo título continental consecutivo (en la última temporada ganó la Conference League). Paulo Dybala convirtió un gol agónico a los 89′ y le dio a su equipo la posibilidad de disputar el tiempo extra, donde fue mucho más que su rival y lo derrotó 4 a 1.\n🤯 𝙎𝙀𝙈𝙄𝙁𝙄𝙉𝘼𝙇𝙄𝙎𝙏𝘼𝙎 🤯🧡❤ @ASRomaEspanol⚫️🔴 @bayer04_es ⚪⚫ @juventusfces🤍❤ @SevillaFC#UEL pic.twitter.com/d4PpNm3Sdw\nLos partidos de ida de cada una de las series se disputarán el 11 de mayo, mientras que los de vuelta se jugarán el 18.

"{'content': 'De esta forma, el Sevilla se medirá ante la Juventus, mientras que la Roma se enfrentará al Bayer Leverkusen por las semifinales de la Europa League.\nEl Sevilla FC venció (3-0) este jueves al Manchester United en la vuelta de cuartos de final de la Liga Europa celebrada en un eufórico y lleno Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán, un paso más en la leyenda del seis veces campeón de la competición, que se medirá por un puesto en su séptima final con la Juventus.\nEl cuadro español se comió al inglés con el ambiente en Nervión y con la puesta en escena de juego, compromiso y gol. Un error de Maguire propició el 1-0 de En Nesyri a los ocho minutos mientras que Badé dobló la renta al poco de la reanudación, en un remate con el hombro que tocó el larguero y se coló en la red de David de Gea. El meta español regaló también el tercero al marroquí, superados los ingleses desde el aviso que les dejó Old Trafford.\nEl United, con hasta cinco bajas en su habitual once, fue engullido por la mística continental de un Sevilla que hace suya esta Liga Europa, como en el tramo final en Mánchester para hacer un 2-2 de la nada. José Luis Mendilibar, en el banquillo andaluz desde hace un mes, ha dado las armas para resucitar a un equipo que muerde arriba, aprovecha sus ocasiones y es fuerte atrás.\nEl cuadro local, espoleado por el ambiente de las grandes noches, lanzó la presión y recogió sus frutos ante Maguire. El internacional inglés se vio rodeado y En Nesyri aprovechó el mano a mano con De Gea (1-0). El equipo de Ten Hag tardó 20 minutos en volver en sí, con buenas carreras de Antony y pocas de Sancho para paliar la ausencia de un cerebro como Bruno Fernandez, pero sin remate.\nPese a la lesión de Marcao, el Sevilla supo mandar y defenderse cuando tocó, para llegar a hacer el 2-0 antes del descanso. El duelo se volvió, con ese tanto de Ocampos que fue anulado por milímetros, en un ida y vuelta que volvió a encender al Pizjuán. El equipo de ‘Mendi’ tenía la sartén por el mango y lució pegada a los dos minutos de la segunda parte con el remate de Badé.\nEn un saque de esquina de un Rakitic mariscal durante todo el encuentro, el defensor francés firmó un remate parabólico con el hombro que hizo enloquecer al Pizjuán (2-0). Ten Hag había metido ya al ‘tocado’ Rashford tras el paso por vestuarios, pero la empresa inglesa se antojaba imposible por juego y sensaciones.\n‘Mendi’ quería más control, pero el corazón iba por su cuenta en un Sevilla que no dejó de apretar y buscar el tercero. Weghorst fue la otra opción de Ten Hag, pero los locales eclipsaron a un United con mucha menos fe. La defensa ‘red devil’ la sacó en boca de gol, Navas frenó a Rashford y, en otro arreón, llegó el 3-0 de En Nesyri tras un grave error de De Gea a 10 minutos del final.\nLa Juventus, otro grande que tendrá que pasar por el Pizjuán, se puede dar por avisada. El Sevilla, en un año de penurias, no renuncia a su leyenda. El efecto Mendilibar se ve en competición doméstica, saliendo finalmente de la zona baja, y en la Liga Europa recupera el club su mejor versión, favorito a un séptimo título.\n\nCrédito: SportsCenter\nEl Sporting de Portugal y el Juventus de Turín empataron este jueves (1-1) en Lisboa en el partido de vuelta de los cuartos de la Liga Europa de fútbol, por lo que el triunfo por 1-0 en la ida garantizó a la “Vecchia Signora” el pase a la siguiente ronda de la competición.\nDespués de que el Oporto y el Benfica cayeran a manos del Inter de Milán en la Liga de Campeones y de que el Braga fuera eliminado por el Fiorentina en la Liga de Conferencia, ahora le tocó al Sporting caer ante un cauteloso Juventus, que sufrió para eliminar a los portugueses.\nEn Lisboa, el partido se decantó mayoritariamente hacia los locales, con momentos de intensa presión, pero sin hacer mella en los de Massimiano Allegri, bien organizados defensivamente y sin duda felices tras haber recuperado temporalmente los 15 puntos que les fueron retirados en la Serie A.\nLos “leones”, alentados por la mayor afluencia de público a su estadio esta temporada, arrancaron bien el partido, pero no tardó en caer un balde de agua helada sobre la capital portuguesa gracias al gol del Juventus en el minuto 9.\nTras un córner, el titubeo de los defensas del Sporting creó una oportunidad para que Rabiot marcara el tanto inicial del partido y aumentara el grado de dificultad para los lusos.\nEl gol del francés permitió a Massimiliano Allegri poner a su Juve a hacer lo que mejor sabe, bajar sus líneas para conservar la ventaja, pero la rapidez del inglés Marcus Edwards obligó al experimentado técnico a replantearse su estrategia.\nEn un momento del partido en el que el Sporting presionaba más, Edwards corrió por la banda derecha de forma supersónica y asistió a Trincão, que envió el balón al poste.\nLa jugada continuó con el uruguayo Manuel Ugarte, una de las grandes figuras de la primera parte, que al llegar al rechace fue placado por Rabiot en el área, lo que llevó a Edwards, aún a mil por hora, al punto de penalti, desde donde empató a los 20.\nLa “Vechia Signora”, acampada en su campo, realizó pocas visitas a la portería defendida por el madrileño Antonio Adán, pero las que efectuó causaron cierto peligro, debido a alguna desconexión defensiva del equipo verdiblanco.\nEl mayor quebradero de cabeza para los turineses fue Ugarte, omnipresente en el campo y una auténtica pesadilla para Chiesa o Di María, al igual que el japonés Morita, que repitió su brillante actuación en Italia.\nPero fue en una pérdida de Morita cuando el Juventus estuvo cerca del segundo, que no llegó porque el centro de Juan Cuadrado fue demasiado rápido y raso para que Vlahovic, solo ante la portería, lo rematase bien.\nComo en el partido de ida, el Sporting tuvo algunos problemas de definición. A ello no ayudó un muro juventino compuesto por dos viejos conocidos, los brasileños Alex Sandro y Danilo, que vistieron la camiseta del Oporto durante muchos años.\nA medida que el cronómetro avanzaba, el Juventus recurrió a las lecciones más arraigadas del “Calcio” para estar con un pie en semifinales, aunque no con la misma cohesión de antaño.\nUn ejemplo de ello fue la distracción de Danilo, que dejó al lateral Esgaio solo delante de Szczesny y con el empate en sus pies, pero éste disparó demasiado fuerte.\nMientras los turineses echaron mano de su experiencia, los lisboetas fueron a por todas e incluso Sebastián Coates se sumó al ataque.\nEl veterano central uruguayo fue el que más cerca estuvo del gol en los últimos instantes -y en todo el partido-, y sus fallos sumieron en la desesperación a los aficionados verdiblancos.\nEl Sporting se despidió de la Europa League con la sensación de que podía haber hecho más, después de que dos errores en los dos partidos le pasaran factura.\nA su vez, el pragmatismo y la experiencia del Juventus le bastaron para seguir en la competición y para poder dar un vuelco a su inusual temporada.\nCrédito: ESPN\nPaulo Dybala resucitó este jueves al Roma con un tanto fundamental en los últimos compases que alargó el partido hasta la prórroga, en la que guió a los suyos a la victoria ante el Feyenoord (4-1, 4-2 global) y a las semifinales de la Liga Europa de fútbol, en las que se medirá al Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nPaulo Dybala volvió a ser la pieza clave del Roma. No hay mucho más misterio en la noche europea del jueves en la capital italiana. El Roma parecía muerto, desahuciado con el tanto de Paixao, pero revivió de la mano de un Dybala que, a medio gas, tocado todavía de la lesión que sufrió en la ida, volvió a conducir al éxito a los de Mourinho.\nSufrió el conjunto ‘giallorroso’ sin su estrella en la primera mitad. El Roma empezó motivado, intenso, acompañado por un Estadio Olímpico lleno, incluida la parte visitante por la prohibición de entrada a los aficionados neerlandeses, que intimidó en los primeros instantes, pero falto de lucidez en los metros finales. La que pone siempre Dybala.\nY es que muy consciente de la importante baja de su rival, el Feyenoord en defensa fue un cerrojo. Juntó la línea de defensa y la del centro del campo y complicó sobremanera el tránsito por el carril central, obligando a los de Mourinho a lanzar el largo constantemente, un remedio que apenas surtió efecto.\nSolo la calidad de Spinazzola por la izquierda generaba espacios que luego el propio carrilero desestimaba con centros desacertados. Matic exhibió su calidad en acciones defensivas todo el partido, imperial minimizando al máximo los ataques rivales.\nEl efecto estadio fue desapareciendo a medida que el Feyenoord fue asentándose. Un disparo de Cristante que rozó el palo, una contra mal gestionada entre Belotti y Pellegrini y un disparo de El Shaarawy fueron lo más destacado en ataque de una ‘Loba’ que, además de verse incapaz en metros finales, sufrió la lesión de Wijnaldum.\nA todo esto, el Feyenoord llevó el partido a su terreno. Pérdidas de tiempo desde el minuto 1, faltas para cortar el ritmo y tanganas para sacar de quicio a los italianos surtieron el efecto deseado. No se jugaba con regularidad.\nLos neerlandeses fueron creciendo paulatinamente basándose en esa solidez defensiva y a raíz de la ocasión más clara del partido. Una gran combinación en el centro del campo que acabó con un centro que remató potente Szymanski directo a puerta, justo al sitio en el que estaba un Rui Patricio que se encontró el balón y lo desechó a bocajarro.\nEl segundo acto comenzó igual que el primero, con un arreón de los locales que desembocó en remate al palo de Pellegrini. El estadio empezó a creer y tras una respuesta neerlandesa, llegó el ansiado gol romanista. Spinazzola, clave en el éxito de este equipo, remachó un balón suelto e incendió, más todavía, el partido.\nLas piernas de los jugadores del Feyenoord empezaron a temblar. Las de los del Roma volvieron a estar frescas. El conjunto de Róterdam empezó a desconfiar, a tener dudas de la que había sido hasta el momento una salida de balón perfecta que derivó en una imprecisa. El gol lo cambió todo.\nLa entrada de Dybala fue un plus añadido que volcó el choque aún más hacia la meta defendida por Bijlow. Incluso Cristante puso el 2-0 en el marcador, pero el colegiado anuló el tanto por una falta previa clara de Abraham.\nPero lo que parecía ir en una dirección cambió radicalemente con la lesión de Smalling, líder absoluto de la zaga ‘giallorossa’. Sin él, el Roma fue más débil atrás. Y el Feyenoord sacó el máximo rédito posible cuando estaba contra las cuerdas. Paixao remató libre de marca y anotó el empate a uno. Se hizo el silencio en el Olímpico.\nEl problema del Feyenoord fue el mismo que el otros tantos equipos que pasan por la capital italiana. Tiene nombre y apellidos. Es Paulo Dybala. La ‘Joya’ no falla en los momentos grandes desde su llegada a Roma. Un buen control dentro del área le bastó para hacer sangre, para reenganchar a la afición y para llevar el partido a la prórroga.\nPasó de todo en el tiempo suplementario. La tuvo el Feyenoord clarísima en botas de Giménez. Dybala asustó con una recaída, visiblemente molesto, pero se recuperó para poner un córner a la cabeza de Ibáñez que acabó en la madera. El partido se rompió ante el desgaste físico, y entre idas y venidas llegó la sentencia. Pellegrini encontró a Abraham en el área y el ariete hizo lo propio con El Shaarawy.\nPero no se quedó ahí el encuentro. Otra vez Dybala fue la fórmula de la felicidad. Pase de oro a Abraham que el ariete estrella en el meta pero cuyo rechace recogió Pellegrini para poner el 4-1 definitivo con suspense por la revisión del VAR.\nEl Roma es Dybala y diez más. El campeón del mundo llevó a los suyos a las semifinales, en las que se medirá al Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nCrédito: ESPN\nUn arranque contundente ante un rival inexperto condicionado por la presión facilitó la victoria en Bruselas (1-4) del Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso, que se situó en las semifinales de la Liga Europa y acabó con el equipo revelación del Viejo Continente, que, cuando recuperó el desparpajo y quiso reaccionar, ya tenía la clasificación muy cuesta arriba.\nEl Union St. Gilloise belga ha sido la sensación de la Liga Europa. Sin bagaje en este tipo de competición estuvo a un paso de situarse entre los cuatro mejores del torneo. Afrontó la cita como local con un buen marcador obtenido en el choque de ida, empate a un tanto que complicaba la tarea del Leverkusen.\nPero el equipo germano impuso su ley desde el principio. Refuerza a Xabi Alonso la situación del Bayer. Cuando el preparador español llegó al BayArena el equipo estaba en descenso en la Bundesliga y con un pie fuera de la Liga de Campeones. Ahora, meses después, el cuadro de Leverkusen está en la parte alta de la clasificación alemana y es aspirante al título de la Liga Europa, a la que llegó como tercero de su grupo en la ‘Champions’ y dejó fuera al Atlético Madrid.\nEl conjunto de Xabi ya lleva doce partidos sin perder. Empezó a fraguar la victoria a los dos minutos, en una acción que nació en una conducción de Florian Witz que terminó con un balón dividido entre Adam Hlozek y el defensa Senne Lynen que acabó en los pies de Moussa Diaby, que superó al meta Anthony Moris.\nEl equipo de Karel Geraerts ni siquiera había asimilado la situación y Jeremie Frimpong pudo hacer el segundo a los veinte minutos. Pero llegó a siete del descanso, en una transición que inició Diaby, que centró al checo Adam Hlozek y culminó el neerlandés Mitchel Bakker.\nTras el descanso el encuentro se desató. Marcó el tercero que sentenció el choque Jeremie Frimpong, vivo ante el error garrafal del portero Moris ante la presión de Bakker.\nFue entonces, con todo perdido, cuando despertó el St. Gilloise. Acortó distancias enseguida, cinco minutos después, en el 65, en una estupenda jugada por la izquierda, robo incluido, de Loic Lapoussin que terminó con un centro al área que recogió el finlandés Casper Terho, que amagó, tiró y marcó.\nDespués pudo hacer el segundo Victor Boniface de cabeza y a continuación Simon Adingra tiró a un palo. Pudieron ser el segundo y el St. Gilloise, a la desesperada, reengancharse al duelo. Pero fue al contrario.\nA diez minutos del cierre un tiro de Diaby que rechazó el portero Anthony Moris fue recogido y aprovechado por el checo Adam Hlozek, que hizo el cuarto, hundió del todo al representante de Bélgica y llevó a semifinales al Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso.\nAvenida Italia 850, Providencia, Santiago. \n+56 9 6919 6517 info@elmostrador.cl'}",Moussa Diaby,es

"{'content': ""LALIGA SANTANDER\nBarça - Osasuna, en directo\nAlmería - Elche, en directo\nAsí marcó Florian Wirtz el gol del empate para el Bayer Leverkusen\nIMma Mentruit\nEl Bayer Leverkusen de Xabi Alonso no pudo ir más allá del 1-1 en la ida de los cuartos de final de la Europa League ante el Union Saint-Gilloise y tendrá que decidir su pase a semifinales en casa del conjunto belga, la gran revelación de la presente edición del torneo. Y ello a pesar de que el equipo alemán pudo marcar el segundo tanto en el tramo final del encuentro del BayArena.\nFlorian Wirtz protagonizó la primera ocasión del partido, pero la joya del Leverkusen disparó desviado. Por el Union Saint-Gilloise, la primera llegó por mediación de\xa0Yorbe Vertessen tras un doble regate. Victor Boniface creó también peligro ante un Leverkusen que no acababa de sentirse cómodo ante el equipo belga. Moussa Diaby pudo también marcar, tras una jugada de Adli, al final de la primera mitad, pero le faltó puntería.\nSe mostraba una vez más el Union Saint-Gilloise como un equipo muy fiable y competitivo, dispuesto a continuar ampliando la gesta que está logrando en la presente Europa League. Y en efecto logró avanzarse en el marcador del BayArena. Lo hizo gracias a Boniface, con el interior del pie derecho y tras una jugada de Teddy Teuma. Era el minuto 51.\nObligado a darle la vuelta al partido, el Bayer Leverkusen se hizo con el control y dispuso de ocasiones para al menos nivelar el encuentro, pero fueron transcurriendo los minutos sin que el equipo de Xabi Alonso se encontrara con el gol. Frimpong fue protagonista de una de las acciones que el conjunto alemán no pudo aprovechar.\nHasta que en el 82' marcó Wirtz, en un tanto en el que fue clave Sardar Azmoun con su trabajo para distraer a los defensas del Union Saint-Gilloise. La entrada de Azmoun, su lucha, tras entrar en el 67' para sustituir a Adli, resultó clave para el Bayer Leverkusen.

Encontrará más información en nuestras Políticas de privacidad.\nEn su primera temporada como entrenador de un equipo de primera división, Xabi Alonso convence e intimida, está en la pelea por los puestos europeos y ya detenta una marca histórica en el Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nXabi Alonso dirige el Bayer Leverkusen contra el Bayern Múnich.\n""A él solo le gusta ganar partidos. Lo principal es que ganemos”, dice el ofensivo del Bayer Leverkusen Amine Adli acerca de lo que su D.T., Xabi Alonso, transmite a los muchachos en cada entrenamiento. El balance del español de cara al cierre de la presente temporada es a todas luces digno de quitarse el sombrero.\nA la (corta) distancia, el tiempo parece darle la razón al director deportivo de los ""aspirinos”, Simon Rolfes, en su decisión de traer a un poco experimentado Alonso a tomar las riendas de un equipo de las exigencias del Leverkusen. Pero lo del campeón del mundo en 2010 ya es histórico a nivel\xa0club en su primera temporada como director técnico de un equipo de primera división.\nCuando se anunció el relevo de Gerardo Seoane en la dirección técnica del Bayer Leverkusen en octubre pasado, el equipo navegaba sin rumbo en la posición 17 de la tabla general al margen de la jornada ocho. Dos descalabros en tres partidos de Champions League, y el aplastante 4:0 ante el Bayern Múnich en dicha jornada, fueron motivos suficientes para la destitución del suizo en la todavía joven campaña 2022/23. Dicho sea de paso, Alonso no pudo salvar al equipo de la eliminación en Champions.\nTranscurridas 27 fechas, los farmacéuticos contemplan los puestos europeos como una realidad palpable de la mano de Xabi Alonso, artífice de un asombroso repunte que hoy los coloca en la sexta posición de un campeonato en su franja crepuscular a siete jornadas del final. Asimismo, el equipo sigue en la pelea por la Europa League en instancias de cuartos de final.\nCampeón del mundo (2010), doblemente campeón de Europa (2008 y 2012), ganador de Champions League con el Liverpool (2005) y el Real Madrid (2014), y tres veces monarca de Bundesliga con el Bayern Múnich (2015-2017), son los mayúsculos títulos que describen por sí mismos la carrera de Xabi como futbolista, considerado uno de los mejores mediocampistas defensivos de este deporte. Como director técnico, no obstante, nada de esto es certificado de garantía al frente de un equipo.\nY si bien durante su carrera futbolística respondió a las órdenes de sendos mentores (Carlo Ancelotti, José\xa0Mourinho y Pep Guardiola), Alonso ya da muestras de eso que llaman ""tener madera” para dirigir: ningún otro entrenador de Bundesliga en la historia del Bayer Leverkusen tiene un porcentaje de victorias tan alto como el del español (63 %) tras lograr 12 victorias en 19 partidos; las últimas cinco de manera consecutiva. Así, el voto de confianza de la directiva para el exentrenador del segundo equipo de la Real Sociedad va por buen camino.\nFlorian Wirtz (izq.) y Xabi Alonso.\nLas palabras de Armine Adli que enmarcan el inicio de este relato dan cuenta del clima interno por el que atraviesa el equipo de Alonso, quien ha logrado volver a articular el empuje ofensivo del Leverkusen con artistas ofensivos como Jeremy Frimpong, Moussa Diaby, el propio Adli y Florian Wirtz.

"{'content': ""After kicking off ESPN's college football Future Power Rankings with quarterbacks, the series switches to the other side of the ball with the defenses.\nGeorgia and other recent national champions will appear below, but so will several teams that have yet to reach the College Football Playoff and might struggle to ever take that leap. Iowa, for example, has become a mainstay on this list because of a historically opportunistic defense (offsetting a historically inept offense), but the Hawkeyes' best CFP finish was No. 5 in 2015. Programs such as Utah, NC State and San Diego State have risen in their respective conferences because of their strength on defense.\nSome elite defenses have shown impressive staying power despite change. Georgia and Michigan both finished in the top seven in fewest points allowed last season, after going through significant changes both with personnel and coaches. Other units rose in 2022, such as Illinois and Troy, and now must maintain the trajectory without some key players.\nThe biggest challenge here was assessing the lost production for perennial top defenses and how much, if at all, they will fall off.\nAs a reminder, these rankings cover the top 25 defenses during the next three seasons -- 2023, 2024 and 2025 -- and examine both current rosters and future recruiting. Coaching and consistency also factor into which teams make the cut.\nHere's a look at last year's Future Power Rankings for defense. Now, for the latest rundown.\n\n2022 future defense power ranking: 2\nScouting the Bulldogs: One of the major curiosities entering last season was how Georgia's defense would fare after losing a record five NFL first-round draft picks, several other notable players and coordinator Dan Lanning. The 2022 unit wasn't quite as dominant but barely dropped off in helping the team to its second straight national title. The Bulldogs led the nation in rushing defense, ranked second in third-down efficiency and fifth in points allowed. They don't lose as much star power this season, although Jalen Carter is irreplaceable in the middle of the line, and standouts such as linebacker Nolan Smith and defensive backs Christopher Smith and Kelee Ringo also exit Athens. Georgia looks loaded at positions such as inside linebacker and safety. Smael Mondon and Jamon Dumas-Johnson combined for 146 tackles, including 17 for loss (four sacks by Dumas-Johnson). Free safety Malaki Starks and star Javon Bullard help anchor a secondary that also brings back starting cornerback Kamari Lassiter.\nCarter leaves a massive void, but Georgia's overall line depth is strong with 2022 sacks leader Mykel Williams as well as veterans Nazir Stackhouse, Tramel Walthour and Warren Brinson. There's some turnover at outside linebacker, but sophomore Chaz Chambliss is expected to emerge alongside second-year Jalon Walker, who also has worked inside. Georgia also has overtaken Clemson as the nation's premier defensive recruiting operation. The team's six highest-rated recruits for 2023 play defense, headlined by linebacker Raylen Wilson (ESPN's No. 15 overall recruit) and safety Joenel Aguero (ESPN's No. 27 overall). Georgia also has commitments from four 2024 defensive recruits ranked in ESPN's top 50 nationally, led by cornerback Ellis Robinson IV (No. 5 overall).\n2022 future defense power ranking: 1\nScouting the Tigers: Despite a step back last fall, Clemson projects well through 2025. Coordinator Wes Goodwin is no longer new, but the unit loses several mainstays, including linemen Myles Murphy, Bryan Bresee and K.J. Henry, and linebacker Trenton Simpson. But Clemson retained more production than some expected, as linemen Tyler Davis, Xavier Thomas and Ruke Orhorhoro are all back for their fifth or sixth seasons. Davis is a three-time All-ACC selection who earned All-America honors in 2022, while Thomas and Orhorhoro both have earned third-team All-ACC honors. Senior end Justin Mascoll is another veteran presence. The key is building for 2024 and 2025 with junior tackles Payton Page and Tre Williams, among others. Clemson adds Peter Woods, ESPN's top defensive tackle and No. 4 overall recruit for the 2023 class, as well as four other ESPN 300 line recruits.\nLinebacker also looks strong with Jeremiah Trotter Jr., a second-team AP All-America selection, leading the group alongside Barrett Carter, who earned first-team All-ACC honors. The two combined for 12 sacks and 24 tackles for loss in 2022. Sophomore Wade Woodaz emerged last season and will take on an even bigger role, especially in 2024. Clemson will look to second-year players T.J. Dudley and Kobe McCloud to provide more depth. Injuries hit Clemson's secondary hard in 2022, but there were some bright spots, such as safety Jalyn Phillips, who returns for his final year, and cornerbacks Sheridan Jones and Nate Wiggins. Toriano Pride Jr. and Jeadyn Lukus, both sophomores, help the cornerback outlook beyond 2023. Safety Andrew Mukuba, the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2021, will try to rebound from a disappointing season. Clemson has nice depth at safety with senior R.J. Mickens. The team also has two ESPN 300 recruits committed for 2024.\n2022 future defense power rankings: 10\nScouting the Wolverines: After a surprise breakthrough in 2021, the entire Michigan program showed it had staying power last fall, but especially the defense. The unit lost NFL first-round draft picks Aidan Hutchinson and Daxton Hill and second-round pick David Ojabo, as well as coordinator Mike Macdonald. But Michigan once again finished in the top 10 in many categories, and it transitioned well from Macdonald to Jesse Minter, a Broyles Award finalist who is back. Key returning players include safety Rod Moore, lineman Kris Jenkins, linebackers Junior Colson and Michael Barrett, and cornerback Will Johnson, who blossomed late in his freshman year and will play at least two more seasons. Defensive lineman Mason Graham is another key returnee who will play at least through 2024. Sophomore cornerback Amorion Walker drew strong reviews during spring practice and adds to a playmaking secondary that features Moore, Johnson, senior nickel Mike Sainristil, senior safety Makari Paige and others.\nDefensive end will be one of the most interesting positions to watch, as Michigan clearly needs a pass-rushing boost the next few years. Jaylen Harrell showed promise in 2022 with 3.5 sacks and a team-high five quarterback hurries. Michigan is hopeful senior Braiden McGregor, a top-35 recruit in 2020, finally breaks through. But there are other options, such as Derrick Moore, a decorated 2022 recruit who had two sacks last season, or Coastal Carolina transfer Josaiah Stewart. Michigan added several key transfers on defense, including linebacker Ernest Hausmann, who had 54 tackles and started seven games as a true freshman at Nebraska last fall. The Wolverines' recruiting is on the upswing, as the team signed lineman Enow Etta and two other ESPN 300 defenders for 2023, and have three committed for 2024.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 4\nScouting the Tide: Some might be surprised to see the Tide not drop in these rankings, given the angst around their defense at times last season and the departures of star pass-rusher Will Anderson Jr., safety Brian Branch, coordinator Pete Golding and others. But Alabama has a chance to reestablish its dominance on defense, thanks to exceptional recruiting in 2023 and the return of veteran playcaller Kevin Steele to Tuscaloosa. Plus, the Tide actually held up well last season, finishing ninth nationally in points allowed and 12th in yards allowed. Let's start with who returns: Alabama has several proven standouts in junior cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstry (team-high 15 pass breakups in 2022) and linebacker Dallas Turner, who has 12.5 sacks and 18 tackles for loss the past two seasons. If Turner recaptures his 2021 form and boosts the pass rush along with others, including senior Chris Braswell, Alabama should be in good shape for the short term.\nThe defensive line projects as an area of strength, although Anderson's production will be missed. The Tide return experience with seniors Justin Eboigbe and Tim Smith, and promising young players such as sophomore Jaheim Oatis and juniors Jamil Burroughs and Kendrick Blackshire. Linebacker also should be solid with Turner, Braswell, redshirt sophomore Deontae Lawson and others. McKinstry, senior star/nickel Malachi Moore and versatile sophomore Terrion Arnold provide a nice foundation in the secondary. Alabama will need others to emerge for short-term depth, but the 2024 and 2025 outlook is excellent. The team signed ESPN's top-rated outside linebacker (Jaquavious Russaw), safety (Caleb Downs) and defensive end (Keon Keeley) in the 2023 recruiting class, along with the No. 2 cornerback (Desmond Ricks). Cornerback Jaylen Mbakwe, ESPN's No. 4 overall 2024 recruit, is committed to the Tide.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 7\nScouting the Hawkeyes: There's temptation to move Iowa even higher, especially after an exceptional season that helped offset a woeful offense in 2022. The Hawkeyes finished second nationally in both points allowed and yards allowed, and fourth in pass efficiency defense. Phil Parker, entering his 12th season as coordinator, is arguably the nation's top playcaller and defensive architect. But Parker will be challenged to reload after Iowa lost several standouts, including first-team All-America linebacker Jack Campbell, All-Big Ten defensive backs Kaevon Merriweather and Riley Moss, emerging pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and linebackers Seth Benson and Jestin Jacobs. Iowa needs a new group to carry the torch, such as ends Deontae Craig and Joe Evans, a group of veteran interior linemen headlined by Logan Lee, first-team All-Big Ten cornerback Cooper DeJean and emerging young safety Xavier Nwankpa, an ESPN four-star recruit in 2022.\nIowa's overall depth in the secondary actually might improve this fall as seniors Quinn Schulte and Sebastian Castro join Nwankpa at safety, and DeJean forms a solid cornerback tandem with Jermari Harris, who missed all of last season with injuries after recording four interceptions in 2021. The Hawkeyes also have plenty of options up front, even behind Craig and Evans at end with junior Ethan Hurkett. Linebacker is by far the biggest short-term question, as Iowa must build around senior Jay Higgins, who had 39 tackles last season. The team added productive Virginia transfer Nick Jackson. Iowa's recruiting rarely pops nationally, but linebacker Ben Kueter, a four-time state wrestling champion, headlines the 2023 class. The team also has 2024 commitments from ESPN 300 Preston Ries and four-star Cam Buffington.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 17\nScouting the Nittany Lions: Penn State is set up to push for its first Big Ten championship since 2016, and much of the optimism around Happy Valley stems from who returns on defense. Coordinator Manny Diaz had a solid first season and is back despite generating some interest for head-coaching vacancies. Diaz's aggressive scheme suits returning players such as ends Chop Robinson and Adisa Isaac, and linebacker Abdul Carter, a national awards candidate who recorded 6.5 sacks, 10.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles as a true freshman. Carter will help lead the defense through at least 2024, and Robinson is a true junior. Linebacker U has an excellent opportunity to uphold its tradition with Carter, Curtis Jacobs and Kobe King, who are all experienced and boast multiple years of eligibility left. Penn State actually has no seniors in its linebacker room and will lean on players such as junior Tyler Elsdon, who finished fourth on the team with 44 tackles last season.\nDefensive end projects as a strength with Robinson, Isaac, sophomore Dani Dennis-Sutton and junior Amin Vanover. Penn State loses mainstay P.J. Mustipher in the interior line but returns some experience with Hakeem Beamon and Coziah Izzard, who combined for 10 tackles for loss last fall. Zane Durant also emerged this spring as a young interior option. The secondary will miss standouts Ji'Ayir Brown and Joey Porter Jr., but junior Kalen King, senior Johnny Dixon and sophomore Zakee Wheatley are back after combining for seven interceptions last season. Jaylen Reed and Keaton Ellis provide some depth in the back end, and freshman Tony Rojas also impressed this spring. Penn State signed two of ESPN's top eight safety recruits for 2023 but could use a surge to solidify the 2024 and 2025 seasons.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 9Editor's PicksCollege football future Power Rankings: Quarterbacks8dAdam RittenbergWe picked spring portal sleepers: 8 transfers who could become household names in 20237dBilly TuckerRanking college football's 10 best running backs for 20237dESPN staff2 Related\nScouting the Tigers: LSU's defense is in a good spot after a solid but not spectacular 2022 season under a new coaching staff. The unit brings back star power, especially with linebacker Harold Perkins Jr. for at least two more seasons. But there are some holes to fill, especially in the secondary and up front, as B.J. Ojulari moves on to the NFL. The return of dynamic defensive tackle Maason Smith, injured while celebrating during the 2022 opener, helps a line that loses both Ojulari and end Ali Gaye. Smith and Mekhi Wingo, a third-team AP All-America selection who had three sacks and six tackles for loss, give the Tigers two interior stalwarts, both with multiple years of eligibility left. Junior end Sai'vion Jones could see a bigger role after finishing third on the team in sacks (4.5) last fall. Jacobian Guillory and Arizona transfer Paris Shand provide depth inside. Ovie Oghoufo, a Texas transfer with 13 career sacks, should help fill the pass-rushing gap.\nThe Tigers have one of the nation's best linebacker tandems in Perkins and Omar Speights, an Oregon State transfer who earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2022. The group also boasts junior Greg Penn III, who finished second on the team in tackles last season (78). Junior West Weeks is a solid depth player who had 28 tackles last season. Veteran safety Greg Brooks Jr. will lead the secondary after showing production and playmaking in 2022. Brooks and junior Major Burns project to start at safety. The cornerback spot is a bigger mystery, although LSU has options with transfers Duce Chestnut (Syracuse), Denver Harris (Texas A&M), JK Johnson (Ohio State) and Zy Alexander (Southeastern Louisiana), as well as holdovers such as Sage Ryan, an ESPN top-65 recruit in 2021. LSU also signed Javien Toviano (cornerback) and Da'Shawn Wommack (defensive end). The team's overall defensive recruiting remains promising.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 12\nScouting the Utes: Utah has become a more balanced program in recent years, but the defense remains the Utes' signature unit. Coach Kyle Whittingham's teams are never bad on defense, and often produce one of the nation's best groups. The 2023 Utes could be very good again, despite losing star cornerback Clark Phillips III and a few other key contributors. Utah returns its core, though, especially along the line and in the secondary, from a defense that finished second in the Pac-12 in scoring. Sacks leader Gabe Reid departs, but Utah brings back almost everyone else from its line, including tackles Junior Tafuna and Aliki Vimahi and ends Connor O'Toole, Van Fillinger and Jonah Elliss. Whittingham praised the ends this spring as arguably the team's deepest position group. Fillinger tied for second on the team with five sacks, while Elliss' two forced fumbles tied for the team lead. Tafuna earned second-team all-league honors. The best news: All five linemen have eligibility to return in 2024.\nPhillips' six interceptions will be tough to replace, but Utah has returning production in the secondary with junior safety Cole Bishop, the team's leading tackler in 2022, and several others. JaTravis Broughton is an experienced cornerback and safety Sione Vaki showed promise last fall as a true freshman, recording 41 tackles, 3.5 for loss and a forced fumble. Safety Nate Ritchie also came back from a church mission after starting five games in 2020, and Utah added cornerback transfer Miles Battle, who started four games at Ole Miss. Utah's linebacker group brings back junior Karene Reid and sophomore Lander Barton, who combined for 9.5 sacks and 17 tackles for loss last season, with Reid earning second-team All-Pac-12 honors. The Utes signed ESPN 300 end Hunter Clegg in the 2023 class.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 5\nScouting the Badgers: A jarring 2022 season for Wisconsin ended with Luke Fickell as head coach and defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard no longer with the team. Fickell's arrival brought sweeping changes, but less so for a defense that has been on a strong trajectory. Although the defense slipped a bit in 2022, it still finished 17th nationally in points allowed and 13th in yards per play allowed. Fickell's roots on defense run deep, and coordinator Mike Tressel has spent most of his career in the Big Ten at Michigan State. They inherit a unit that loses standouts in linebacker Nick Herbig and nose tackle Keeanu Benton, but returns strong overall production at linebacker, defensive end and elsewhere. Inside linebackers Maema Njongmeta and Jordan Turner combined for 163 tackles, including 5.5 sacks and 16.5 tackles for loss. Senior C.J. Goetz anchors the outside linebacker group after a productive 2022 season, and there's good depth with sophomore Darryl Peterson and junior Kaden Johnson.\nBenton will be missed up front, but Wisconsin returns veterans Rodas Johnson, James Thompson Jr. and Isaiah Mullens, who has 40 career appearances. The group needs pass-rushers, though, and seemingly received a major jolt with Temple transfer Darian Varner, who ranked 16th nationally in sacks per game last season. Senior Kamo'i Latu will stabilize the safety spot as Wisconsin tries to replace the opportunistic John Torchio (six interceptions). Junior Hunter Wohler and sophomore Preston Zachman add depth, and the Badgers regain Travian Blaylock, a projected starter last spring, from an ACL tear. Cornerback Alexander Smith also is back from injury, and sophomore Ricardo Hallman stood out this spring after starting eight games in 2022. Wisconsin added versatile Boston College transfer Jason Maitre. ESPN four-star recruit Jace Arnold also enters the mix. Fickell and his assistants should not only elevate Wisconsin's defensive recruiting but its ability to add key players from the portal.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Falcons: Not including the Falcons in last year's rankings was a significant oversight, as they rank eighth nationally in points allowed since 2018. I'm making up for it by placing them in the top 10. Last fall, Air Force led the nation in total defense, finished third in points allowed and second against the pass. Despite a coordinator change from John Rudzinski to Brian Knorr, the former Ohio head coach, Air Force remained on a very positive trajectory. The Falcons bring back several key contributors from their 2022 defense, including lineman Peyton Zdroik, who finished second on the team in both sacks (5.5) and tackles for loss (10) last season. Zdroik and Jayden Thiergood (seven tackles for loss in 2022) form a solid tandem up front, and will be supported by linebackers Alec Mock, Bo Richter and Johnathan Youngblood.\nThe secondary projects as the unit's strength, especially in the short term. Leading tackler Trey Taylor, a second-team All-Mountain West selection last season, is back at safety alongside Camby Goff and Jayden Goodwin. The three combined for seven interceptions and 18 pass breakups in 2022. Veteran cornerback Eian Castonguay (32 tackles last season) is also back with Jamari Bellamy. Air Force will lose a lot in 2024, although Zdroik, Bellamy and others are expected to return. Freshman defensive end Jack Curtis stood out during spring practice and could be pegged for a bigger role after this coming season.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 20\nScouting the Wolfpack: NC State's defense has reached a level where drop-offs should be limited despite key personnel turnover. The Wolfpack will miss All-ACC selections Drake Thomas (linebacker) and Tanner Ingle (safety), but coach Dave Doeren and veteran coordinator Tony Gibson have enough back to sustain momentum. Linebacker Payton Wilson's return for a sixth season gives NC State a proven leader for the unit. Wilson has 264 career tackles, including 30.5 for loss and nine sacks, as well as four interceptions. He'll be joined by senior Jaylon Scott, junior Devon Betty and younger players such as Caden Fordham. NC State returns an experienced line led by junior Davin Vann, who tied with Wilson for second on the team in sacks (4.5) last fall. Both Vann and junior tackle C.J. Clark could play through 2024, while senior end Savion Jackson has started parts of the past three seasons. NC State added end Red Hibbler, ESPN's No. 3 junior college transfer, as well as Cincinnati transfer Noah Potter for short-term depth. Sophomore end Travali Price should continue to blossom.\nThe secondary projects as the unit's strength for 2023 and possibly beyond. First-team All-ACC cornerback Aydan White leads the group after recording four interceptions and nine pass breakups last season. Junior Shyheim Battle is set to play opposite White, and both could return in 2024. Senior safety Jakeen Harris enters his third season as a starter, and will lead a group featuring some experience with Sean Brown and Rakeim Ashford. NC State signed ESPN four-star cornerback Daemon Fagan for 2023, and it continues to recruit well under Doeren.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 6\nScouting the Irish: Despite some late struggles, Notre Dame's defense remained on the right path in 2022. The challenge ahead for second-year coach Marcus Freeman and coordinator Al Golden is addressing key personnel losses up front, and ultimately taking the next step. Notre Dame returns an emerging superstar in sophomore cornerback Benjamin Morrison, who had six interceptions as a true freshman and will play at least through 2024. The Irish also have one of the nation's most seasoned linebacker groups, as seniors JD Bertrand, Jack Kiser and Marist Liufau are all back after combining for 191 tackles -- 18.5 for loss -- last season. Sophomore Jaylen Sneed and others, including incoming freshman Jaiden Ausberry -- ESPN's No. 59 overall recruit in 2023 -- should lead the group in 2023 and beyond.\nThe secondary has experience with Morrison, seniors DJ Brown, Clarence Lewis and Cam Hart, and Oklahoma State transfer Thomas Harper (35 career appearances). Sophomore cornerback Jaden Mickey should see an increased role, and incoming freshman Christian Gray is set to contribute, especially in 2024 and 2025. Notre Dame's line is the short-term concern after losing all-time sacks leader Isaiah Foskey and the Ademilola brothers (Justin and Jayson). Seniors Howard Cross III and Rylie Mills provide a nice foundation in the interior, and Jordan Botelho finished second on the team in sacks (4.5). The Irish also added Ohio State graduate transfer Javontae Jean-Baptiste, who will play significantly. Nana Osafo-Mensah is a veteran depth player, but the Irish will look to fast-track younger players such as sophomores Junior Tuihalamaka and Jason Onye and freshman Donovan Hinish. Notre Dame signed eight ESPN 300 defenders in 2023.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Illini: The Illinois defense seemed to be trending well after 2021, but few expected the spike that would follow last season. Illinois led the nation in fewest points allowed and ranked in the top 10 in all the major statistical categories. The unit produced All-America cornerback Devon Witherspoon and other standouts, and coordinator Ryan Walters was a Broyles Award finalist before taking the Purdue head-coaching job. Witherspoon and Walters are both gone, alongside All-Big Ten defensive backs Sydney Brown and Jartavius Martin, who combined for nine interceptions and 18 pass breakups. But Illinois received a big boost up front when Jer'Zhan Newton and Keith Randolph Jr., who combined for 10 sacks and 27 tackles for loss, both returned for the 2023 season. The Illini will need to build around them and prepare for 2024, as players such as TeRah Edwards and Bryce Barnes step into bigger roles.\nMuch like the defensive front, the linebackers project solidly for Illinois, which returns starting experience with Tarique Barnes. Barnes, a senior, finished third on the team with 8.5 tackles for loss in 2022. Depth players such as sophomore Kenenna Odeluga, who had two sacks and 3.5 tackles for loss in limited work last fall, should help for 2024 and beyond. Coach Bret Bielema promoted defensive backs coach Aaron Henry as coordinator, and Henry's familiarity with a mostly new-look secondary should help. Both safety and cornerback have short-term questions, although Illinois should be able to rely on sophomore safety Matthew Bailey, who had three interceptions in 2022. Transfer Nicario Harper, an all-league player at Jacksonville State who spent last season at Louisville, also could help. Illinois signed ESPN 300 cornerback Saboor Karriem in the 2023 class.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Gophers: Every Power Rankings release has teams that should have been included in the previous version, including Minnesota, which continues to be one of the most consistent defenses in college football. The Gophers ranked fourth nationally in fewest points allowed last season and are 10th since 2019. Joe Rossi is one of the nation's best emerging coordinators, and will return for his fifth season as playcaller and seventh overall. The Gophers lose linebacker Mariano Sori-Marin, safety Jordan Howden and other mainstays but bring back a nice core, especially with Tyler Nubin and Justin Walley both returning in the secondary. Nubin, a second-team All-Big Ten selection, and Walley combined for seven interceptions last season. They lead a secondary returning veteran safeties Darius Green and Coleman Bryson, and Southeastern Louisiana safety transfer Jack Henderson. But Minnesota needs cornerback help opposite Walley. Young corners Tariq Watson and Rhyland Kelly have a big summer ahead.\nCody Lindenberg moves into Minnesota's lead linebacker role following Sori-Marin's departure, and he should headline the group through at least the 2024 season. The Gophers added Western Michigan transfer Ryan Selig, who has 154 career tackles (13 for loss), but will rely on several young linebackers, including Devon Williams and Joey Gerlach. Junior end Danny Striggow and senior tackle Kyler Baugh, both honorable-mention All-Big Ten selections in 2022, anchor a defensive front that also includes veterans Darnell Jefferies and Jah Joyner, who should boost a lagging pass rush. The Gophers also added transfer end Chris Collins, who appeared in 46 games with North Carolina.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 3\nScouting the Aggies: Projecting Texas A&M's overall outlook beyond 2023 isn't easy, given the disastrous results last season and what they could mean if coach Jimbo Fisher doesn't turn things around soon. But the Aggies' defense still finished in the top 25 nationally in points allowed, and it returns a sizable group of high-level recruits who could break out this coming season. Texas A&M's historic 2022 defensive recruiting haul included linemen Walter Nolen, Shemar Stewart and LT Overton. Gabriel Brownlow-Dindy, another headliner of the 2022 class, should be a bigger factor as he comes off of a knee injury. The line also has veterans such as senior McKinnley Jackson and juniors Fadil Diggs and Shemar Turner, so depth should be a strength.\nTexas A&M lost several transfers in the back seven, including linebacker Andre White Jr. But senior Chris Russell Jr. and junior Edgerrin Cooper are back to lead the linebackers. Russell finished third on the team in tackles (66) and tied for second in tackles for loss (7), while Cooper led the team in TFLs in 2022. The Aggies must improve at cornerback and hope North Carolina transfer Tony Grimes will provide a lift alongside junior Tyreek Chappell and others. Their safety tandem of fifth-year senior Demani Richardson and junior Jardin Gilbert provides production and system knowledge. Richardson has 43 career starts, 245 tackles and four interceptions. The Aggies didn't match 2022 with their 2023 recruiting class but still landed lineman David Hicks, ESPN's No. 8 overall prospect, decorated cornerback Bravion Rogers (ESPN No. 63) and safety Dalton Brooks (No. 79 overall).\n2022 future defense power ranking: 18\nScouting the Wildcats: Kentucky fell well short of expectations last season, but the defense held up its end, finishing 11th nationally in yards allowed, 13th in points allowed and seventh against the pass. Coach Mark Stoops and coordinator Brad White have established a standard that should sustain through 2025. The immediate concern is bolstering a linebacker group that loses mainstays DeAndre Square and Jordan Wright, as well as All-SEC safety Keidron Smith. Senior inside linebacker D'Eryk Jackson will lead the linebacker group after recording a team-high 67 tackles last season. Kentucky also got a big boost with the return of J.J. Weaver, a captain in 2022 who has made starts in each of the past three seasons. Junior Trevin Wallace also is back after recording two interceptions and 5.5 tackles for loss last fall. Wallace, sophomore Keaten Wade and others will be key beyond 2023, including incoming freshmen Jayvant Brown and Grant Godfrey, both ESPN four-star recruits.\nSophomore tackle Deone Walker is a 6-foot-6, 348-pound force who should anchor the line for at least two more seasons. Kentucky needs more around him, especially at end, where sophomore Khalil Saunders, junior Tre'vonn Rybka and others will compete. Jamarius Dinkins is another intriguing interior lineman who should play several more seasons for UK, which added North Carolina transfer Keeshawn Silver. Like the line, Kentucky's secondary is filled with promising non-seniors, including sophomore safety Jordan Lovett, the team's No. 2 tackler last fall. Junior Zion Childress could play opposite Lovett this fall, and sophomore Maxwell Hairston stood out this spring. Cincinnati transfer JQ Hardaway is an interesting addition at cornerback, where junior Andru Phillips also returns. Cornerback Avery Stuart, an ESPN 300 selection, headlines Kentucky's 2023 recruiting class, along with ESPN four-star safety Jaremiah Anglin Jr.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Longhorns: Texas saw the improvement it hoped for on defense in 2022. The unit rose from 99th nationally in points allowed in 2021 to 27th, and from 102nd in yards per play allowed to 18th. The Longhorns held Alabama to 20 points, TCU to 17 points and shut out short-handed Oklahoma in the Red River game. Veteran coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski seemed to settle in, and Gary Patterson's influence on the defense also showed. Texas loses key contributors in the front seven but should be able to build around junior edge rusher Barryn Sorrell, linebacker Jaylan Ford, senior tackle T'Vondre Sweat and others. Ford earned first-team All-Big 12 honors in 2022 after leading Texas in tackles (119), interceptions (4) and forced fumbles (3), while tying for second in tackles for loss (10). He'll be complemented by veterans such as senior Jett Bush and junior Morice Blackwell Jr., and also emerging young players like freshman Anthony Hill, ESPN's top inside linebacker and No. 16 overall recruit in the 2023 class.\nThere's some reloading up front around Sowell and Sweat, as Texas loses Keondre Coburn, Moro Ojomo and Oghoufo. The team will turn to junior Byron Murphy II, senior Alfred Collins, junior Vernon Broughton and several younger players, including sophomore edge Justice Finkley and incoming freshman Sydir Mitchell, an ESPN top-70 national recruit. Texas projects well in the back end with dynamic safeties Jahdae Barron and Jerrin Thompson. Arkansas transfer Jalen Catalon, a Thorpe Award semifinalist in 2020 who struggled with injuries the past two seasons, could provide a big boost if healthy. Sophomore Michael Taaffe and others will emerge in 2024 and 2025. Texas has several non-senior options at cornerback, led by Ryan Watts but also including sophomore Terrance Brooks and Wake Forest transfer Gavin Holmes. The Longhorns signed four 2023 recruits ranked in ESPN's top 68, including defensive backs Malik Muhammad and Derek Williams.\n2022 future defense power rankings: Not ranked\nScouting the Seminoles: After languishing for several years during the Willie Taggart-Mike Norvell transition, FSU's defense took a significant step in 2022. The Seminoles led the ACC in yards allowed and finished third in points allowed, ranking in the top 20 nationally in both categories. They return many of their top players, including defensive end Jared Verse, the Albany transfer who earned first-team All-ACC honors after recording nine sacks and 17 tackles for loss in his first season with FSU. Verse leads a line that should continue to ascend. Redshirt sophomore end Patrick Payton is back after a five-sack season, along with veteran interior linemen Fabien Lovett Sr., Dennis Briggs Jr. and Malcolm Ray. Florida State added defensive tackle transfers Braden Fiske (Western Michigan) and Darrell Jackson Jr. (Miami) -- a massive body (6-foot-5, 326 pounds) who the coaches think could make a seismic impact. Along with Payton, sophomore Joshua Farmer should help for the next few seasons after recording six tackles for loss in 2022.\nSenior linebackers Tatum Bethune and Kalen DeLoach lead the linebackers after combining for 149 tackles, six sacks, 17 tackles for loss and 10 pass breakups. D.J. Lundy brings even more experience and production, although FSU will need to fill some gaps in 2024 and 2025 with Omar Graham Jr. and others. Jammie Robinson certainly will be missed at safety, but FSU boasts a good group of holdovers and transfers in the secondary, after finishing No. 4 nationally against the pass. Renardo Green and Akeem Dent are both back, along with fellow senior Jarrian Jones and junior Kevin Knowles II. Shyheim Brown started two games in his first full season and will be a multiyear factor. Virginia transfer Fentrell Cypress II is a major addition who led the nation in pass breakups per game (1.6) in 2022. FSU has been transfer-heavy but signed three ESPN 300 defenders in the 2023 class.\n2022 future defense power rankings: 25\nScouting the Broncos: After squeaking into the defense rankings last year, Boise State continued to strengthen the unit under coach Andy Avalos and coordinator Spencer Danielson. The Broncos finished sixth nationally in yards allowed and 15th in points allowed last season. They will miss All-Mountain West standouts JL Skinner and Ezekiel Noa but return linebacker DJ Schramm, who led the team in total tackles (110) and tackles for loss (11.5). Schramm will pair with sophomore Andrew Simpson, who had 29 tackles and three sacks last year, although Boise State will need to build depth for 2024 and 2025. The Broncos lose tackle Scott Matlock and several other key line contributors. Edge rusher Demitri Washington, who tied for the team lead with 4.5 sacks last season, returns for his sixth year. Junior Gabe Hunter and senior Cortez Hogans add depth on the perimeter. Juniors Herbert Gums and Ahmed Hassanein should solidify the interior line through 2024. Boise State bolstered its depth by adding line transfers Kivon Wright (Boston College), Tyler Wegis (Utah) and Sheldon Newton (Northern Arizona).\nThe secondary projects well through 2025, although there are some short-term gaps to fill after losing Skinner and others. Junior safety Rodney Robinson finished second on the team in interceptions (3) and fourth in tackles (50), and will lead the unit alongside versatile junior Seyi Oladipo. Junior Jaylen Clark is also back after recording an interception and five pass breakups last year. Senior cornerback Markel Reed missed all but one game last season with injury but started four contests in 2021. Linebacker Wyatt Milkovic, an ESPN three-star recruit, headlined Boise State's 2023 class.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Trojans: Troy won the increasingly competitive Sun Belt Conference under a first-year coach (Jon Sumrall) with an offense that finished 80th nationally in scoring and failed to score 18 points in five games. The defense was exceptional under Sumrall and coordinator Shiel Wood, who left for the same post at Tulane. Troy ranked No. 8 nationally in both points allowed and turnovers gained and in the top 25 in several other key statistical categories. The unit will miss linebacker Carlton Martial, who set the FBS career tackles record with 526, and other key members. But Troy brings back several standouts, including top pass-rushers T.J. Jackson and Richard Jibunor, both All-Sun Belt selections who combined for 15.5 sacks and 25.5 tackles for loss last season. Junior bandit Javon Solomon complements the rush after recording 4.5 sacks in 2022. Reddy Steward, who led Troy in interceptions (3) and pass breakups (12), also will be back to team with fellow senior cornerback O'shai Fletcher.\nTroy's immediate challenge is replacing Martial and safety Craig Slocum Jr., who combined for 237 tackles last season, as well as first-team all-conference lineman Will Choloh and safety TJ Harris. Senior safety Dell Pettus is back after a 65-tackle season, and junior Keyshawn Swanson will take on a bigger role through 2024. The Trojans also added Iowa transfer Reggie Bracy, who appeared in 22 games for the Hawkeyes. Like safety, linebacker is an immediate question, as sophomores Terry Thomas and Jordan Stringer emerge alongside Jayden McDonald, who was limited to three games last season. Troy also added junior college standouts Raymond Cutts and T.J. Thompson.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 11\nScouting the Buckeyes: The unit has regressed for most of coach Ryan Day's tenure, although it showed clear improvement last season, especially on third down, before breakdowns in losses to Michigan and Georgia. For Day, a coach who has taken the quarterback position to historic heights in Columbus, the primary mission remains getting the defense back on track. Coordinator Jim Knowles enters his second season and will be working with enough high-level talent to clean things up in the next three years. All three levels of defense return key contributors. The line should become a major strength again, especially if ends J.T. Tuimoloau and Jack Sawyer, both ESPN top-five recruits, consistently hit their potential. Sophomores Caden Curry and Kenyatta Jackson should provide production, especially in 2024. Hopes are high at the defensive tackle spot where veterans Ty Hamilton and Tyleik Williams return, as well as junior Mike Hall Jr., who logged 4.5 sacks last fall.\nLinebacker projects well in the short term with seniors Tommy Eichenberg and Steele Chambers both back in 2023. Eichenberg earned first-team All-Big Ten honors last fall after recording 120 tackles, including 12 for loss. Cody Simon is a solid third option who should lead the group in 2024, along with sophomores C.J. Hicks and Gabe Powers. The secondary faces pressure this season but also has some familiar names -- senior safety Lathan Ransom and junior cornerback Denzel Burke -- as well as a key new one in safety Ja'Had Carter, a transfer from Syracuse who started three seasons. Junior Jordan Hancock, sophomore Jyaire Brown and Ole Miss transfer Davison Igbinosun are in the mix at cornerback, while Sonny Styles, ESPN's No. 15 overall recruit in 2022, should be a bigger contributor soon along with Cameron Martinez. Ohio State's 2023 recruiting class was underwhelming by their standard but still includes six ESPN 300 defenders.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Beavers: Few units had a bigger breakthrough in 2022 than Oregon State, which led the Pac-12 in total defense, scoring defense and rushing defense, after struggling for much of 2021. Trent Bray, promoted from interim coordinator to the permanent role in December 2021, masterfully oversaw a renaissance, as Oregon State finished 16th nationally in points allowed. Oregon State will miss Speights, its tackles leader who transferred to LSU, as well as star defensive backs Rejzohn Wright and Alex Austin. Riley Sharp, who had a team-high three sacks last season, has moved to tight end. The Beavers will need more from their defensive line, which returns veterans such as James Rawls and Isaac Hodgins, as well as non-seniors Sione Lolohea and Oluwaseyi Omotosho, a transfer from Wyoming. Freshman Kelze Howard is an intriguing young prospect. Bray and coach Jonathan Smith both recently told ESPN that the line should be the unit's strength in 2023.\nVeteran linebackers John McCartan and Easton Mascarenas-Arnold will try to offset the losses of Speights and Kyrei Fisher-Morris. Senior Andrew Chatfield, who had 20 tackles last season, is ready for a bigger role, along with junior Cory Stover. Bray really likes the physical skills that junior Makiya Tongue brings and thinks he could be a breakout player. The Beavers also hope Mason Tufaga, an ESPN top-180 recruit who never found the field at Utah, can contribute in the future. Safety Kitan Oladapo's return for a final season is huge for a reloading secondary, which also regains senior cornerback Ryan Cooper Jr., the team's leader in interceptions (3) and pass breakups (11) last season. Oregon State needs to build around Cooper with junior Skyler Thomas (29 tackles in 2022) and others. The Beavers will remain a developmental program but signed ESPN four-star defensive end Kelze Howard in the 2023 class.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 22\nScouting the Cyclones: I considered removing ISU after a last-place finish in the Big 12, but the defense is still far from the problem in Ames. The Cyclones finished fourth nationally in yards allowed, 18th in points allowed, 13th against the run and eighth in efficiency. Since 2019, ISU is ninth nationally in efficiency. Although some key contributors depart, including edge rusher Will McDonald IV and linebacker O'Rien Vance, coordinator Jon Heacock remains as one of the nation's best. ISU's defense is set up to continue on a positive trajectory. Second-team All-Big 12 cornerback T.J. Tampa returns and will pair with Myles Purchase, a junior who had 41 tackles last year. Junior safety Beau Freyler also is back in the secondary after finishing second on the team with 68 tackles. Freyler, Jeremiah Cooper, Malik Verdon and Trevon Howard are all safeties who can help carry ISU beyond the 2023 season.\nSenior Gerry Vaughn headlines the linebacker group after recording a team-high 71 tackles in 2022. ISU must build around him this year with players such as Jacob Ellis, a junior college All-America selection in 2021 who redshirted last year. The team will need Ellis and several other non-seniors to carry the group in 2024. Junior defensive end Joey Petersen steps into a bigger pass-rushing role after McDonald and MJ Anderson's departures. Petersen and other non-seniors, such as junior J.R. Singleton and sophomore Tyler Onyedim, are set to lead the line for several more seasons. Senior tackle Isaiah Lee gives the group a veteran presence.\n2022 future defense power ranking: Not ranked\nScouting the Herd: Here's another Sun Belt team entering the Power Rankings after an impressive stretch, punctuated by a 2022 season in which it ranked sixth nationally in points allowed (16 ppg) and seventh in fewest yards per play against (4.75 ypp). Marshall will miss several standout players and coordinator Lance Guidry, who left to oversee Miami's defense, but there's excitement about Jason Semore's arrival and Chevis Jackson's promotion to co-coordinator. The Herd will once again be led by first-team All-Sun Belt selections Owen Porter at defensive end and Micah Abraham at cornerback, along with leading tackler Eli Neal and others. Porter will anchor the line alongside senior Sam Burton, who had five sacks and seven quarterback hurries last season. TyQaze Leggs also is back to fortify the interior after a three-sack season, and junior Elijah Alston could be set for a bigger role. Marshall also added Florida transfer Chris Thomas.\nAbraham, who had six interceptions in 2022, headlines a secondary that should be Marshall's strength in the short term and potentially beyond 2023. Semore likes the 4-2-5 alignment and should feature plenty of DBs. The group returns safety Kerion Martin, who had 42 tackles last season, and cornerback Jadarius Green-McKnight, who enters his second year with the team after transferring from Florida State. Cornerback Daytione Smith, who has sophomore eligibility, should see more field time, and Marshall brought in cornerback J.J. Roberts, a Wake Forest transfer. Neal is the only major returning contributor at linebacker, but Marshall added transfer KeSean Brown, who appeared in 49 games with Appalachian State. Other transfers include linemen Kylen McCracken (Ohio) and Michael Green (Virginia), and linebacker Tah Mac Bright (Incarnate Word). Linebacker Jaden Yates leads a solid group of incoming defensive recruits.\n2022 future defense power ranking: 16\nScouting the Aztecs: Like several teams included in this Power Rankings version, San Diego State didn't reach its overall goals in 2022 but continued to excel on defense. The Aztecs finished 19th nationally in both points allowed and rushing yards allowed, and 15th in total yards allowed. There's also a longevity component, as San Diego State ranks fifth nationally in points allowed since 2018. The Aztecs lose a lot from the 2022 defense, including first-team All-Mountain West selections Jonah Tavai, Caden McDonald and Patrick McMorris, and second-team selection Michael Shawcroft, so some short-term regression is possible. But coach Brady Hoke must feel good about who returns in the back seven, which will feature senior linebacker Cooper McDonald and dynamic cornerback tandem Dallas Branch and Dezjhon Malone. SDSU also has experience at safety with seniors Cedarious Barfield and Davaughn Celestine, who finished fourth and fifth on the team in tackles last fall. New Mexico transfer Cody Moon, an honorable-mention all-league selection in 2022, adds depth at linebacker, along with seniors Vai Kaho and Kyron White, a converted safety. Sophomore safety Eric Butler shined in the spring game alongside junior cornerback Noah Avinger.\nSan Diego State's immediate challenge comes up front, where it must replace both Jonah and Justus Tavai, and productive end Keshawn Banks. Senior Garret Fountain should help after recording three sacks and six tackles for loss in 2022, and veteran holdovers such as Daniel Okpoko and Wyatt Draeger likely will take on bigger roles. The Aztecs went to the portal for help, adding transfers such as Samuela Tuihalamaka (Oklahoma State) and Talib Salahuddin (Riverside City College). If they can hold up, the defense should continue to remain among the best in the Mountain West.""}",Jonathan Tah,en
"{'content': 'Welcome to April. This week I\'ve got reviews of new albums from Mudhoney, FACS, Tricky collaborator Marta, electronic producer James Holden, Kings of Convenience\'s\xa0Erlend\xa0Øye\xa0and Marbled Eye offshoot Public Interest.\nOnce again it\'s a much bigger week in Notable Releases as Andrew reviews new records by Wednesday, Scowl, Blondshell, and more.\nMore Basement-related content: The Clash\'s Paul Simonon made an album with Galen Ayers (daughter of Soft Machine\'s Kevin Ayers) that features Damon Albarn and more; Ride\'s Andy Bell\xa0announced a collaborative album\xa0with ambient jazz duo Masal; New Orleans\' Silver Synthetic are back; Underworld are back in action; that new DC club that\'s a replica of the original 9:30 Club is opening next month; and if you\'ve ever wondered what Depeche Mode could do with Gordon Lightfoot\'s soft rock classic ""Sundown,""\xa0your dreams have come true.\nThe\xa0Indie Basement corner of the BV online shop\xa0is a good place to blow\xa0your tax refund with\xa0vinyl, books and merch\xa0from Love & Rockets, The Raincoats, King Gizzard, Cocteau Twins, Grant Lee Buffalo, The Lemonheads, DEBBY FRIDAY, Sleaford Mods, Belle & Sebastian, New Pornographers, Naima Bock, Stereolab, Protomartyr, Mogwai, The Flaming Lips, Bowie, and lots more.\nHead below for this week\'s reviews...\nALBUM OF THE WEEK: FACS - Still Life in Decay (Trouble in Mind)Gleaming, propulsive and compelling, it\'s the\xa0Chicago trio\'s fifth and best album yet\nWith Still Life in Decay, Chicago trio FACS have moved out of the shadows, from behind the clouds. They are still an ominous, gothic monolith; heavy like a white dwarf but now gleaming\xa0like obsidian. Brian Case\'s vocals,\xa0partially hidden\xa0and mutated by reverb and other effects on the group\'s four previous albums, emerge from the haze unobscured, presenting a confident, seething frontman. As usual, FACS are powered by the formidable rhythm section: Alianna Kalaba\'s\xa0steely, sky-scraping bass lines that fire like rocket boosters sending their songs ever upward, and Noah Leger\'s\xa0crushing, precise\xa0drumming. With Case\'s highly atmospheric guitarwork, Still Life in Decay is a triangulated attack of post-rock, post-hardcore,\xa0and post-punk. It\'s not demonstrably different than their other records, but everything is refined and noticeably lifted.\nTake for example, the massive ""You Say."" No one would ever\xa0confuse\xa0it for a pop song -- up front as his vocals are here, Case doesn\'t so much sing as bark -- but the bass hook is undeniable and this is as big a banger as they\'ve ever created. The other five songs, including epics ""Still Life"" and ""New Flag"" which make up all of Side 2, are equally as memorable, mixing dub techniques with experimental rock, muscular playing, subtle ambience and, as always, a palpable sense of dread.\xa0Still Life in Decay is such a perfect encapsulation of what they do, I\'m not sure where\xa0FACS go from here, though knowing them the next record might already be finished. With\xa0Kalaba having departed after making\xa0this one, and original member Jonathan van Herik back in the band, perhaps they will blow it all up and start building\xa0a\xa0totally new menacing high-rise.\n--\nMudhoney - Plastic Eternity (Sub Pop)The Seattle legends are older but still snotty on their 11th album\nThe snottiest of Seattle\'s OG grunge generation (OGGG), Mudhoney have been\xa0defiantly flipping the bird and shouting ""who\'s next?"" for 35 years and have been one of the most consistent of their peers as well. The band have slowed their roll a little, having dropped back to a clockwork once-every-five-years release\xa0schedule since 2008, but they haven\'t mellowed one iota. Plastic Eternity continues with the apocalyptic\xa0anxiety of 2018\'s Digital Garbage, but adds in all the crap of the last\xa0three years to the mix, with Mark Arm\'s wicked sense of humor in especially fine form. ""Cry Me an Atmospheric River,"" one of 2023\'s best song titles, imagines the earth\'s climate system as an apex predator that has no pity for the ones who turned up the thermostat. ""I will always be here, heating and cooling / It doesn’t matter to me what happens to the humans,"" Arm sneers against a maelstrom of mutoid psych rock. ""Cascades of Crap,"" another great title, follows a similar unsubtle but effective tack. There\'s also ""Here Comes the Flood,"" which lampoons anti-vaxxers and Ivermectin users,\xa0while ""Human Stock Capital"" aims its darts at the ugly gig economy many of us are stuck in. The album does have a couple sweet moments too: ""Paul Herman\'s Hermits"" is an ode to Pere Ubu\'s on-again-off-again guitarist, and the album ends with ""Little Dogs,"" a tribute to Arm\'s pomeranian, Russell. (""Sure they get wound up, but they’re easy to distract / Just pick ‘em up or give ‘em a tasty tiny snack""). Plastic Eternity may not be as essential as Superfuzz Bigmuff or Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge, but it\'s always good to have them back. As Arm puts it, ""Some people have poker night or whatever the fuck, and they have the excuse to get together with their friends. For us, Mudhoney is that. This is what we do.” May they never stop.\n--\nPublic Interest - Spiritual Pollution (Erste Theke Tontraeger)Chris Natividad of Marbled Eye offers off up a bleak vision on his second Public Interest album\nWhen not playing in Oakland\'s post-punk inspired band Marbled Eye, Chris Natividad\xa0makes even more gothy post-punk as Public Interest. There\'s a nice emphasis on the punk side of things here, and Spiritual Pollution -- the project\'s second album -- has a real snarling energy to it. The album reminds me a lot of Belfast band Girls Names, and as they broke up in 2019 this fills a bit of a void. Not that there aren\'t a bunch of other dystopic groups slashing with dark abandon out there, but Natividad attacks with true bleak vision;\xa0when he sings ""Why bother at all?"" he means it, man. On spiderweb rippers like that one, ""Residue"" and ""Undone,"" he shows innate skill at weaving together snaking guitar parts, moody basslines and icy synths to create a palpable air of romantic nihilism.\n--\nJames Holden - Imagine This Is A High Dimensional Space Of All Possibilities (Border Community)A work of hallucinatory post-rave beauty from this veteran UK producer\nBritish producer James Holden has been part of the electronic community for over two decades, running the Borden Community label, remixing everyone from Madonna\xa0to New Order, and dabbling in everything from IDM to EDM and most points in between. These days, he occupies a space somewhere\xa0in the quirky ambient world that owes equal parts to new age and rave comedown music. He\'s cited The KLF\'s seminal Chill Out as an influence, and you can also hear The Orb, Boards of Canada, and 808 State in what he does. (True heads would probably name less obvious comparisons.) Imagine a High Dimensional Space of All Possibilities is Holden\'s fourth album under his own name and is a conscious look back at\xa0the blissful\xa0\'90s. “I wanted this to be my most open record, uncynical, naive, unguarded, the record teenage me wanted to make,” Holden says. “I used to balance my clock-radio on a wardrobe to catch the faint pirate FM signals from the nearest city, dreaming of what raves would be like when I could finally escape and become a New Age traveller. So it’s like a dream of rave, a fantasy about a transformative music culture that would make the world better. I guess it’s also a dialogue with that teenage me.” Full of percolating modular synths, lilting sax, gentle beats, and nature sounds,\xa0Imagine a High Dimensional Space of All Possibilities\xa0has a few songs\xa0that\xa0could fill a dancefloor, but nothing that would disturb your sleep at normal volume. That\'s\xa0not a criticism. It\'s wallpaper, but gorgeous, compelling wallpaper to get lost in.\n--\nMarta and Tricky - When It\'s Going Wrong (False Idols)Tricky vocalist goes solo...sort of\nPolish singer\xa0Marta Zlakowska was a bartender when, in 2017, a chance meeting with Tricky altered her career path dramatically, and she\'s become the trip hop icon\'s chief vocalist for the last six years. Her smoky\xa0voice and chilled out delivery is at times uncannily like original Tricky vocalist\xa0Martina Topley Bird, and has been no small part in\xa0his creative rebirth. (If you haven\'t checked in with Adrian Thaws in a while, his recent stuff is worth a spin.) After appearing on a number of Tricky\'s records, he\'s helped\xa0Marta make her solo debut, producing the album and writing eight of the nine tracks. (PR calls it a solo album but streaming services credit it to both.) He adds his signature whispering vocals to a few tracks, too, which means it\'s almost indistinguishable in style from his 2020 album, Fall to Pieces. Nothing wrong with that either -- it\'s\xa0minimal and moody in all the right ways,\xa0with warm, slow pulses of synthesizer, muted guitar, strings, and the chillest of beats. Their voices sound great together.\xa0Also like Fall to Pieces, none of the 10 songs crack the three minute mark, and though the album is shorter than many King Gizzard songs, it doesn\'t feel underbaked.\xa0The record could use a little more to distinguish itself from other releases on Tricky\'s False Idols label; only ""Czarno Czarny,"" a cover of on an early \'70s song by Polish folk singer Mira Kubasińska, feels like something Tricky wouldn\'t do.\n--\nErlend Øye - Winter Companion (Bubbles Records)The Kings of Convenience co-founder\'s quickly recorded EP is highlighted by a cover of Glen Campbell\'s ""Wichita Lineman""\n""It\'s been a dream for me to release songs that I have written while they are still fresh out of the oven,""\xa0Erlend Øye of Kings of Convenience, a duo known for taking their time with their records, getting every note and detail right.\xa0His new solo EP proudly states\xa0on the cover that it was\xa0""Recorded in Mexico City January 2023"" and two of the songs were written then as well. The dashed off nature of this EP is felt -- it\'s pretty slight but nonetheless fun. The first two songs are\xa0spider and sharks that could almost be children\'s songs, while the best two tracks are covers: Jimmy Webb/Glen Campbell\'s ""Wichita Lineman"" which he pronounces ""Witchie-Tah"" and The Moore Brothers\' affecting ""New for You."" I appreciate\xa0Øye\'s usual tendency to sweat the small stuff, but it\'s also great to hear him just put\xa0songs out in the world like this.\nAnd check out what\'s new in our shop.\n--'}",Jonathan Tah,en
"{'content': 'Ganz entspannt beim Frühstück in Amsterdam: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nBayer Leverkusen ist unter Xabi Alonso (41) jetzt 14 Pflichtspiele in Folge in der  Bundesliga und der  Europa League unbesiegt. Eine beeindruckende Serie.\nNach dem 0:0 bei Union Berlin hatte die Werkself zwei Tage frei. Auch der Bayer-Trainer nutzte die Auszeit vor den wichtigen Duellen gegen den  1.

Amiri war der Held im Hinspiel beim 2:1-Sieg in Müngersdorf: Kurz nach seiner Einwechselung traf er per Freistoß zum 1:1, Bayer drehte die Partie anschließend durch Moussa Diaby (23) komplett.\n\nNadiem Amiri (l.) umarmt Team-Kollege Jeremie Frimpong\nNach BILD-Informationen steht Amiri vor einer vorzeitigen Verlängerung bei Bayer über 2024 hinaus – die Gespräche mit dem Mittelfeldspieler laufen.  Dem Spieler liegen auch Angebote aus Spanien, Italien und England vor.\nBayers Klub-Macher und auch Trainer Alonso schätzen an Amiri vor allem seine Einstellung, seinen Willen und seine Vielseitigkeit. Er hatte sich nach seiner Leih-Rückkehr vom Italien-Absteiger CFC Genua im vergangenen Sommer selbst wieder in die Mannschaft gekämpft. Er hatte auf einen erneuten Wechsel verzichtet und wollte sich in Leverkusen durchbeißen.

"{'content': 'Stark auch im defensiven Mittelfeld: Leverkusen-Profi Edmond Tapsoba\nDas 0:0 von  Bayer Leverkusen im  Bundesliga-Auswärtsspiel bei  Union Berlin hatte einen Gewinner: Trainer Xabi Alonso (41).\nDer Coach überraschte an der Alten Försterei mit einer neuen taktischen Maßnahme: Überraschend stand Verteidiger Edmond Tapsoba (24) als defensiver Mittelfeldspieler in der Leverkusener Startformation.\nIm Verlaufe der Saison verblüffte Xabi schon mit einigen Maßnahmen, z.B. ließ er Robert Andrich (28) dreimal in der Bundesliga als Abwehrchef ran.  „Libero“ nennt Alonso dann Andrich. Bei Union bildete Abwehr-Star Tapsoba erstmals die Doppel-Sechs mit Andrich.\n\nWas dahinter steckt Union-Fans pfeifen DFB-Star 90 Minuten aus\n„Ich habe die ganze Woche darüber nachgedacht“, sagte Alonso nach der Partie und begründete seine Entscheidung: „Palacios war verletzt und Amiri gesperrt. Wir hatten noch Demirbay und Andrich. Wir wissen, dass Eddy diese Position spielen und der Mannschaft Kontrolle und Balance geben kann.“\nTapsoba brauchte etwas Zeit, um sich in der neuen Rolle einzufinden, nach einem Ballverlust hatte er aber das Spiel immer im Griff. Er gewann 78 Prozent seiner Zweikämpfe – das war der Leverkusener Topwert in dieser Partie.\n„Nach zehn Minuten wurden wir stabiler. Eddy hat es sehr gut gemacht.

Daran hat Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah entscheidenden Anteil. Der Nationalspieler spielt seit Wochen in Topform, hält sich aber trotzdem medial zurück - obwohl er im Sommer einen Wechsel anstrebt.\nGibt lieber auf, statt neben dem Platz den Ton vor: Jonathan Tah.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Chai v.d. Laage\nIn den ersten Wochen unter Xabi Alonso war sein Status unklar. Uneingeschränkt gesetzt im Abwehrzentrum war Jonathan Tah nicht, nachdem der neue Trainer den Werksklub Anfang Oktober übernommen hatte. Im November versuchte es der Spanier mal mit Edmond Tapsoba in der Mitte der Dreierkette, ließ den deutschen Nationalspieler beim 5:0 gegen Union Berlin erst mal auf der Bank oder setzte ihn drei Tage darauf beim 2:1-Sieg in Köln rechts in der Dreierkette ein, was für den Innenverteidiger in die Hose ging.\nXabi Alonso (""Das war mein Fehler"") nahm damals die Schuld für Tahs schwache Leistung auf seine Kappe. Und hob drei Tage später, nach dem 2:0-Sieg gegen Stuttgart, bei dem Tah - zurück im Abwehrzentrum - wieder überzeugte, dessen Funktion als Führungsspieler hervor, um ihn beim Wiederauftakt in Gladbach (3:2) erneut erst mal auf die Bank zu setzen.\nEine Episode, nach der die schon in den vergangenen zwei Jahren vorhandenen Gedanken an einen Vereinswechsel bei Tah gereift sein dürften. Inzwischen ist dieser aus Sicht des Spielers beschlossene Sache. Seit Anfang des Jahres lässt Tah sich vom Transferexperten Pini Zahavi beraten. Ein eindeutiges Zeichen dafür, dass er nach acht Jahren bei Bayer den nächsten Schritt in seiner Karriere nehmen möchte.\nDen Klub hat der Hüne darüber bereits längst informiert. Eine Ausstiegsklausel in seinem noch bis 2025 laufenden Vertrag gibt die Konditionen für einen Wechsel vor. Diese liegt unter 20 Millionen Euro, womit Tah in seiner derzeitigen Form zumindest für den englischen Markt schon ein ""Schnäppchen"" wäre.\nAktuell trägt der 27-Jährige seinen Teil dazu bei, um sich den Traum von einem Wechsel zu einem ambitionierten Klub in einer ausländischen Top-Liga zu realisieren - er liefert herausragende Leistungen am Stück ab. In diesem Kalenderjahr liegt sein kicker-Notenschnitt bei 2,73. Tendenz steigend.\nSeit der bis dato letzten Leverkusener Niederlage, dem 2:3 gegen Mainz Mitte Februar, erspielte sich Tah gar eine Durchschnittsnote von 2,4. Nachdem ihn Xabi Alonso beim 2:1-Sieg gegen Bayern München Mitte März aus taktischen Gründen nicht in die Startelf berief, ließ der Innenverteidiger als Antwort sechs Partien mit einer Durchschnittsnote von 2,0 folgen.\nIch habe Jona noch nie so stark gesehen wie in den letzten Wochen. Unfassbar, wie er sich gerade entwickelt.\nTah steht sinnbildlich für die neue Leverkusener Defensivstärke und Stabilität. Nicht umsonst schwärmte Mittelfeldspieler Nadiem Amiri jüngst nach dem 2:0 gegen Leipzig: ""Ich habe Jona noch nie so stark gesehen wie in den letzten Wochen. Unfassbar, wie er sich gerade entwickelt."" Geschäftsführer Simon Rolfes attestierte dem Abwehrspieler: ""Er ist in Topform.""\nAuch Xabi Alonso sparte nicht mit Lob. Mit dem Blick auf Tahs herausragende Leistung beim 4:1-Sieg im Viertelfinal-Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise erklärte der Spanier nach dem Leipzig-Spiel: ""Am Donnerstag hat Jona es super gemacht und gegen Leipzig auch. Er ist ein Leader.""\nUnd ein Teamplayer. Würden viele andere Profis ihren persönlichen Lauf nutzen, um für sich die Werbetrommel auch medial zu rühren, so hält sich Tah in dieser Beziehung trotz seiner starken Leistungen am Fließband zurück. Der Grund: Der Profi möchte nicht für Unruhe während des für den Klub so entscheidenden Endspurts in der Meisterschaft sowie in der Europa League sorgen. Nach dem Motto: Kein Lärm um Viel.\nHält Tahs Hoch bis Saisonende an, hilft dies am Ende ihm und dem Klub. Mit einem starken Tah können Bayer und der Spieler ihre sportlichen Ziele eher erreichen. Und Tah selbst würde damit die Wahrscheinlichkeit erhöhen, dass sein künftiger Klub einer mit möglichst großer Strahlkraft sein wird, der an Bayer die festgeschriebene Ablöse zahlt.\nLesen Sie auch: Verlegung offiziell: Zwei Freitagsspiele am 31.

"{'content': 'Seit 13 Spielen wettbewerbsübergreifend ungeschlagen, Platz vier in der Rückrundentabelle und im Halbfinale der Europa League. Bayer Leverkusen ist in der Bundesliga derzeit das Team der Stunde und auf dem besten Weg, eine eigentlich schon verkorkst geglaubte Saison zu retten.\nGanze fünf Punkte und Tabellenplatz 17 standen Leverkusen nach acht Spieltagen zu Buche. Trainer Gerardo Seoane musste seinen Hut nehmen und wurde durch Xabi Alonso ersetzt, der die Werkself innerhalb eines halben Jahr umkrempelte und zurück in die Erfolgsspur führte.\nGerade einmal sechs Gegentore ließ Bayer Leverkusen in den vergangenen acht Bundesligaspielen zu, was auch mit einem Mann zu tun hat, der wieder erstarkt ist - Jonathan Tah.\nDer 27-Jährige präsentiert sich seit einigen Wochen in absoluter Topform und sorgt gemeinsam mit Defensivkollege Edmond Tapsoba für Stabilität in der Bayer-Hintermannschaft. Nicht wenige sehen im Abwehrchef den Hauptgrund für den aktuellen Lauf der Werkself.\n„Er ist ein Leader“, erklärte Alonso nach dem 2:0-Sieg gegen RB Leipzig und auch Tah-Kumpel Nadiem Amiri schwärmte: „Ich habe Jona noch nie so stark gesehen wie in den letzten Wochen. Das ist unfassbar, wie er sich gerade entwickelt.“\nAuch Tah, der in der Hinrunde nicht immer gesetzt war, freute sich zuletzt über sein aktuelles Hoch: „Ich weiß, dass ich sehr gut in Form bin, und das schon seit ein paar Wochen“, erläuterte er nach dem überzeugenden 4:1-Sieg in der Europa League bei Union Saint-Gilloise und lobte im WDR vor allem eines: „Gewinnermentalität. Dieser Teamgeist, den wir aktuell als Mannschaft haben.“\nIm Halbfinale der Europa League trifft Bayer auf die AS Rom, der Rückstand auf einen Champions-League-Platz in der Liga beträgt fünf Spieltage vor Ende sechs Punkte. Wichtige Wochen stehen für den 27-Jährigen an, der noch ein weiteres Ziel vor Augen hat - die Rückkehr in die Nationalmannschaft und die damit einhergehende Teilnahme an der Heim-EM 2024.\nUnter Bundestrainer Hansi Flick spielte der 16-malige Nationalspieler bislang kaum eine Rolle, verzeichnete im Juni 2022 gegen Italien zuletzt einen Kurzeinsatz im DFB-Dress. Auch für die WM in Katar wurde Tah nicht berücksichtigt, was er nun mit starken Leistungen wieder ändern will. „Ich fühle mich sehr gut. Das Wichtigste ist, dass ich fit bin, alles andere liegt nicht in meiner Kontrolle“, erläuterte der Abwehrchef.\nBis Juni 2025 steht Tah noch bei Bayer Leverkusen unter Vertrag, ein Wechsel nach der laufenden Saison scheint allerdings durchaus möglich. Erst im Februar schloss sich der Abwehrhüne dem bekannten Spielerberater Pini Zahavi an, der unter anderem auch Robert Lewandowski und Christopher Nkunku berät. Ziel eines Transfers könnte die Premier League sein, in der er vor allem eines benötigen würde - Spielpraxis.\nDiese ist Grundvoraussetzung für Tah, soll es mit einem Comeback in der Nationalmannschaft klappen. In Leverkusen wäre diese nach bärenstarken Leistungen zweifelsfrei gegeben.\nCopyright © 2023 Sport1 GmbH. Alle Rechte vorbehalten.'}",Jonathan Tah,de

Zahavi ist ein absoluter Fachmann für England-Transfers.\nWohin könnte es Tah nach acht Jahren Leverkusen ziehen?\nWest Ham United gilt als ein ganz konkreter Interessent. Im vergangenen Winter klopfte Nottingham Forest vergeblich an, angeblich soll es ein Angebot über 26 Millionen Euro gegeben haben.\nTah sagt zu BILD über seine Zukunft nur: „Wir stehen im Halbfinale der  Europa League, haben noch fünf Bundesliga-Spiele, darauf liegt mein Fokus. Alles andere wird man sehen.“\nÜber seinen Formanstieg spricht Tah dagegen schon deutlich lieber: „Wenn man sich nicht weiterentwickelt, ist ja irgendetwas falsch. Ich arbeite sehr, sehr hart an mir, das war schon immer so. Ich gebe sehr viel Gas, was sehr viele vielleicht nicht mitbekommen. Jetzt ernte ich die Lorbeeren.“ Und das Lob von Trainer Xabi Alonso (41), der auch großen Anteil an Tahs Aufschwung hat: „Jona ist ein Leader.“\n\nEigenartige Szene!

Der 4:1-Sieg bei Saint-Gilles und der damit verbundene Einzug in das Halbfinale der Europa League sorgte viel Freude bei der Werkself, die Belastung war dem Team drei Tage später im Ligaspiel gegen RB Leipzig aber anzumerken. Das Team von Xabi Alonso wirkte müde - und überließ das Spiel deshalb über weite Strecken dem Gegner, während man sich selbst auf konsequentes Verteidigen beschränkte.\nMit Erfolg. Trotz Dominanz gelang es dem spielstarken Gegner nicht, den Defensivverbund um Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah vor große Probleme zu stellen - obwohl Edmond Tapsoba verletzungsbedingt erstmals in dieser Bundesliga-Saison nicht auf dem Feld stand. Weil man sich vorne auch noch extrem effizient zeigte, einen Konter sauber zu Ende spielte und mit einem Foulelfmeter nachlegte, ging man als Sieger vom Platz.\n""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft"", sagte Tah bei ""DAZN"". ""Das war kein einfaches Spiel heute, vor allem in der ersten Halbzeit. Wir haben nicht so viel aufs Tor zugelassen, haben einfach wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt und das hat Spaß gemacht.""\nAuch Teamkollege Robert Andrich zeigte sich begeistert ob der nun schon 13 Pflichtspiele andauernden Ungeschlagen-Serie: ""Jeder Sieg macht Spaß, aber solche Siege heute, die du dir auch wirklich erarbeitet hast, schmecken noch viel geiler."" ""Heute war es sehr schwer für die Beine"", gab er im Rückblick auf das Saint-Gilles-Spiel zu, ""deswegen umso mehr ein Kompliment für die Mannschaft, für die Arbeit.""\nDurch den Sieg beim direkten Konkurrenten verteidigt die Werkself Platz sechs, hat nur noch vier Punkte Rückstand auf den Fünften aus Leipzig - und auch Champions-League-Platz vier (sechs Punkte entfernt) noch nicht gänzlich abgeschrieben. ""Wir machen weiter, wir sind nicht zufrieden. Es liegen noch sehr interessante Spiele vor uns und da gehen wir mit sehr viel Energie ran"", versprach Tah, Trainer Xabi Alonso pflichtete ihm bei: ""Noch fünf Bundesligaspiele, alles kann passieren, wir werden sehen.""\n""Wir haben gekämpft, wir haben zusammen verteidigt, wir hatten den Spirit. Ich bin sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft"", kam der Spanier ins Schwärmen. ""Wenn man nicht gut spielt, muss man bereit sein zu kämpfen und zu leiden. Die Mannschaft war bereit dafür. Es war vielleicht nicht unser bestes Spiel, aber die drei Punkte sind das Wichtigste für uns. Jetzt haben wir etwas Zeit, um uns zu erholen.""

Bevor es die Fußballer von Bayer Leverkusen im Europa-League-Halbfinale demnächst mit AS Rom zu tun bekommen im Kampf ums Finale und um ein goldenes Ticket für die Champions League, müssen sie in der Bundesliga erst noch alles dafür tun, den Kontakt zu den Top-Vier herzustellen.

Auch sie haben zwar noch einen Zweitwettbewerb in petto - sie spielen am 2. Mai ein DFB-Pokal-Halbfinale beim SC Freiburg -, allerdings geht es im Pokal nicht um eine Karte für die Champions League, nur für die Europa League. Das wäre den Leipzigern zu wenig. Umso bedeutsamer sind die nächsten Spiele in der Bundesliga. Am Samstag empfangen sie die TSG\xa0Hoffenheim.\nDie Leverkusener, mit zwölf Pflichtspielen ohne Niederlage als derzeit formstärkstes Team der Liga in dieses Duell gegangen, mussten auf ihren wichtigsten Mittelfeldspieler Florian Wirtz verzichten. Der 19-Jährige saß mit Magen-Darm-Verstimmung immerhin auf der Tribüne, sah von dort aber zunächst eine aktivere Leipziger Mannschaft. Deren Trainer Marco Rose hatte kurz vor dem Spiel bei Dazn verraten, dass man ""Chancen im Rücken von Jeremie Frimpong"" suchen werde. Frimpong ist Bayers supertorgefährlicher Rechtsaußenstürmerverteidiger, der vom niederländischen Nationaltrainer Ronald Koeman wegen Defensivschwächen aber ignoriert wird. Koeman sieht in ihm irgendwie gar keinen\xa0Abwehrmann.\nDie Leipziger fanden trotz weitgehender Überlegenheit keine Chancen im Rücken von Frimpong. Stattdessen platzierte Leverkusens Piero Hincapié nach 30 Minuten einen trockenen 30-Meter-Lattenschuss als Warnung, ehe Adam Hlozek in der 40. Minute die 1:0-Führung für die Gastgeber erzielte. Der Angriff war über rechts erfolgt, über die Seite von Frimpong und Moussa Diaby, der auch die Vorlage zum Treffer gab. Im Rücken von Frimpong jubelten die Leverkusener\xa0Abwehrspieler.\nBei Leipzig kam nach der Pause Christopher Nkunku für Kevin Kampl. Das sächsische Spiel benötigte im rheinischen Dauerregen mehr Vertikalität. Dies erschwerten ihnen die Leverkusener allerdings dadurch, dass sie sich sehr weit zurückzogen. So gingen die Leipziger Bälle horizontal von links nach rechts und zurück. Chancen ergaben sich trotzdem, etwa durch Standards, das Eckenverhältnis lautete am Ende 9:0 für Leipzig. Allein, ein Tor blieb ihnen\xa0versagt.\nAusgerechnet Frimpong, mit breiter Brust statt anfälligem Rücken, entschied die Partie fünf Minuten vor Schluss für Leverkusen. Seinen Konter beendete Leipzigs Dominik Szoboszlai im Strafraum per Foul, was ihm die gelb-rote Karte einbrachte und Bayer einen Elfmeter, den Nadiem Amiri in der 86. Minute zum 2:0 einschoss.

Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz fehlte nach Vereinsangaben wegen Magen-Darm-Problemen und saß mit blau-weißer Basecap auf der Tribüne. Abwehrspieler Edmond Tapsoba wurde wegen muskulärer Probleme als Vorsichtsmaßnahme geschont, der argentinische Weltmeister Exquiel Palacios wurde nicht rechtzeitig fit.\nDie Leipziger, denen Nationalspieler David Raum wegen einer Gelbsperre fehlte, waren zunächst die frischere und aktivere Mannschaft. Timo Werner hatte in der sechsten Minute aus spitzem Winkel schon die Führung auf dem Fuß, schoss Bayer-Keeper Lukas Hradecky aber gegen den Brustkorb.\nDie Leverkusener, die in den vergangenen Wochen ihr Offensivspiel mehr aus einer kompakten Defensive aufzogen, standen diesmal noch tiefer. Doch dann bekamen sie plötzlich die Konterchance schlechthin, als Mitchel Bakker, Kerem Demirbay und Moussa Diaby nach einem Leipziger Eckball zu dritt gegen einen aufs Tor zuliefen und den Ball vertändelten (28.). Piero Hincapiés Fernschuss aus 30 Metern unterschätzte Torwart Janis Blaswich, sodass der Ball gegen die Latte klatschte (32.).\nLeverkusen lauert und entscheidet spät\nLeipzig hatte im ersten Durchgang über 60 Prozent Ballbesitz und nominell deutlich mehr Torschüsse. Doch die besseren Chancen hatte Leverkusen und die vierte nutzten die Rheinländer dann, als Hlozek eine scharfe Hereingabe von Diaby aus zehn Metern zu seinem fünften Saisontor einschob.\nLeipzigs Trainer Marco Rose brachte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku. Deutschlands Fußballer des Jahres hatte nach einem Außenbandriss in der Vorwoche ein 16-minütiges Comeback gegeben. Leipzigs Spiel wurde zwar nur etwas zielstrebiger, doch nun gab es wenigstens Chancen. Vor allem eben durch Nkunku, dem Tah nach einer Parade von Hradecky den Ball in letzter Sekunde vor den Füßen wegschlug (66.). Kurz darauf parierte Hradecky den Kopfball von Willi Orban nach einem Eckball (68.).

Gute Gründe für ein paar Überlegungen in diese Richtung hat er angesichts der Entwicklungen im Meisterkampf aber zweifellos gehabt, und dass der Trainer von RB Leipzig am Sonntag ziemlich viel über Fußball nachdachte, war nicht zu übersehen, während der 0:2-Niederlage bei Bayer Leverkusen.\nImmer wieder stand Rose in Denkerpose in seiner Coachingzone, kraulte seinen Bart und fand doch keine Lösung gegen das Team seines derzeit erfolgreichen Kollegen Xabi Alonso, der noch auf den Gewinn der Europa League hoffen kann. Mit einer ebenso schlauen wie pragmatischen Spielweise haben die Leverkusener durch Tore von Adam Hlozek und Nadiem Amiri Leipzig besiegt.\nGut 25 Minuten war praktisch nichts passiert in dieser Partie, die als eine Art Spitzenspiel um die Teilnahme an der kommenden Champions-League-Saison betrachtet werden konnte.\xa0Leverkusen\xa0wirkte matt. Und Leipzig ist in diesem Frühjahr einfach unzuverlässig, schwer berechenbar und ineffizient.\nDas Spiel floss in etlichen Phasen ruhig vor sich hin. Bis die etwas intensivere Schlussphase begann, passierte abgesehen von einzelnen Momenten nicht sehr viel. Früh im Spiel vergeudete die Werkself eine tolle Vier-gegen-Einen-Konterchance, weil Mitchell Bakker ins Abseits gelaufen war, und vor dem Leverkusener Tor kam Dominik Szoboszlai zu einem Torabschluss aus guter Position, schoss jedoch nicht platziert genug (30.). Unter der Abwesenheit von Florian Wirtz litt scheinbar nicht nur die Werkself, sondern das gesamte Spielniveau.\nDer Nationalspieler saß aufgrund eines Magen-Darm-Infektes auf der Tribüne, von wo er dann nach 40 Minuten die Führung für sein Team bejubeln konnte. Robert Andrich hatte einen exzellenten Pass in die Tiefe auf Moussa Diaby gespielt, der den Ball in den Rücken der Abwehr weiterleitete, von wo Hlozek aus elf Metern zum 1:0 traf. Das war eine verdiente Führung in einer Partie, in die Leipzig eine Stunde lang viel zu wenig investierte, angesichts der Ausgangslage.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nAlle Infos und Themen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tF.A.Z.-Sonderseite zu Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlle Teams im Überblick\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie aktuelle Tabelle der Fußball-Bundesliga\nAlles in der Übersicht\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpielplan der Bundesliga: Termine, Ergebnisse, Partien\nAm Nachmittag hatte Freiburg die Sachsen in der Tabelle überholt, womit RB aus den Champions-League-Plätzen herausgerutscht war.

Minute Leverkusens Torhüter Lukas Hradecky zunächst gegen Timo Werner rettete und anschließend einen gefährlichen Kopfball von Willi Orban hielt. Das war nicht gefährlich genug, und die Leverkusener Gegenangriffe stoppten die Leipziger immer wieder mit Fouls. Allerdings war Szobozslai so ungeschickt, dieses Mittel im eigenen Strafraum gegen Jeremie Frimpong einzusetzen.

RB-Trainer Marco Rose ärgerte sich dagegen: ""Das war das x-te Spiel diese Saison, was wir einfach nicht verlieren dürfen.""\nDer bisherige Tabellen-Vierte Leipzig rutschte durch die schon achte Saison-Niederlage aus den Champions-League-Rängen und belegt nun direkt vor Bayer Platz fünf. Adam Hlozek (40. Minute) und Nadiem Amiri per Foulelfmeter (86.) erzielten Leverkusens Tore.

""Das ist so ein Muster, was uns Punkte kostet. Wir sind nicht effektiv genug.""\nBei Bayer standen gleich drei der wichtigsten Leistungsträger der vergangenen Wochen gar nicht im Kader. Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz fehlte nach Vereinsangaben wegen Magen-Darm-Problemen und saß mit blau-weißer Basecap auf der Tribüne. Abwehrspieler Edmond Tapsoba wurde wegen muskulärer Probleme als Vorsichtsmaßnahme geschont, der argentinische Weltmeister Exquiel Palacios wurde nicht rechtzeitig fit.\nDie Leipziger, denen Nationalspieler David Raum wegen einer Gelbsperre fehlte, waren zunächst die frischere und aktivere Mannschaft. Timo Werner hatte in der sechsten Minute aus spitzem Winkel schon die Führung auf dem Fuß, schoss Bayer-Keeper Lukas Hradecky aber gegen den Brustkorb.\nDie Leverkusener, die in den vergangenen Wochen ihr Offensivspiel mehr aus einer kompakten Defensive aufzogen, standen diesmal noch tiefer. Doch dann bekamen sie plötzlich die Konterchance schlechthin, als Mitchel Bakker, Kerem Demirbay und Moussa Diaby nach einem Leipziger Eckball zu dritt gegen einen aufs Tor zuliefen und den Ball vertändelten (28.). Piero Hincapiés Fernschuss aus 30 Metern unterschätzte Torwart Janis Blaswich, sodass der Ball gegen die Latte klatschte (32.).\nLeverkusen lauert und entscheidet spät\nLeipzig hatte im ersten Durchgang über 60 Prozent Ballbesitz und nominell deutlich mehr Torschüsse. Doch die besseren Chancen hatte Leverkusen und die vierte nutzten die Rheinländer dann, als Hlozek eine scharfe Hereingabe von Diaby aus zehn Metern zu seinem fünften Saisontor einschob.\nLeipzigs Trainer Marco Rose brachte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku. Deutschlands Fußballer des Jahres hatte nach einem Außenbandriss in der Vorwoche ein 16-minütiges Comeback gegeben. Leipzigs Spiel wurde zwar nur etwas zielstrebiger, doch nun gab es wenigstens Chancen. Vor allem eben durch Nkunku, dem Tah nach einer Parade von Hradecky den Ball in letzter Sekunde vor den Füßen wegschlug (66.). Kurz darauf parierte Hradecky den Kopfball von Willi Orban nach einem Eckball (68.).

"{'content': 'Timo Werner und seine Leipziger kassierten in Leverkusen einen Rückschlag im Kampf um einen Platz in der Champions League.\n(Foto: IMAGO/Nordphoto)\nIm Europacup ist Bayer Leverkusen der einzige Bundesligist im Halbfinale. Und in der Liga rollt die Werkself weiter das Feld von hinten auf. Leipzig rutscht derweil aus den Champions-League-Rängen. Pechvogel bei den anrennenden Gästen ist DFB-Stürmer Timo Werner.\nHöhenflug in Europa, Aufholjagd in der Liga: Die Titeljäger von Bayer Leverkusen haben ihren beeindruckenden Lauf auch gegen RB Leipzig fortgesetzt. Drei Tage nach dem Sprung ins Europa-League-Halbfinale schlug die gnadenlos effektive Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso den DFB-Pokalsieger 2:0 (1:0) und nahm vorsichtig die Champions-League-Plätze ins Visier. ""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft. Wir haben wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt"", sagte Jonathan Tah bei DAZN: ""Wir machen immer weiter und sind nicht zufrieden.""\nAdam Hlozek (40.) und Nadiem Amiri (86., Foulelfmeter) erzielten vor 29.085 Zuschauern die Tore für die Leverkusener, die auch ohne Florian Wirtz im achten Ligaspiel in Folge ungeschlagen blieben. Die Leipziger, die im siebten Auswärtsspiel erstmals bei Bayer verloren und das Spiel nach einer Gelb-Roten Karte gegen Dominik Szoboszlai (85.) zu zehnt beendeten, sind nur noch vier Punkte entfernt und rutschten nach dem 29. Spieltag aus den Königsklassen-Plätzen. Bayer lauert unmittelbar dahinter als Sechster. ""Wir haben nicht schlecht gespielt, aber das bringt uns nichts - wir haben es nicht konsequent genug zu Ende gespielt"", sagte Leipzigs Benjamin Henrichs. Diese fehlende Konsequenz ""kostet uns Punkte"".\nNach dem Einzug ins erste Europapokal-Halbfinale seit 21 Jahren am Donnerstag wechselte Alonso dreimal - zweimal davon zwangsweise: Der formstarke Wirtz fehlte am späten Sonntagnachmittag wegen Magen-Darm-Beschwerden ebenso wie Edmond Tapsoba, der aufgrund von muskulären Problemen aussetzen musste.\nGegen Angstgegner Leipzig, der vor dem Duell nur zwei von 13 Pflichtspielen gegen die Rheinländer verloren hatte, agierten die Leverkusener anfangs deutlich passiver als noch unter der Woche bei Union Saint-Gilloise (4:1). Die Anfangsphase gehörte den Gästen: Timo Werner, Doppelpacker beim 3:2 gegen den FC Augsburg, testete Bayer-Torwart Lukas Hradecky erstmals (6.).\nLeverkusen streute immer wieder ungewohnte Fehlpässe und technische Fehler im Spielaufbau ein. Leipzig konnte die Ballgewinne aber zunächst nicht in gezielte Angriffe ummünzen. Das Spiel verflachte in der Folge: Bayer überließ RB meist den Ball und lauerte auf Konter - spielte die wenigen Umschaltaktionen aber anfangs zu ungenau aus. Aus dem Nichts sorgte Piero Hincapie (32.) mit einem Lattentreffer aus rund 30 Metern für die beste Bayer-Szene bis dahin, Leverkusen war nun aktiver und belohnte sich: Hlozek vollendete einen Konter nach einer scharfen Hereingabe von Moussa Diaby technisch stark mit links.\nDie Führung kam zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend und bescherte Bayer gleichwohl Sicherheit. Leipzig, mit drei Pflichtspielsiegen in Folge ins Rheinland gereist, schien beeindruckt. Wirtz verfolgte auf der Tribüne bei starkem Regen, wie Bayer die Führung mit zunehmender Spieldauer nur noch verwaltete. Rose hatte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku, der nach seinem Muskelfaserriss das zweite Spiel bestritt, für Kevin Kampl gebracht und damit offensiv gewechselt.\nNkunku (62.) leitete mit seinem Abschluss die beste Leipziger Phase ein. Die müde wirkenden Leverkusener beschränkten sich nur noch aufs Verteidigen und gingen damit ins Risiko. Werner (66.) vergab eine Riesenchance gegen Hradecky. RB rannte weiter an - war dabei aber anfällig für Konter. Die Sachsen belohnten sich für ihre klare Überlegenheit. Szoboszlai brachte bei einem solchen Leverkusener Angriff Jeremie Frimpong zu Fall und musste vom Feld. Amiri verwandelte vom Elfmeterpunkt.\nQuelle: ntv.de, tno/sid'}",Jonathan Tah,de

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nXabi Alonso macht Leverkusen besser - und lernt zugleich als Trainernovize viel dazu.\nLeverkusen erreicht erstmals seit 21 Jahren ein Europapokal-Halbfinale. Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso - auch, weil er erfolgreich gegen Leverkusener Sitten ansteuert.\nVon Philipp Selldorf, Leverkusen\nNach dem Coup im Lotto-Stadion in Anderlecht wurde im inneren Zirkel Bayer Leverkusens vor allem über die angemessene Zuteilung von Siegerbieren diskutiert. Der Torwart Lukas Hradecky nahm seine Kapitänspflichten gewissenhaft wahr und eröffnete die Debatte. Üblicherweise informiert er nach gewonnenen Spielen in eigener Sache, er werde sich abends ""ein, zwei Bierchen"" gönnen, diesmal aber ging er als Teamsprecher im Stil eines Lokomotivführer-Gewerkschafters in die Tarifverhandlungen: ""Ich glaube, fünf Bier sind erlaubt"", sagte er mit Blick auf die dreistündige Busreise ins Rheinland. Simon Rolfes, der Vertreter der Arbeitgeberseite, deutete Entgegenkommen an (""das eine oder andere geht schon""), wies aber auch auf gebotene Grenzen hin: ""Das Fußballer-Leben ist\xa0hart.""\nRB Leipzig, am Sonntag der nächste Bundesliga-Gegner, darf sich womöglich freuen: Euphorisierte Leverkusener Profifußballer sind traditionell gern bereit, beim nächsten Pflichttermin etwas weniger diensteifrig aufzutreten. Bei dieser Mannschaft und diesem Trainer weiß man allerdings nicht, ob überlieferte Sitten noch gelten. Zwar erzählt man sich am Rhein, Disziplin sei nicht die hervorragende Eigenschaft des aktuellen Bayer-Kaders, zugleich versichern die Bayer-Verantwortlichen jedoch, Trainer Xabi Alonso sei ein Mann, dem Disziplin und hausinterne Regeltreue viel bedeuteten. Es sieht so aus, als ob er sich damit durchsetzen\xa0würde.\nDer Spanier Xabi Alonso spricht über seinen Weg vom Bayern-Profi ins Traineramt in Leverkusen, Gemeinsamkeiten von Florian Wirtz und Lionel Messi - und erklärt, was das Spiel wirklich mit Mathematik verbindet.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Interview von Javier Cáceres\nBeim Europacup-Rückspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise obsiegte eindeutig die Linie des spanischen Trainers. Leverkusens 4:1-Sieg drückte nicht nur eine konzentrierte Leistung aus, er sah auch nach dem Triumph einer Mannschaft aus, die mit einer klaren Strategie ins Spiel gegangen war. Als Alonso nach dem 1:1 gegen eine abgezockte Union-Elf im Hinspiel vor einer Woche in aller Gelassenheit betonte, Bayer sei ""bereit"" und ""gut vorbereitet"" für die zweite Folge, klang das verdächtig vielsagend. Nun führte die Mannschaft vor, dass der Trainer für die beiden Viertelfinal-Spiele einen kombinierten Plan entworfen\xa0hatte.\nDass sein Team schon nach 67 Sekunden unter glücklichen Umständen in Führung gehen würde - Torschütze Moussa Diaby erhielt die Vorlage von Gegnerseite -, konnte zwar selbst der Fußballweise Alonso nicht voraussehen. Doch schon in der ersten Minute wurde die Leverkusener Spielanlage sichtbar, die von offensiven Rollenwechseln und einem stabilen defensiven Fundament geprägt war. Diaby, Florian Wirtz, Adam Hlozek und Jeremie Frimpong teilten sich die Räume nach Bedarf und Belieben. Auf der linken Seite marschierte derweil Mitchel Bakker auf und nieder, dass Hradecky an ein anatomisches Wunder glaubte: ""Ich weiß nicht, wie viele Lungen der Mann hat, wahrscheinlich mehr als\xa0zwei.""\nDem niederländischen Linksverteidiger Bakker, 22, wird nachgesagt, er verstehe es, innerhalb von zwei Szenen eines Fußballspiels sowohl Welt- als auch Kreisklasse zu verkörpern. Ferner ist er berüchtigt für häufiges Zuspätkommen, was ihn außer einigen Euro auch Einsätze bei Punktspielen gekostet hat. Zuletzt ist aber eine gewisse Regelmäßigkeit in seinen Arbeitszeiten eingekehrt, was auch für Bakkers Auftreten im Spiel gilt. Wild ist es hin und wieder immer noch, aber nicht mehr wüst wie früher. Beim Treffer zum 2:0 (37.) blieb Bakker cool und vollendete damit einen meisterlich ausgespielten Gegenangriff über Wirtz, Diaby und Flankengeber Hlozek. Am 3:0 (60.) hatte er seinen Anteil, als er dem zögerlichen Union-Torwart Anthony Moris so sehr zusetzte, dass dieser den Ball für Frimpong geradewegs zum Einschuss\xa0bereitlegte.\n21 Jahre sind vergangen, seit Bayer 04 das letzte Mal im Halbfinale eines Eurocups gestanden hat, es war die Saison, in der sich das Team um Ballack, Lucio, Bastürk und Berbatov als dreimaliger Vize unselig verewigte: in der Meisterschaft, im Pokal und in der Champions League. Kurioserweise hieß es vor dieser Saison, der aktuelle Bayer-Kader sei dank hochkarätiger Besetzung am ehesten geeignet, mit dem Ensemble von damals zu konkurrieren. Unselig geriet aber auch dessen Mission zunächst, und die ersten Amtshandlungen des im Herbst anstelle von Gerardo Seoane eingesetzten Trainers Alonso wollten ebenfalls nicht gleich\xa0glücken.\nInzwischen jedoch hat er Spieler wie Bakker neu erfunden, andere Spieler wiederentdeckt, die schon unauffindbar im Kader verloren gegangen waren (Exequiel Palacios, Nadiem Amiri), und wieder andere Spieler auf selten erreichtes Niveau getrimmt (Verteidiger Jonathan Tah). Der Ruf des Trainers Alonso nähert sich nun dem Rang des Spielers Alonso. Leverkusens ""semifinalwürdige Leistung"" (Hradecky) in Brüssel wird weiter dazu\xa0beitragen.\nGerüchte darüber, dass ihn Real Madrids Patron Florentino Pérez als Nachfolger für Carlo Ancelotti herbeiwünscht - womöglich schon im Sommer -, sind auch den Bayer-Oberen bekannt und werden von ihnen nicht für unglaubwürdig gehalten. Sie verweisen jedoch gelassen auf seine Vertragsdauer (bis 2024) und auf Alonsos Klugheit. Als Trainer-Neuling hat er in Leverkusen schon viel gelernt, aber er wird noch viel mehr dazulernen können. Das Treffen mit der AS Rom im Halbfinale bietet dazu die beste Gelegenheit, dann bekommt er es mit dem alten Meistermacher José Mourinho zu\xa0tun.\nDer spektakuläre Trainerwechsel hat bei den Bayern die Saison nicht gerettet und bereits jetzt Thomas Tuchel beschädigt. Dennoch fehlt die Fantasie, dass jemand dafür Verantwortung übernehmen muss - wenn doch, würde es spannend.\nLesen Sie mehr zum Thema\nIn anspruchsvollen Berufsfeldern im Stellenmarkt der SZ.\nSie möchten die digitalen Produkte der SZ mit uns weiterentwickeln?

Er war auch mal Spieler“, sagte Hradecky auf die Frage nach dem erlaubten Bierkonsum: „Jeder muss wissen, wie viel er trinken kann. Aber fünf sind sicher erlaubt.“\nAlonso, der das Team im Oktober als Vorletzter der Bundesliga übernahm und nun zwölf Pflichtspiele in Folge nicht verlor, sprach noch nicht über das Endspiel. „Jetzt haben wir noch eine Reise vor uns. Wohin sie uns führt, werden wir sehen“, sagte er. „Aber diese Chance ist super.“ Kurios: Alonso, als Spieler Weltmeister, zweimal Europameister und zweimal Champions-League-Sieger, hat die Europa League als Profi nicht nur nie gewonnen. Er hat auch nie nur ein einziges Spiel dort absolviert.\nDoch er hat seinen Profis die Einstellung für diesen Wettbewerb eingepflanzt. Und fast alle Spieler besser gemacht. Wie Mitchell Bakker, der am Donnerstag der überragende Spieler war. „Ich weiß nicht, wie viele Lungen der Mann hat“, sagte Hradecky. „Aber sicher drei oder vier.“\nJetzt haben wir noch eine Reise vor uns. Diese Chance ist super.\nDer Torhüter dachte auch an Alonsos Vorgänger Gerardo Seoane, denn „es tut mir immer noch leid, dass Gerardo gehen musste. Aber ich habe vorhin zu Jona gesagt: Spul mal sechs Monate zurück, wo wir da waren und welche Entwicklung die Mannschaft genommen hat.“ Das sei auch das Verdienst von Alonso: „Es ist nicht nur der Trainer. Aber Xabi hat einen sehr guten Job gemacht.“\nIm Halbfinale kommt es nun zum Duell mit Mourinho, einem seiner Lehrmeister in Alonsos Spielerzeit bei Real Madrid. Und auch für DFB-Sportdirektor Rudi Völler, der bis vergangenen Sommer Sportchef bei Bayer war und immer noch bei fast jedem Spiel auf der Tribüne sitzt, wird es ein besonderes Duell. Seit seinen fünf Jahren bei der Roma bezeichnet sich Völler als „halber Römer“.\nDie Belgier waren jedenfalls schwer beeindruckt von den Leverkusenern. „Das war allerhöchstes Niveau“, schwärmte Kapitän Teddy Teuma. „Zu präzise, zu schnell und zu stark“ sei der Bundesligist gewesen, schrieb „La Dernière Heure“. Und die Zeitung „Le Soir“ stellte fest: „Union verlässt Europa mit einer Ohrfeige.“ So ist Bayers dritter Titel der Vereinsgeschichte nach dem UEFA-Cup-Triumph 1988 und dem DFB-Pokalsieg 1993 möglich.\nZur Startseite\nöffnet in neuem Tab oder Fenster""}",Jonathan Tah,de

Seitdem Xabi Alonso Bayer 04 Anfang Oktober auf dem 17. Tabellenplatz übernommen hat, hat der Spanier die Mannschaft in einem schmerzhaften und nicht an Rückschlägen armen Umerziehungsprozess von einem wilden Haufen hochbegabter, aber genauso taktisch undisziplinierter Künstler zu einem Kollektiv geformt, das immer mehr die Konturen einer echten Spitzenmannschaft annimmt.\n""Es sind nur sechs, sieben Monate, aber es ist viel passiert. Am Anfang war es nicht einfach, aber es ist immer eine Entwicklung. Wir sind zufrieden, dass wir diese Stimmung verändern konnten und jetzt in dieser Position sind in der Bundesliga und in Europa"", resümierte Leverkusens Trainer später in den Katakomben der altehrwürdigen Arena.\nWobei er den größten Fortschritt der Kicker des Tabellensechsten zwischen den Ohren bewirkt hat. ""Wir haben geholfen, aber am meisten liegt es an den Spielern. Der Kopf muss stimmen. Ich habe immer gesagt, wir haben die Qualität, aber der Kopf ist wichtiger. Im Moment haben wir ein gutes Zusammenspiel zwischen Qualität und der Mentalität.  Dadurch haben wir es bis hierher geschafft"", erklärte der Spanier, um direkt deutlich zu machen, dass Anderlecht nur eine Zwischenstation gewesen sein soll, mit den Worten ""Und wir wollen mehr!"".\nNicht nur für einen Titelsammler wie Xabi Alonso kann dies einzig bedeuten, die Europa League zu gewinnen. ""Jetzt haben wir noch eine Reise. Wir werden sehen, wohin sie geht"", philosophierte der 41-Jährige und meinte damit sicher nicht nur den nächsten Gegner, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch in Rom in der Verlängerung zwischen der AS und Feyenoord Rotterdam\xa0(4:1 für Rom n.V.) ermittelt wurde. Der insgesamt erwachsene Auftritt in Belgien, bei dem Bayer einzig in der Viertelstunde nach dem 1:3 der Gastgeber ins Wanken geriet, deklariert den Bundesligisten als Titelanwärter.\nDer Wandel der Werkself unter Xabi Alonso ist mittlerweile unverkennbar. Und der Reifegrad dieser Mannschaft wurde in den 90 Minuten in Anderlecht gerade darin offenkundig, dass es eine Leistung der Leverkusener war, die über Jahre als völlig untypisch eingeordnet worden wäre. So präsentierte sich das Team in der Defensive mit einem überragenden Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah über eine Stunde lang so stabil, dass die keineswegs enttäuschenden Belgier bis dahin zu keiner ernsthaften Chance kamen. Erst als Xabi Alonso den starken Edmond Tapsoba aufgrund muskulärer Probleme in der Dreierkette durch Odilon Kossounou ersetzen musste, geriet der Bundesligist zwischenzeitlich in Bedrängnis.\nUmgekehrt zeigte sich Bayer, über Jahre der Inbegriff für Chancenwucher, bis auf die Endphase in der Offensive brutal effizient. Wobei man bei aller Euphorie im Leverkusener Lager anmerken muss, dass Saint-Gilles mit groben Aussetzern beim ersten und dritten Treffer der Werkself extrem in die Karten spielte.\nDass sich mit Mitchel Bakker zur Krönung des Unerwarteten ein Problemprofi zum herausragenden Akteur dieser Partie aufschwang, war die Pointe dieser phantastischen Reise, die Bayer unter Xabi Alonso im Zeitraffer absolviert hat. Der niederländische linke Schienenspieler, der in dieser Saison lang nur durch sportliche wie disziplinarische Aussetzer aufgefallen war, erzielte nicht nur das 2:0, provozierte nicht nur durch sein energisches Nachsetzen gegen Union-Keeper Anthony Moris dessen Fehlpass auf Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong vor dem 3:0 und setzte nicht nur mit einem feinen Zuspiel Moussa Diaby mit dem vorletzten Pass beim 4:1 durch Adam Hlozek in Szene, sondern präsentierte sich auch spielerisch ansprechend, defensiv solide sowie extrem einsatzfreudig.\nNicht umsonst stellte Kapitän Lukas Hradecky auf das ganze Team und speziell auf Bakker, der vor wenigen Wochen noch aus dem Spieltagsaufgebot gegen Hertha BSC gestrichen worden war, weil er das Abschusstraining verpennt hatte, fest: ""Alle kleinen Dinge kommen zusammen. Er hat richtig reagiert auf seine Suspendierung. Heute hatte er drei oder vier Lungen. Wie viel er läuft und was er momentan für die Mannschaft tut, ist großartig. Heute war das nicht Europa-League-Niveau, sondern Champions-League-Niveau von ihm.""\nKomplettiert wurde die These, dass Bayer eine Spitzenmannschaft wird, von der Bedeutung von Florian Wirtz in dieser Partie. Lautete die Gleichung bislang: Nur wenn Wirtz stark ist, ist auch Bayer stark, so wurde auch dieses scheinbare Naturgesetz am Donnerstag außer Kraft gesetzt. So war Leverkusens Genie mal eben nicht die spielentscheidende Figur, erlaubte sich bei aller spielerischer Klasse auf engstem Raum und wichtigen Pässen, um dem belgischen Pressing zu entgehen, auch ungewohnte Ballverluste, wie den vor dem 1:3. Dass der Werksklub trotzdem so überzeugend auftrat, ist das letzte, aber vielleicht auch klarste Indiz dafür, dass Xabi Alonsos Arbeit zu etwas Großem führen kann.\nDer Trainer jedenfalls möchte in dem bisher Geleisteten trotz eines positiven Zwischenfazits nur einen Anfang sehen. ""Ich habe vom ersten Tag an gesagt, wenn wir fragil sind, wenn wir nicht wie eine Mannschaft zusammen verteidigen, dann ist das nicht möglich. Jetzt verteidigen wir gut, spielen kompakt und haben immer die Qualität, Chancen zu erspielen. Jetzt haben wir diese Entwicklung"", konstatierte Xabi Alonso, ""aber es ist zu früh, eine Saisonanalyse zu machen. Wir haben noch fünf, sechs Wochen, danach kann man noch besser analysieren."" Und noch viel mehr erreicht haben.\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jonathan Tah,de
"{'content': 'Rudi Völler fieberte den ganzen Abend sowohl mit Bayer Leverkusen als auch der AS Rom mit. Und als um 23.44 Uhr das Duell seiner beiden Herzensclubs im Halbfinale der Europa League perfekt war, musste der Sportdirektor des DFB erst mal schmunzeln. ""Das Unausweichliche ist passiert"", sagte Völler der Deutschen Presse-Agentur: ""Das werden ganz sicher zwei wunderbare Spiele.""\nDie Völler beide im Stadion erleben wird. Noch am Abend signalisierte er Bayer Leverkusens Club-Chef Fernando Carro und Simon Rolfes, seinem Nachfolger als Sportchef seit letztem Sommer, dass er auch mit zum Hinspiel bei der AS Rom am 11. Mai reisen wird.\nBei Leverkusens Heimspielen sitzt Völler, der sich seit seinen fünf Jahren als Roma-Stürmer von 1987 bis 1992 als ""halber Römer"" bezeichnet, eh meist auf der Tribüne. So auch beim 1:1 im Viertelfinal-Hinspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise an seinem 63. Geburtstag.\n""Zwei 50:50-Spiele""\nUnd seine Sympathien werden klar verteilt sein. ""Bei all meiner Nähe zu Rom ist klar, dass mein Herz für Bayer Leverkusen schlägt"", sagte er: ""Das ist mein Club, bei dem ich nach meiner DFB-Zeit auch wieder in den Aufsichtsrat zurückgehen werde."" Die Partien gegen Rom seien ""zwei 50:50-Spiele, bei denen die Tagesform entscheiden wird"". Trainer José Mourinho habe bei der Roma ""große Euphorie entfacht"".\nDoch die starke Leistung der Leverkusener beim 4:1 im Rückspiel macht Völler Mut, dass Bayer den ersten Titel seit dem Gewinn DFB-Pokals 1993 gewinnen kann. ""Wir haben es einfach auch verdient, mal wieder einen Titel zu gewinnen"", sagte er - und nutzte bewusst noch das Wort ""wir"". ""Vor drei Jahren waren wir im Viertelfinale und sind leider an Inter Mailand gescheitert"", sagte der Weltmeister von 1990, der fast drei Jahrzehnte für Bayer arbeitete: ""Jetzt hast du diesen Lauf, die Mannschaft hat ja schon in den letzten Wochen wunderbaren Fußball gespielt.""\nDeutschlands letzte Titel-Hoffnung\nUnd so ist Bayer nebenbei nach dem Aus des FC Bayern und der sechs anderen Bundesligisten in den drei Europacups Deutschlands letzte Titel-Hoffnung. Kapitän Lukas Hradecky sprach deshalb mit funkelnden Augen von einem ""geilen Abenteuer"". Und Rolfes hofft auf dem Weg zum Titel auf Unterstützung aller Clubs und Fans. ""Es muss uns niemand danken. Aber es wäre schön, wenn uns alle unterstützen"", sagte der Ex-Nationalspieler: ""Wir hoffen, dass national alle hinter uns stehen, damit wir auch die nächste Runde gewinnen.""\nNach Eintracht Frankfurt im Vorjahr kann also erneut ein deutscher Club in dem Wettbewerb triumphieren. Auf die Frage, wie real der Traum vom Titel sei, antwortete der seit Wochen überragende Abwehrchef Jonathan Tah knapp und selbstbewusst: ""Realer als aktuell geht\'s glaub\' ich nicht.""\nIn jedem Fall träumen die Leverkusener spätestens jetzt vom Endspiel am 31. Mai in Budapest. ""Das Ziel ist ganz klar, ins Finale zu kommen"", stellte Rolfes klar. Und Hradecky, mit 33 einer der Erfahrenen und schon EM-Teilnehmer und DFB-Pokalsieger mit Frankfurt, antwortete auf die Frage, wo er den bisherigen Erfolg in seiner Karriere einstufen würde, lachend: ""Frag mich in Budapest noch mal.""\n""Diese Chance ist super""\nErst einmal wurde der erste Halbfinal-Einzug in Europa seit 21 Jahren auf der dreistündigen Busfahrt nach Hause ausgiebig gefeiert.

"{'content': 'Party mit den Fans: Die Bayer-Profis Moussa Diaby (v.l.), Lukas Hradecky, Florian Wirtz, Karim Bellarabi, Piero Hincapie und Jonathan Tah\nHALBFINALE!\nBayer Leverkusen stürmte mit einem 4:1-Sieg über Royale Union Saint-Gilloise ins Semifinale der  Europa League.  Es war die beste Leistung der Werkself in dieser Saison.\nDie BILD-Einzelkritik zum Viertelfinal-Rückspiel.\nLukas Hradecky: In der ersten Hälfte nicht geprüft. Machtlos beim Gegentor seines finnischen Landsmannes Kasper Terho. Sensationeller Reflex in der 75. Minute mitten in der Drangphase der Belgier. Note 2.\nEdmond Tapsoba: Der Burkiner stand sehr sicher und schaltete sich immer wieder gut mit ins Aufbauspiel ein. Wegen leichter muskulärer Beschwerden musste er früh raus. Note 2.\nJonathan Tah: So stark, so sicher, so gut – seine körperliche Präsenz war – wie im Hinspiel – beeindruckend. Sein Traumpass auf Azmoun kurz vor Schluss wäre die Krönung auf eine erneut sensationelle Vorstellung des Abwehrchefs gewesen. Tah ist in dieser Verfassung ganz klar wieder ein DFB-Kandidat. Note 1.\nPiero Hincapie: Hielt seine linke Seite weitestgehend dicht. Der Ecuadorianer kassierte kurz vor der Pause einen üblen Tritt von Lazare Amani auf die Wade, der mit der Roten Karte hätte bestraft werden müssen. Note 2.\n\nVortänzer: Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong und seine Kollegen feiern den Halbfinal-Einzug\nJeremie Frimpong: Ob vorne oder hinten – Frimpong war überall gleichzeitig, reagierte cool und nutzte seine Chance zum 3:0. Note 2.\nRobert Andrich: Wieder ein starker Auftritt des „emotionalen Leaders“ der Werkself, der längst eine Nominierung in der Nationalelf verdient hätte. Bei ihm merkte man in jeder Sekunde an, wie viel Lust er auf diese Nacht hatte. Note 2.\nNadiem Amiri: Dass er anstelle des angeschlagenen Exequiel Palacios beginnen würde, überraschte viele – wohl auch die Belgier. In der Offensive wenig Akzente, dafür enormer Einsatz für die Mannschaft. Note 3.\nMitchel Bakker: Ein Monster-Spiel des Niederländers. Volley-Abnahme zum 2:0, dann setzte er Union-Keeper Moris derart unter Druck, dass dieser Frimpong den Ball zum 3:0 „auflegte“. Auch das 4:1 leitete Bakker ein. Mehr geht nicht – bester Auftritt im Bayer-Trikot. Weltklasse. Note 1.\nMoussa Diaby: Der Franzose schoss das schnellste Europa-League-Tor der Saison. Auch an der Entstehung des zweiten und vierten Treffers entscheidend beteiligt. Note 2.\n\nFlorian Wirtz springt Mitchel Bakker auf den Rücken vor Freude\nAdam Hlozek: Stand überraschend in der Startelf und zahlte dieses Vertrauen eindrucksvoll zurück mit einer Super-Flanke auf Bakker zum 2:0 und seinem Abstauber zum 4:1, der das Spiel endgültig entschied. Note 2.\nFlorian Wirtz: Sorgte direkt für Unruhe in Unions Abwehr, was zum 1:0 durch Diaby führte. Sein Pass auf Diaby leitete den Traumkonter zum 2:0 ein. Aber: Sein Ballverlust führte auch zum Anschlusstreffer der Belgier. Die entscheidenden Szenen hatten diesmal andere, wobei sein kämpferischer Einsatz herausragend war. Note 3.\nKerem Demirbay (ab 59./für Amiri): Wie in den letzten Wochen mit einer guten Leistung. Er sorgte nach seiner Hereinnahme vor allem dafür, dass Bayer in der Druckphase der Belgier wieder die Kontrolle fand. Note 2.\n\nStolz auf seine Sieger: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nOdilon Kossounou (ab 59./für Tapsoba): Der Ivorer musste für den angeschlagenen Tapsoba die rechte Abwehrseite übernehmen, hatte in der Drangphase der Belgier auch einige Probleme, arbeitete sich aber von Minute zu Minute besser ins Spiel. Note 3.\nAmine Adli (ab 71./für Frimpong): Am Ende reichte es beim Franzosen zumindest für einen Joker-Einsatz, hatte kurz vor Schluss eine gute Schusschance. Note 3.\nSardar Azmoun (ab 86./für Hlozek): Der Iraner hatte in der Nachspielzeit zwei gute Möglichkeiten, vergab jedoch beide. Ohne Note.\nKarim Bellarabi (ab 86./für Diaby): Auch der Fan-Liebling bekam seine Chance, scheitert aber frei vor Torwart Moris. Ohne Note.\nXabi Alonso: Seine Mannschaft gewann über eine starke Defensive und effektive Offensive das Spiel deutlich. Kluge Wechsel in den richtigen Momenten brachten die Belgier in ihrer Drangphase aus dem Konzept. Sein Team ist seit zwölf Pflichtspielen unbesiegt, Alonsos Anteil an dieser Stabilität ist enorm.

Doch der Finne, bekennender Freund eines Feier-Bieres, dachte eben auch schon an die Heimfahrt.

""Jeder muss wissen, wie viel er trinken kann"", mahnte er selbst zunächst in seiner Funktion als Kapitän: ""Aber fünf sind sicher erlaubt.""\nFür Hradecky hätten es laut Jonathan Tah noch einige mehr sein dürfen. ""Ich trinke nicht so viel Alkohol"", sagte der seit Wochen überragende Abwehrchef: ""Aber der Lukas kann gerne ein, zwei für mich mittrinken.""

Bayer könnte gleich zwei Ziele erreichen.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtm-b7nea\nSpätestens wenn die zweite Hälfte des Aprils anbricht, beginnt im Fußball immer auch die Zeit der historischen Bezüge. Weil Halbfinals und Endspiele nahen, werden Erinnerungen an unvergessene Siege, an verpasste Chancen und an große Mannschaften lebendig, auch in Leverkusen ist das nicht anders. Der rheinische Werksklub hat an diesem Donnerstagabend (21.00 Uhr im F.A.Z.-Liveticker zur Europa League und bei RTL) in Brüssel im Duell mit Union Saint-Gilloise die Chance, zum vierten Mal in seiner Klubgeschichte das Halbfinale eines Europapokals zu erreichen.\nZuletzt vollbrachte Bayer 04 dieses Kunststück 2002, als die Reise der legendären Mannschaft um Michael Ballack, Lucio und Bernd Schneider über den Kontinent bis ins Champions-League-Finale gegen Real Madrid führte. „Es ist natürlich eine Riesenmotivation, dass wir zum ersten Mal seit 2002 wieder in das Halbfinale eines Europapokals kommen können“, sagt Sportdirektor Simon Rolfes, entsprechend entschlossen wird das Projekt angegangen.\nObwohl es auch in der Bundesliga um viel geht, schont Trainer Xabi Alonso regelmäßig an den Wochenenden wichtige Spieler, um auf internationalem Terrain möglichst starke Leistungen wahrscheinlicher zu machen. Zuletzt folgte er dieser Strategie beim 0:0 in Wolfsburg am Sonntag. Dort saßen mit Jonathan Tah, Amine Adli, Mitchel Bakker und vor allem Florian Wirtz vier Spieler auf der Bank, die in den wirklich wichtigen Partien meist zur Startelf zählen.\nDiese finden derzeit eben in der Europa League statt. Schließlich können hier mit einem Gewinn des Titels gleich zwei Ziele auf einmal erreicht werden: ein Erfolg für die Fußball-Ewigkeit und die Qualifikation für die kommende Champions-League-Spielrunde, die von zentraler Bedeutung für die mittelfristige Entwicklung des Klubs ist. „Wir haben eine Superchance“, sagt Alonso zu den Aussichten nach dem 1:1 im Viertelfinalhinspiel gegen die Belgier.\nWährend der vergangenen Jahrzehnte wurde dieser Wettbewerb unterhalb der geradezu kultisch verehrten Champions League in Deutschland nicht immer mit der angemessenen Wertschätzung betrachtet. Erst der Titelgewinn von Eintracht Frankfurt im vergangenen Jahr und die Einsicht, dass auch hier wirklich große Europapokalabende möglich sind, hat das Ansehen des Wettbewerbs grundlegend verändert.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nLeverkusen-Gegner Saint-Gilloise\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoker-Milliardär spielt „Moneyball“\nTrainer von Bayer Leverkusen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie beeindruckende Souveränität des Xabi Alonso\n0:0 in Wolfsburg\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBundesliga-Siegesserie der Leverkusener ist gerissen\nBayer Leverkusen\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t„Ein Halbfinale gibt es nicht for free“\nUnd weil die Bedeutung der Europa League in der spanischen Heimat des Leverkusener Trainers Alonso schon viel früher erkannt worden ist, könnte sich nun eine interessante Kombination ergeben: In Leverkusen blüht die Hoffnung auf den zweiten europäischen Titel seit dem Erfolg im UEFA-Cup 1988, und der Trainer vermittelt die passende Haltung. „Jetzt Vollgas“, sagt Alonso mit Blick auf das Rückspiel gegen die zähen Belgier, die der Werkself in Leverkusen ein 1:1 abtrotzten. Die Zuversicht im Team ist groß, auch weil im Fußball das gern beschworene Momentum für den letzten Bundesligaklub im Wettbewerb spricht.\nNach dem schwachen Saisonstart gehören die Leverkusener zu den stärksten Teams in Deutschland, der Trainer ist endgültig im Klub angekommen, und Moussa Diaby sagt: „Bayer 04 hat die Spieler, um die Europa League zu gewinnen.“ Zudem ist Alonso, der zweimal die Champions League sowie die Weltmeisterschaft und ebenfalls zweimal die Europameisterschaft gewann, gut vertraut mit den Mechanismen sehr großer Spiele.\nUnd Wirtz, von dem die meisten Experten glauben, er habe eine Weltkarriere vor sich, kann jederzeit praktisch aus dem Nichts entscheidende Situationen hervorzaubern. So wie im Hinspiel gegen Saint-Gilloise, als er mit einem prachtvollen Schuss zum 1:1 traf. Es war schon sein siebtes Tor in der Europa League, seit dem großen Brasilianer Ronaldo Mitte der 1990er-Jahre hat kein Teenager mehr so viele Tore in diesem Wettbewerb geschossen. Was noch fehlt, sind allerdings die rauschhaften Europapokalabende, die die Würze einer großen Saison sind.\nWährend der SC Freiburg gegen Juventus Turin und Union Berlin gegen Ajax Amsterdam gespielt und eine tolle Gruppenphase erlebt haben, stolperte Bayer 04 im Herbst durch die Champions League. Das bisherige Leverkusener Highlight war der Sieg im Elfmeterschießen bei der AS Monaco, im atmosphärisch eher trostlosen Stadion Louis II an der Côte d’Azur, wo nur 8504 Zuschauer zugegen waren.\nWas den Erlebniswert betrifft, gibt es also noch Nachholbedarf. Sollte Bayer Leverkusen nun allerdings im Brüsseler Stadtteil Anderlecht die nächste Runde erreichen, wäre ein besonderes Erlebnis sicher: Gegner im vierten Halbfinale eines Europacups für Leverkusen nach 1988, 1995 und 2002 wäre entweder der souveräne niederländische Tabellenführer Feyenoord Rotterdam oder der letztjährige Conference-League-Sieger AS Rom mit Trainer José Mourinho.\nQuelle: F.A.Z.\nHier können Sie die Rechte an diesem Artikel erwerben.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-gtm-b7nea\nWeitere Themen\nKritik an DFL und Leverkusen\n                                \n: \n\nÄrger beim 1.

"{'content': 'Exequiel Palacios (r.) verletzte sich leicht im Hinspiel gegen Saint-Gilloise\nFünf Wechsel hatte  Leverkusen-Trainer Xabi Alonso (41) beim 0:0 in der  Bundesliga in  Wolfsburg gegenüber dem 1:1 in der  Europa League gegen Saint-Gilloise vorgenommen.\nDass Exequiel Palacios (24) in der Startelf fehlen würde, war zu erwarten.  Der argentinische Weltmeister musste gegen die Belgier vergangenen Donnerstag wegen Problemen in der hinteren Oberschenkelmuskulatur zur Pause raus.\nZum Wolfsburg-Spiel reichte es für den seit Wochen sehr starken Palacios dann noch nicht.

Er fühlt sich jeden Tag besser. Wir sind optimistisch, aber wir müssen ein bisschen abwarten.“ Mit anderen Worten: Bei Palacios wird es ein Wettlauf gegen die Zeit.\nKlar scheint bereits: Alonso wird im Kampf ums Halbfinal-Ticket wieder rotieren!\nRobert Andrich (29) machte es in Wolfsburg als „Libero“ zwar erneut hervorragend (BILD-Note 2). Er wird aber, wie schon in der Schlussphase gegen die „Wölfe“, ins defensive Mittelfeld zurückkehren und Jonathan Tah (26) wieder von Anfang an die Rolle des Abwehrchefs übernommen. Dazu beginnt Florian Wirtz (19), wahrscheinlich auch Amine Adli (22) anstelle von Sardar Azmoun (28).\n\nDass die Aufstellung in Wolfsburg schon einen klaren Wink für das Rückspiel gab, wollte Sport-Boss Simon Rolfes (41) so nicht bewerten: „Der Blick geht nicht nur auf Donnerstag, du musst grundsätzlich schauen, dass die Kräfte gut verteilt sind, dass alle Spieler frisch sind und du auch alle mitnimmst. Alle geben im Training Gas und haben es auch verdient, wieder ihre Einsatzminuten zu bekommen.

"{'content': 'Die Siegesserie von Bayer Leverkusen ist gerissen. Für das Team von Trainer Xabi Alonso reichte es im Auswärtsspiel am Sonntag beim VfL Wolfsburg nur zu einem 0:0, zuvor hatte Bayer fünfmal in Folge in der Fußball-Bundesliga gewonnen. Das torlose Remis taugt auch nur bedingt als Mutmacher für das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in der Europa League am kommenden Donnerstag bei Union Saint-Gilloise (Hinspiel 1:1). In der Bundesliga-Tabelle bleibt Leverkusen Sechster, der VfL belegt mit vier Punkten Rückstand weiter den neunten Platz.\nBayer-Coach Alonso rotierte im Vergleich zur Europacup-Partie gegen den belgischen Club Union Saint-Gilloise auf fünf Positionen und ließ unter anderem die Nationalspieler Florian Wirtz und Jonathan Tah zunächst auf der Bank. ""Heute brauchen wir etwas anderes"", sagte der Weltmeister von 2010 vor dem Anpfiff.\nAllerdings merkte man der zuletzt besten Bundesliga-Mannschaft die hohe Belastung durch die internationalen Spiele merklich an. Die langen Bälle auf die von VfL-Trainer Niko Kovac als ""flinken Jungs"" bezeichneten Offensiv-Stars um Moussa Diaby kamen nur selten an. Von der Spielfreude der vergangenen Wochen war kaum etwas zu sehen. Die beste Gelegenheit in der ersten halben Stunde besaß Adam Hlozek. Der Tscheche traf zwar die Latte, Passgeber Jeremie Frimpong stand jedoch zuvor im Abseits (27.).\nNicht viel besser machten es die Wolfsburger, die die vorherigen fünf Heimspiele nicht gewinnen konnten. Ohne den erkrankten Kapitän Maximilian Arnold fehlte vor 20.137 Zuschauern Power im Mittelfeld. Die beste und einzige VfL-Chance vor der Pause hatte Yannick Gerhardt, dessen Kopfball knapp über das Tor von Bayer-Torhüter Hradecky ging (33.).\nBeide Teams kamen deutlich schwungvoller aus der Kabine und es gab im Vergleich zur ersten Hälfte Tor-Möglichkeiten. Wolfsburgs Angreifer Omar Marmoush scheiterte an Hradecky (47.). Auf der Gegenseite parierte Koen Casteels einen Diaby-Schuss (53.) glänzend mit dem Fuß.\nBayer-Coach Alonso brachte nach knapp einer Stunde Offensiv-Star Wirtz. Mit der Einwechslung des 19 Jahren alte Ausnahmetalents wurde Bayer dominanter und legte die Europa-League-Strapazen immer weiter ab. Einen Schlenzer von Kerem Demirbay klärte VfL-Keeper Casteels zur Ecke.\nAllerdings blieb die kurze Offensiv-Phase der Alonso-Elf ohne Wirkung. Wolfsburg befreite sich und hatte durch den eingewechselten Patrick Wimmer die Chance auf den Siegtreffer. Der Offensivspieler scheiterte aber am gut reagierenden Hradecky. Auf der Gegenseite vergab Amine Adli (88.).\nBeim Jubiläum von Trainer Urs Fischer hat der 1. FC Union Berlin einen großen Schritt Richtung Champions League verpasst. Im 200. Pflichtspiel ihres Trainers an der Seitenlinie kamen die Eisernen am Sonntag gegen den VfL Bochum nur zu einem 1:1 (1:0). Josip Juranovic (45.+3 Minute) brachte die Gastgeber im Stadion an der Alten Försterei mit einem sehenswerten Freistoßtor in Führung. Kevin Stöger (55.) erzielte per Foulelfmeter aber den Ausgleich für den Revierclub.\nIn der Schlussphase mühten sich Berliner trotz Unterzahl nach der Gelb-Roten-Karte für Paul Jaeckel (62.) noch um den Siegtreffer. Immerhin konnte die imposante Serie von ungeschlagenen Heimspielen auf 20 Partien ausgebaut werden. Union zog durch das Remis wieder an RB Leipzig auf den dritten Platz der Fußball-Bundesliga vorbei, hat mit 52 Punkten aber nur einen Zähler Vorsprung auf die Sachsen und zwei auf den SC Freiburg, der als Fünfter jenseits der Königsklassen-Ränge steht. Bochum konnte durch den wacker erkämpften Punkt als 15. den Vorsprung auf die Abstiegszone auf drei Zähler ausbauen.\nViel ""Schärfe"" hatte Fischer in dem Duell mit dem Revierclub erwartet. Mit Schmackes legte wie vom Schweizer erhofft sein Team los. Rani Khedira wurde gleich beim ersten Angriff gerade noch von einem Gegenspieler am Einschuss gehindert. Danilho Doekhis Versuch nach dem folgenden Eckball ging über das Tor. Der Niederländer hatte kurz darauf eine weitere Chance, doch der Schuss geriet zu lasch.\nBochums Zutaten für einen attraktiven frühen Fußball-Abend waren limitiert. Ambitionen auf einen eigenen Torerfolg wurden erstmal hinten angestellt. In der Bochumer Defensive musste der Ex-Unioner Keven Schlotterbeck (12.) früh mit Verdacht auf eine Knieverletzung raus, für ihn kam der aktuell aus Berlin ausgeliehene Dominique Heintz.\nDa sich die Berliner gegen die Körperlichkeit des VfL schwertaten, geriet das Spiel zäh. Kevin Behrens, der sich als Zielspieler im Duell mit Bochums Blocker Ivan Ordets mächtig aufrieb, setzte einen Kopfball (20.) am Tor vorbei.\nFischer wirkte ziemlich unruhig, fast schon genervt. Nach einem Wortdisput mit Schiedsrichter Tobias Stieler über eine offenkundig falsche Einwurf-Entscheidung bearbeitete der Coach ein großes freigetretenes Rasenstück direkt vor seiner Trainerbank mit Händen und Füßen.\nUnweit des geflickten Grüns setzte Jerome Roussillon (37.) wenig später zu einer Flanke an, die verunglückte und wurde gerade dadurch gefährlich. Das Winken zur Entwarnung von VfL-Torwart Manuel Riemann war jedenfalls verfrüht. Der Ball klatschte auf die Latte.\nEinen Glücksschuss brauchten die Unioner –\xa0und sie bekamen ihn. In der Nachspielzeit trat Juranovic aus rund 25 Metern in zentraler Position zum Freistoß an und zirkelte den Ball über die Bochumer Mauer ins Tor. Haltbar für Riemann? Bayern-Schlussmann Yann Sommer hätte für ein vergleichbar nutzloses Fliegen in München sicher eine Torwart-Diskussion an der Backe.\nBochum musste nun mehr tun. Und, sieh an, sie taten mehr. Patrick Osterhage (47.) setzte eine Art Warnschuss knapp neben den Torwinkel. Ein ziemlich ungeschicktes Einsteigen von Aïssa Laïdouni gegen Ordets führte zum unstrittigen Elfmeterpfiff Stielers. Stöger schoss zum Ausgleich ein. Fischers Laune wurde noch schlechter, als sich Jaeckel für ein zweites plumpes Foul die Gelb-Rote Karte einhandelte. Der Union-Jubel über ein vermeintliches Eigentor von Riemann (66.) nach Schuss von Behrens war wertlos. Der Video-Referee erkannte eine Abseitsposition. Kurz vor Schluss hatte Behrens eine weitere Chance zum Sieg (85.).\nVergleichsportal\nGutscheine für Sport-Shops\n\n\n© G+J Medien GmbH\nZugang zu allen STERN PLUS-Inhalten und Artikeln aus dem Print-Magazin\nwerbefrei & jederzeit kündbar\nBereits registriert?'}",Jonathan Tah,de

Unter anderem sitzen Verteidiger Jonathan Tah (27) und Spielmacher Florian Wirtz (19) vorerst auf der Bank.\nDer Spanier will seine Leistungsträger für das Rückspiel gegen den belgischen Erstligisten am nächsten Donnerstag schonen. Dann geht es um den Einzug ins Halbfinale. Jeremie Frimpong (22): „Wir konnten unsere Chancen leider nicht verwerten. Aber wir lernen jedes Spiel noch dazu. Donnerstag wird ein ganz wichtiges Spiel für uns.“\nFür Bayer bleibt zu hoffen, dass sich die Rotation gelohnt hat. Denn in Wolfsburg hatte sie Folgen! Ohne Nationalspieler Wirtz fehlt es an Kreativität in der Offensive. Sieht auch Alonso ein, der seinen Jungstar in der 62. Minute einwechselt. Mit Erfolg! Mit Wirtz wird auch Leverkusen stärker.\nZum sechsten Sieg in Folge reicht es aber nicht mehr. Immerhin: Eine Super-Serie bleibt bestehen! Leverkusen bleibt wettbewerbsübergreifend im elften Spiel ungeschlagen. Durch das Remis festigt Bayer Rang sechs in der Liga, steht mit zwei Punkten Vorsprung auf dem Platz, der für die Teilnahme an der Conference League reichen würde.\nWolfsburg versinkt durch die Punkte-Teilung weiter im Niemandsland der Liga.

Note 3.\nDer FC Liverpool will sich im Sommer angeblich mit einem Bayern-Star verstärken.\nJONATHAN TAH: Der Abwehrchef setzte seine zuletzt starken Leistungen auch gegen die Belgier fort. Enorme Präsenz in den Zweikämpfen, bester Leverkusener. Note 2.\nPIERO HINCAPIE: Der Ecuadorianer ließ über links nichts anbrennen, musste aber in der 40. Minute per Kopf das 1:0 erzielen.

Note 4.\nMITCHEL BAKKER: Einziger neuer Spieler in der Startelf. Der Niederländer brauchte etwas Anlaufzeit, steigerte sich in der zweiten Hälfte deutlich. Seine Top-Flanken auf Frimpong (78.) und Azmoun (90. plus 4) hätten Tore verdient. Note 3.\nAMINE ADLI: Die Vorlage auf Moussa Diaby kurz vor der Pause war seine beste Szene.

Deshalb: Note 2.\nMOUSSA DIABY: Der Franzose verzog Sekunden vor dem Pausenpfiff nur um Zentimeter. Hatte es schwer gegen die gut organisierte Abwehr der Gäste, ackerte und rannte aber unermüdlich. Note 3.\nKEREM DEMIRBAY (ab 46. für Palacios): Zurück im Kader nach leichten Knie-Problemen aus dem Schalke-Spiel. Nahm sich der Standards an, versuchte es auch immer wieder aus der Distanz. Note 3.\nSARDAR AZMOUN (ab 67. für Adli): Nur vier Minuten nach seiner Einwechslung schien das Spiel für ihn schon wieder vorbei, der Iraner hatte sich offenbar vertreten. Mit ihm als zentralen Stürmer änderte sich die Statik, Bayer wurde immer gefährlicher. Starke Vorlage auf Wirtz. Sekunden vor Schluss fehlten ihm Zentimeter nach Bakkers Flanke.

Den Führungstreffer für die Belgier hatte der Nigerianer Victor Boniface erzielt (51.), der schon in der Runde zuvor gegen den Bundesliga-Dritten aus Berlin zwei Treffer erzielt und einen vorbereitet hatte.\nWie groß die Euphorie in Leverkusen rund um dieses Spiel war, zeigte sich zwei Stunden vor dem Anpfiff. Einige Tausend Fans hatten den Mannschaftsbus empfangen. Nur mit Mühe konnte sich der Bus den Weg durch die Fans bahnen, eingehüllt in eine Nebelwolke von zahlreichen Pyros.\nDoch die nur auf einer Position veränderte Bayer-Elf wirkte zunächst eher nervös und fahrig, fabrizierte gegen die robusten Belgier in der Anfangsphase ungewöhnlich viele Abspielfehler. Als erster kleiner Brustlöser diente ein Konter in der 7. Minute, bei dem Amine Adli seinen Kollegen Wirtz schnell bediente und der aus 18 Metern knapp verzog.\nEinen kurzen Schockmoment erlebten die Gastgeber in der siebten Minute, als Torhüter Lukas Hradecky sich entweder verschätzte oder ein extrem gutes Auge hatte. Einen harmlosen Aufsetzer von Lazare Amani wollte er über das Tor springen lassen, doch der Ball landete auf der Latte (13.). Eine Viertelstunde später musste Hradecky bei einem Schrägschuss von Boniface dann richtig eingreifen.\nNach der anschließenden Ecke hatte Leverkusen gleich doppelt Glück. Zunächst prallte der Ball vom Arm von Jonathan Tah an die Unterkante der Latte, dann entschied der Video-Schiedsrichter nach Ansicht der Bilder, dass das Handspiel nicht elfmeterreif war. Nun mehrten sich die Torchancen, auch für die Werkself. Doch Moussa Diaby verzog zweimal knapp (30./45.+1), Piero Hincapié köpfte bei der größten Gelegenheit am langen Pfosten aus zwei Metern und spitzem Winkel daneben (40.). Insgesamt bekämpften die Belgier die Stärken des Bundesligisten aber gut. Beispielhaft dafür war es, dass Jeremie Frimpong und Diaby auf Bayers starker rechter Seite ihre Schnelligkeit kaum ausspielen konnten.\nUnd dann fiel das Tor tatsächlich auf der Gegenseite, als der starke Boniface den Ball aus zehn Metern ins lange Eck schlenzte. Bayer rannte nun an, aber zunehmend wild und hektisch, was die disziplinierten Gäste selten vor große Probleme stellte. In der Schlussphase gelang dann aber doch der erlösende Ausgleichstreffer, als Wirtz mit einem Distanzschuss genau zielte.\nQuelle: ntv.de, tsi/dpa'}",Jonathan Tah,de

Die Reaktion des Nationalspielers auf die taktisch bedingte Zwangspause war eindrucksvoll - besonders im Duell mit Frankfurts Kolo Muani.\nJonathan Tah nahm gegen Frankfurt nicht nur den Top-Scorer der Liga aus der Partie.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Sven Simon\nEs war eine Szene, die allen klar machte, mit welchem Vorsatz Jonathan Tah in die Begegnung gegangen war: In der 12. Minute eroberte der Innenverteidiger erst mit einem Tackling im eigenen Strafraum gegen Rafael Borré den Ball, verhinderte mit starkem Körpereinsatz an der Torauslinie gegen den Kolumbianer die Ecke und holte danach unter Bedrängnis gegen Borré und Buta sogar einen Einwurf heraus. Eine klasse Aktion.\nUnd ein Signal an die Mannschaft und an sich selbst, die große Aufgabe an diesem Nachmittag zu meistern. ""Für Jona war es ein großes Ziel, gegen Kolo Muani zu spielen. Aber als ich gesehen habe, wie er in den ersten Minuten in den Zweikampf gegangen ist, war mir klar, dass er bereit war. Kolo Muani zu verteidigen ist nicht einfach, aber er, Edi (Tapsoba, Anm. d. Red.) und Odilon (Kossounou, Anm. d. Red.) haben es echt super gemacht"", lobte Trainer Xabi Alonso, ""das war ein wichtiger Faktor für unseren Sieg.""\nDie beschriebene Szene war der Auftakt einer herausragenden Leistung des 27-Jährigen, der sich weiterhin extrem zweikampfstark präsentierte, sehr aufmerksam verteidigte und zudem auch noch eine der guten Leverkusener Chancen vor der Pause mit einem energischen Vorstoß und einem feinen Pass in die Tiefe einleitete, ehe er nicht nur in der stürmischen Schlussphase der Hessen bei Pässen und Flanken Bayers Defensive stabil hielt.\nAuch Simon Rolfes zollte dem Nationalspieler dafür Anerkennung. ""Jona hat es gut gemacht, auch am Ende wichtige Zweikämpfe und Kopfballduelle gewonnen"", urteilte der Geschäftsführer und hob die Bedeutung von Tahs Wirken hervor: „Frankfurts Stürmer lassen sich ja immer wieder fallen, um zwischen den Linien die Bälle zu kriegen, und haben gute Spieler mit Kolo Muani, die das ausnutzen. Jona ist immer wieder vorgeschoben, hat sie nicht in diesen Räumen aufdrehen lassen. Das ist ganz wichtig. Da haben die Frankfurter viel Qualität, die sie diesmal nur in vereinzelten Situationen ausspielen konnten.""\nKolo Muani wurde nie wirklich gefährlich, was Tahs Leistung insgesamt abrundete. Diese war nach seiner Nicht-Berücksichtigung für die Startelf beim 2:1-Sieg gegen Bayern München zwei Spieltage zuvor umso bemerkenswerter. Gegen den Rekordmeister hatte Xabi Alonso aus taktischen Gründen lieber Sechser Robert Andrich als besseren Spieleröffner ins Abwehrzentrum beordert. Ein Schachzug, der aufging - auf Kosten Tahs, der erst in der Schussminute zur Ergebnissicherung eingewechselt wurde.\nFür mich ist das keine Entwicklung - das ist sein Niveau.\nDoch der Abwehrbulle zeigte Charakter, spielte schon beim 3:0 auf Schalke gut und legte jetzt eine noch bessere Leistung nach, die für seinen Trainer keine Überraschung darstellte. ""Für mich ist das keine Entwicklung - das ist sein Niveau"", urteilte Xabi Alonso, ""ich muss entscheiden, wie wir spielen. Ich weiß, dass Jona fast immer ein super Niveau zeigt."" Gegen Frankfurt tat er das eindrucksvoll.\nTah ist nach seiner Bayern-Pause voll da, wirkt extrem selbstbewusst. Wie lange Bayer an dem Abwehrspieler noch Freude haben wird, bleibt abzuwarten. Zwar läuft der Vertrag des 27-Jährigen noch bis 2025, aber mit seinem Beraterwechsel zu Pini Zahavi Anfang des Jahres hat Tah das klare Signal gegeben, im Sommer seine Karriere woanders fortsetzen zu wollen. Mit Leistungen wie gegen Frankfurt hilft er Bayer akut sehr - und macht überdies beste Werbung für sich.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jonathan Tah,de
"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nLässt Gegner schlecht aussehen und macht die Mitspieler besser: Leverkusens Teenager Florian Wirtz (Zweiter von rechts).\nDer 19-jährige Mittelfeldspieler treibt Leverkusen zu einem 3:1-Erfolg, von seiner Finesse profitiert die gesamte Mannschaft. Trainer Xabi Alonso blickt nun auf eine besondere Statistik - bei der Eintracht ist man arg angefasst.\nVon Milan Pavlovic, Leverkusen\nDie Ansage aus der Redaktion nach dem Pausenpfiff ist klar: eine Ode anstimmen auf Florian Wirtz. Nichts einfacher als das nach einer Vorstellung wie jener beim Spiel zwischen Bayer Leverkusen und Eintracht Frankfurt. Der gerade einmal 19-jährige Feinfuß servierte die beiden ersten Bayer-Tore an diesem gelungenen Nachmittag mit Leichtigkeit - und das in voller Bewegung und trotz der Bedrängnis durch büffelartige Gegenspieler, die wie so viele Gegner versuchten, Wirtz auf den Füßen zu\xa0stehen.\nDabei hätte Wirtz\' Arbeitstag auch schmerzvoll beginnen können. Schon nach neun Sekunden hatte Frankfurts Djibril Sow seine Stollen auf dem Schuh des Nationalspielers platziert. Der blieb einigermaßen unversehrt und fand danach immer neue Schlupflöcher, um sich den Gästen zu entziehen und seine Kollegen in Szene zu\xa0setzen.\nAuch beim mühsamen 1:0 im Breisgau fehlt es den Münchnern an Leichtigkeit. Nach dem Spiel provoziert Joshua Kimmich die gegnerischen Fans - eine Szene, die tief blicken lässt.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Sebastian Leisgang\nBeim 1:0 hatte er schon im Voraus geguckt, ob er Amine Adli mit einem Direktpass in die Gasse schicken könnte. Konnte er. Und so lief Adli ungebremst los - und versenkte den Ball angemessen sehenswert mit dem linken Außenrist knapp über Torwart Kevin Trapp zur Führung ins\xa0Netz.\nSchon nach zehn Minuten war in dieser unterhaltsamen Partie also klar, dass eine kuriose Rekordserie fortgesetzt würde: Zum 76. Mal fand das Duell Leverkusen gegen Frankfurt in der Bundesliga statt, zum 76. Mal würde es keine Nullnummer\xa0geben.\nSchnell, schneller, Diaby: Der französische Stürmer bejubelt sein Tor zum 2:0 - nach einem Pass von Florian Wirtz.\nDie Hauptattraktion blieb aber Wirtz: Der schmückte den Anlass mit einer zweiten Torvorlage. In der 34. Minute tippte er ein Anspiel etwa 30 Meter vor dem gegnerischen Tor kurz an, schaute einmal hoch, sah, wie der flinke Moussa Diaby in den Vollsprint-Modus schaltete und spielte ihm den Ball zwischen zwei Frankfurter Verteidiger in den Lauf - und zwar so, dass sein Mitspieler weder abbremsen noch beschleunigen musste. Der Rest - ein cool platzierter Abschluss ins entfernte Toreck - war pure Freude für den französischen Stürmer\xa0(34.).\nDanach war Wirtz mehrfach knapp dran am lupenreinen Assist-Hattrick, doch entweder verdaddelten seine Mitspieler gute Ideen. Oder Kevin Trapp lenkte einen kaum haltbaren Ball von Adli noch neben den Pfosten (43.). Was bei Wirtz ja gerne übersehen wird: Er schafft es mit seinem Spiel, auch den Kollegen Sicherheit zu geben. Gegen Frankfurt fielen vor allem die Verteidiger Edmond Tapsoba und Jonathan Tah auf, die sich erfolgreich auf den Frankfurter Stürmer Randal Kolo Muani konzentrierten. Auch Torschütze Adli und Stürmer Exequiel Palacios zeigten - inspiriert vom Wirtz-Wirbel - ihr\xa0Können.\nDass es nicht noch mehr nennenswerte Aspekte an Wirtz\' Darbietung gab, lag auch an ihm selbst. Denn wenn es darum ging, selbst zu treffen, wirkte er weniger zielstrebig, was Trapp in der 53. Minute eine weitere Parade ermöglichte. Dennoch sah es lange nach einen Osterspaziergang für den Werksklub aus - auch weil die Frankfurter die Kraft vermissen ließen, die sie in der vergangenen Saison international so furchteinflößend gemacht\xa0hatte.\nFrankfurt wirkte klar unterlegen, bis Bayer 04 die Eintracht einlud, sich vielleicht doch einen völlig unverdienten Punkt zu schnappen. Nach einem kollektiven Aussetzer der Gastgeber beim Anschlusstor durch Sow (74.) ging Leverkusen fast jede Souveränität flöten. Zumal Wirtz in der 77. Minute ausgewechselt wurde. Die Eintracht hatte zwar keine echte Chance mehr zum 2:2, aber das Chaos bei den Leverkusenern war beachtlich - es löste sich erst, als dem eingewechselten Azmoun nach einem Konter das erlösende 3:1 gelang\xa0(90.+5).\nBayer-Trainer Xabi Alonso stapelte danach tief, indem er sagte: ""Wir haben noch nichts geschafft."" Aber das stimmte nicht ganz, denn er hat damit aus seinen 19 Spielen als Coach nun 38 Punkte geholt, also einen glatten Zweier-Schnitt pro Partie - und das trotz anfänglicher Probleme (inklusive eines 1:5 im Hinspiel in\xa0Frankfurt).\nDas bedeutet auch, dass das Team des Spaniers die Frankfurter früher als gedacht von Platz sechs verdrängt hat - vor sechs Spieltagen hatte die Eintracht noch elf Punkte vor Bayer 04 gelegen. Darauf angesprochen, verfinsterte sich die Miene des zuletzt häufig schlecht gelaunten Frankfurter Trainers Oliver Glasner weiter. Dass Mario Götze mal wieder wegen Meckerns verwarnt wurde, weshalb er das nächste Spiel aussetzen muss, war das i-Tüpfelchen auf diesem Nachmittag. ""Sie wollen mich provozieren"", sagte Glasner zu einem Sky-Interviewer und beendete das Gespräch - so wie er bald darauf bei der Pressekonferenz seltsam angefasst reagierte und sagte: ""Ich lasse mich heute nicht provozieren. Ostern ist ein Friedensfest. Ich wünsche Euch allen frohe Ostern mit Euren\xa0Familien.""\nDer Abwehrspieler erlöst die Münchner mit einem Fernschuss, Sadio Mané und Serge Gnabry suchen verzweifelt das Glück - und Kimmich sorgt für eine Rudelbildung nach Schlusspfiff.

Das 3:1 gegen Eintracht Frankfurt am Samstag war bereits der siebte Pflichtspielsieg in Serie für die Werkself. Und die will noch mehr.\nRedebedarf: Jonathan Tah (li.) und Randal Kolo Muani im Spiel zwischen Leverkusen und Frankfurt.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Beautiful Sports\n""Was uns gerade so stark macht, ist, dass wir uns auf jedes einzelne Spiel konzentrieren. In der ersten Halbzeit haben wir brutal dominiert. Wir waren von erster Sekunde wach, haben jede 50:50-Aktion gewonnen"", freute sich Jonathan Tah nach der Partie bei ""Sky"". ""Es tut gut, so stark ins Spiel zu starten. Wir arbeiten als Mannschaft zusammen und jeder hilft jedem, das zeichnet uns zur Zeit aus"", schob der Abwehrspieler nach dem siebten Pflichtspielsieg in Serie - und fünften in Folge in der Bundesliga - nach.\nTah selbst war immer wieder in direkte Duelle mit Frankfurts herausragendem Torjäger Randal Kolo Muani verwickelt, hatte in der ersten Hälfte einmal Glück gehabt, dass er nach einem Ellbogenschlag ins Gesicht des Franzosen nicht die Gelbe Karte sah, war ansonsten gegen den agilen Kolo Muani aber sehr präsent. Hochkarätige Chancen spielte sich die SGE so kaum heraus. ""Mir war bewusst, dass es nicht einfach wird. Aber ich war im Kopf hellwach, bin in sehr guter Form und habe mich gut gefühlt - ich hatte Bock darauf"", meinte Tah zum Duell mit Kolo Muani.\nNur einen kleinen Schönheitsfehler fand Tah dann doch im eigenen Spiel: Den Gegentreffer knapp 20 Minuten vor dem Ende, durch den die Partie noch einmal spannend wurde. ""Nach dem Gegentor wird es noch einmal brenzlig, das hat nicht sein müssen"", so der 27-Jährige.\nLob für die Spielweise der Werkself gab es derweil auch vom Gegner. So habe das hohe Tempo der Rheinländer in der ersten Hälfte der SGE ""das Genick gebrochen"", meinte Frankfurts Keeper Kevin Trapp. Und Eintracht-Kapitän Sebastian Rode verwies auf die jüngste Niederlage des FC Bayern an gleicher Stelle, der ebenfalls Probleme mit dem Tempo Leverkusens gehabt habe.\nZufrieden mit dem Spiel war natürlich auch der Bayer-Coach: ""Die erste Halbzeit haben wir gut kontrolliert, wir hatten einige Chancen und haben unseren Vorteil gut verteidigt. Nach dem 2:1 hatten wir etwas Druck gespürt. Am Ende war es ein wichtiger Schritt, doch es gibt weiterhin noch einiges zu tun"", sagte Xabi Alonso, der damit - wie von Tah als derzeitiges Erfolgsrezept ausgemacht - schon die nächsten Aufgaben im Blick hat. ""Wir blicken nicht auf die Tabelle, sondern halten die Füße auf dem Boden und machen weiter. Es gibt keine andere Formel für uns"", bekräftigt der Spanier.\nUnd die nächste Aufgabe für Leverkusen wartet bereits am Donnerstag (21 Uhr) und heißt Union Saint-Gilloise. Dann geht es im Viertelfinalhinspiel der Europa League um nicht weniger als die Grundsteinlegung für den Halbfinaleinzug in einem europäischen Wettbewerb.\njom\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Jonathan Tah,de

Pechvogel bei den anrennenden Gästen ist DFB-Stürmer Timo Werner.\nHöhenflug in Europa, Aufholjagd in der Liga: Die Titeljäger von Bayer Leverkusen haben ihren beeindruckenden Lauf auch gegen RB Leipzig fortgesetzt. Drei Tage nach dem Sprung ins Europa-League-Halbfinale schlug die gnadenlos effektive Mannschaft von Trainer Xabi Alonso den DFB-Pokalsieger 2:0 (1:0) und nahm vorsichtig die Champions-League-Plätze ins Visier. ""Es läuft überragend gerade bei uns, ich bin sehr stolz auf die Mannschaft. Wir haben wie Löwen als Mannschaft verteidigt"", sagte Jonathan Tah bei DAZN: ""Wir machen immer weiter und sind nicht zufrieden.""\nAdam Hlozek (40.) und Nadiem Amiri (86., Foulelfmeter) erzielten vor 29.085 Zuschauern die Tore für die Leverkusener, die auch ohne Florian Wirtz im achten Ligaspiel in Folge ungeschlagen blieben. Die Leipziger, die im siebten Auswärtsspiel erstmals bei Bayer verloren und das Spiel nach einer Gelb-Roten Karte gegen Dominik Szoboszlai (85.) zu zehnt beendeten, sind nur noch vier Punkte entfernt und rutschten nach dem 29. Spieltag aus den Königsklassen-Plätzen. Bayer lauert unmittelbar dahinter als Sechster. ""Wir haben nicht schlecht gespielt, aber das bringt uns nichts - wir haben es nicht konsequent genug zu Ende gespielt"", sagte Leipzigs Benjamin Henrichs. Diese fehlende Konsequenz ""kostet uns Punkte"".\nNach dem Einzug ins erste Europapokal-Halbfinale seit 21 Jahren am Donnerstag wechselte Alonso dreimal - zweimal davon zwangsweise: Der formstarke Wirtz fehlte am späten Sonntagnachmittag wegen Magen-Darm-Beschwerden ebenso wie Edmond Tapsoba, der aufgrund von muskulären Problemen aussetzen musste.\nGegen Angstgegner Leipzig, der vor dem Duell nur zwei von 13 Pflichtspielen gegen die Rheinländer verloren hatte, agierten die Leverkusener anfangs deutlich passiver als noch unter der Woche bei Union Saint-Gilloise (4:1). Die Anfangsphase gehörte den Gästen: Timo Werner, Doppelpacker beim 3:2 gegen den FC Augsburg, testete Bayer-Torwart Lukas Hradecky erstmals (6.).\nLeverkusen streute immer wieder ungewohnte Fehlpässe und technische Fehler im Spielaufbau ein. Leipzig konnte die Ballgewinne aber zunächst nicht in gezielte Angriffe ummünzen. Das Spiel verflachte in der Folge: Bayer überließ RB meist den Ball und lauerte auf Konter - spielte die wenigen Umschaltaktionen aber anfangs zu ungenau aus. Aus dem Nichts sorgte Piero Hincapie (32.) mit einem Lattentreffer aus rund 30 Metern für die beste Bayer-Szene bis dahin, Leverkusen war nun aktiver und belohnte sich: Hlozek vollendete einen Konter nach einer scharfen Hereingabe von Moussa Diaby technisch stark mit links.\nDie Führung kam zu diesem Zeitpunkt überraschend und bescherte Bayer gleichwohl Sicherheit. Leipzig, mit drei Pflichtspielsiegen in Folge ins Rheinland gereist, schien beeindruckt. Wirtz verfolgte auf der Tribüne bei starkem Regen, wie Bayer die Führung mit zunehmender Spieldauer nur noch verwaltete. Rose hatte zur Pause Christopher Nkunku, der nach seinem Muskelfaserriss das zweite Spiel bestritt, für Kevin Kampl gebracht und damit offensiv gewechselt.\nNkunku (62.) leitete mit seinem Abschluss die beste Leipziger Phase ein. Die müde wirkenden Leverkusener beschränkten sich nur noch aufs Verteidigen und gingen damit ins Risiko. Werner (66.) vergab eine Riesenchance gegen Hradecky.

Es war die beste Leistung der Werkself in dieser Saison.\nDie BILD-Einzelkritik zum Viertelfinal-Rückspiel.\nLukas Hradecky: In der ersten Hälfte nicht geprüft. Machtlos beim Gegentor seines finnischen Landsmannes Kasper Terho. Sensationeller Reflex in der 75. Minute mitten in der Drangphase der Belgier. Note 2.\nEdmond Tapsoba: Der Burkiner stand sehr sicher und schaltete sich immer wieder gut mit ins Aufbauspiel ein. Wegen leichter muskulärer Beschwerden musste er früh raus. Note 2.\nJonathan Tah: So stark, so sicher, so gut – seine körperliche Präsenz war – wie im Hinspiel – beeindruckend. Sein Traumpass auf Azmoun kurz vor Schluss wäre die Krönung auf eine erneut sensationelle Vorstellung des Abwehrchefs gewesen. Tah ist in dieser Verfassung ganz klar wieder ein DFB-Kandidat. Note 1.\nPiero Hincapie: Hielt seine linke Seite weitestgehend dicht. Der Ecuadorianer kassierte kurz vor der Pause einen üblen Tritt von Lazare Amani auf die Wade, der mit der Roten Karte hätte bestraft werden müssen. Note 2.\n\nVortänzer: Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong und seine Kollegen feiern den Halbfinal-Einzug\nJeremie Frimpong: Ob vorne oder hinten – Frimpong war überall gleichzeitig, reagierte cool und nutzte seine Chance zum 3:0. Note 2.\nRobert Andrich: Wieder ein starker Auftritt des „emotionalen Leaders“ der Werkself, der längst eine Nominierung in der Nationalelf verdient hätte. Bei ihm merkte man in jeder Sekunde an, wie viel Lust er auf diese Nacht hatte. Note 2.\nNadiem Amiri: Dass er anstelle des angeschlagenen Exequiel Palacios beginnen würde, überraschte viele – wohl auch die Belgier. In der Offensive wenig Akzente, dafür enormer Einsatz für die Mannschaft. Note 3.\nMitchel Bakker: Ein Monster-Spiel des Niederländers. Volley-Abnahme zum 2:0, dann setzte er Union-Keeper Moris derart unter Druck, dass dieser Frimpong den Ball zum 3:0 „auflegte“. Auch das 4:1 leitete Bakker ein. Mehr geht nicht – bester Auftritt im Bayer-Trikot. Weltklasse. Note 1.\nMoussa Diaby: Der Franzose schoss das schnellste Europa-League-Tor der Saison. Auch an der Entstehung des zweiten und vierten Treffers entscheidend beteiligt. Note 2.\n\nFlorian Wirtz springt Mitchel Bakker auf den Rücken vor Freude\nAdam Hlozek: Stand überraschend in der Startelf und zahlte dieses Vertrauen eindrucksvoll zurück mit einer Super-Flanke auf Bakker zum 2:0 und seinem Abstauber zum 4:1, der das Spiel endgültig entschied. Note 2.\nFlorian Wirtz: Sorgte direkt für Unruhe in Unions Abwehr, was zum 1:0 durch Diaby führte. Sein Pass auf Diaby leitete den Traumkonter zum 2:0 ein. Aber: Sein Ballverlust führte auch zum Anschlusstreffer der Belgier. Die entscheidenden Szenen hatten diesmal andere, wobei sein kämpferischer Einsatz herausragend war. Note 3.\nKerem Demirbay (ab 59./für Amiri): Wie in den letzten Wochen mit einer guten Leistung. Er sorgte nach seiner Hereinnahme vor allem dafür, dass Bayer in der Druckphase der Belgier wieder die Kontrolle fand. Note 2.\n\nStolz auf seine Sieger: Leverkusens Trainer Xabi Alonso\nOdilon Kossounou (ab 59./für Tapsoba): Der Ivorer musste für den angeschlagenen Tapsoba die rechte Abwehrseite übernehmen, hatte in der Drangphase der Belgier auch einige Probleme, arbeitete sich aber von Minute zu Minute besser ins Spiel. Note 3.\nAmine Adli (ab 71./für Frimpong): Am Ende reichte es beim Franzosen zumindest für einen Joker-Einsatz, hatte kurz vor Schluss eine gute Schusschance. Note 3.\nSardar Azmoun (ab 86./für Hlozek): Der Iraner hatte in der Nachspielzeit zwei gute Möglichkeiten, vergab jedoch beide. Ohne Note.\nKarim Bellarabi (ab 86./für Diaby): Auch der Fan-Liebling bekam seine Chance, scheitert aber frei vor Torwart Moris. Ohne Note.\nXabi Alonso: Seine Mannschaft gewann über eine starke Defensive und effektive Offensive das Spiel deutlich. Kluge Wechsel in den richtigen Momenten brachten die Belgier in ihrer Drangphase aus dem Konzept. Sein Team ist seit zwölf Pflichtspielen unbesiegt, Alonsos Anteil an dieser Stabilität ist enorm.

Die ersten 90 Minuten dieses Viertelfinales belegen, dass die Mannschaft von Xabi Alonso vor einer brutal schweren Aufgabe steht.\nFlorian Wirtz hielt Bayer Leverkusen in der Spur.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Nordphoto\nEin 1:1 zu Hause in einem Viertelfinal-Hinspiel. Dazu noch gegen ein Team, gegen das man rein von der Papierform klarer Favorit war - auf den ersten Blick war das Ergebnis, das Bayer 04 gegen Union Saint-Gilloise am Donnerstag in der Bay-Arena erzielte eine Enttäuschung.\nDoch am Ende war es immerhin ein Unentschieden, das dem Bundesligisten durch den Wegfall der Auswärtstor-Regelung eine absolut neutrale Ausgangsposition bescherte, was während der 90 Minuten alles andere als selbstverständlich erschien.\nSchließlich lieferte der Tabellenzweite der Jupiler Pro League eine Demonstration höchster Verteidigungskunst ab. Wohl noch kein Team hielt in dieser Saison Bayer 04 so mannschaftlich geschlossen vom Tor fern, verteidigte so kompakt, so automatisiert ineinandergreifend, so dass die Elf von Xabi Alonso selbst ihre klaren Schnelligkeitsvorteile kaum ausspielen konnte. So war nicht nur Jeremie Frimpong auf der rechten Schiene selten so ausgebremst worden in seinem offensiven Treiben, wie in diesen 90 Minuten.\nFolglich behielt die Enttäuschung über das Resultat nicht die Oberhand gegenüber der Freude über das späte 1:1 von Florian Wirtz, der den Ball nach Vorarbeit des eingewechselten Sardar Azmoun aus etwa 20 Metern überlegt ins lange Eck platzierte.\nXabi Alonso sprach später von einem ""Pass"", mit dem der Jungstar den Ball im Netz ""geparkt"" habe. In der Tat war es ein höchst präzises Manöver auf engstem Raum, das nicht nur jedem Fahrschüler zu Ehre gereicht hätte. Das aber auch belegte, was nötig sein wird, um die Belgier zu bezwingen.\n""Es war ein sehr gut herausgespieltes Tor. Der Raum war sehr eng.  Da waren sieben Spieler unmittelbar um den Ball und zwei von uns. Das war von der Qualität her eine Riesentor. Das haben wir uns aber erarbeitet: Wir sind klar geblieben, haben immer weiter versucht, nach vorne zu spielen, auch wenn es nicht einfach war, weil die Lücken sehr, sehr klein waren"", fasste Sechser Robert Andrich den Leverkusener Treffer sowie die schwierige Aufgabe für die Werkself treffend zusammen.\nBis zu diesem 1:1 waren Bayer und Wirtz der Verzweiflung nahe. Die Belgier, die kurz nach der Pause nicht einmal unverdient in Führung gegangen waren, waren bis zu dem Kunstschuss des 19-Jährigen kaum zu knacken gewesen. Die beiden besten Chancen hatte vielmehr der zweimal durch den Fünfmeterraum irrlichternde Union-Keeper Anthony Moris ermöglicht, der jeweils eine Flanke unterlief und es nur der fehlenden Präzision der Schützen Piero Hincapie und Jeremie Frimpong, die ihre Kopfbälle aus wenigen Metern neben das Tor setzten, zu verdanken hatte, dass seine Fehler nicht bestraft wurden.\nDoch nachdem Bayer vor der Pause in zwei, drei Umschaltaktionen beim letzten Pass entweder unpräzise agiert oder die falsche Entscheidung getroffen hatte, entnervten die Belgier die Gastgeber mit der Zeit zusehends, was sogar ein Genie wie Wirtz in der Phase vor dem 1:1 dazu verleitete, den Ausgleich mit überhasteten Pässen in nicht vorhandene Räume erzwingen zu wollen.\nSaint-Gilles hatte Bayer kurz vor dem Kontrollverlust. Dass dieser aber nicht eintrat, war essentiell. ""Wir wussten, dass es so ein Spiel werden könnte. Natürlich möchtest du 2:0, 3:0 gewinnen, aber manchmal geht es halt nicht. Dann musst du das Spiel annehmen. Sie haben immer wieder den Rhythmus gebrochen. Wichtig war, dass wir im Kopf klar bleiben, die Ruhe bewahren, und dafür wurden wir mit dem Tor belohnt"", erklärte Andrich, der in dem 1:1 ""ein vernünftiges Ergebnis fürs Rückspiel"" sieht.\nTrotz aller von den Belgiern auf höchstem Niveau platzierter Hindernisse, zeigte sich der Mittelfeldspieler optimistisch. ""Das ist eine abgezockte Truppe, sie machen es einem nicht einfach. Aber wenn wir unsere Stärken auf den Platz bringen, bin ich zuversichtlich, dass wir weiterkommen."" Wobei es aber ja gerade das Problem darstellt, gegen Union sein eigenes Offensivspiel zu entfalten.\nSo dürfte es auch kommende Woche in Brüssel auf Details ankommen wie das Wirtzsche Parkmanöver oder die Präzision bei aussichtsreichsten Kopfballchancen. Viele solcher Momente dürften die Belgier auch dann nicht zulassen.\nBayer wird das Optimum in die Waagschale werfen müssen, um weiterzukommen. Ob Bayer dabei auf Andrichs Kollegen in der Doppelsechs, Exequiel Palacios, zurückgreifen kann, ist offen. Der Weltmeister musste zur Halbzeit angeschlagen raus, weil die hintere Oberschenkelmuskulatur sich meldete. ""Pala hatte ein ungutes Gefühl, aber nicht, dass etwas gerissen ist. Wir müssen abwarten"", erklärte Xabi Alonso.\nDer Einsatz des zuletzt so formstarken Palacios könnte wie zuletzt auch im Rückspiel ein entscheidendes Detail darstellen, in dem sich die Ausgangsposition gegenüber dem Hinspiel nicht verändert hat. ""Alles ist offen"", weiß der Trainer, der aber genauso den Hunger nach mehr formulierte wie Fernando Carro. ""Wir sind positiv, haben Selbstvertrauen"", sagte der Geschäftsführer, ""die Lust auf mehr ist schon da - bei allen.""\nWobei es vor allem die Lust zu Leiden und die mentale Stärke, nicht die Linie zu verlieren, sein werden, die Bayer gegen die konterstarken Defensivmonster von Union Saint-Gilloise aufbringen muss, um zum ersten Mal seit 2002 wieder ein europäisches Halbfinale zu erreichen.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Piero Hincapie,de

Selbst bei Dauer-Patient Patrik Schick gibt es günstige Zeichen dafür, dass der Torjäger nach Monaten des Leidens im Saisonendspurt noch ein Faktor werden kann.\nLeverkusens Patrik Schick trainiert derzeit individuell.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Just Pictures\nKerem Demirbay, der nach seiner Einwechslung auf Schalke wegen Patellasehnenproblemen den Platz wieder vorzeitig hatte verlassen müssen, absolvierte am Dienstag große Teile des Mannschaftstrainings. Eine Rückkehr des Mittelfeldspielers in das Spieltagsaufgebt steht in dieser Woche in Aussicht. Relativ sicher am Sonntag in Wolfsburg, ""wenn er die Trainingsbelastung gut verkraftet, vielleicht schon am Donnerstag"", wie Geschäftsführer Simon Rolfes erklärt.\nBeim Abschlusstraining vor dem Europa-League-Viertelfinale gegen Saint-Gilles war Demirbay genauso dabei wie Stürmer Adam Hlozek, der zuletzt wegen eines Infekts fehlte, und Verteidiger Piero Hincapie, der gegen Frankfurt wegen einer schmerzhaften Prellung an der Hüfte ausgewechselt worden war.\nIm anstehenden Europa-League-Hinspiel wird auch Nadiem Amiri, den Beschwerden am Oberschenkel plagten, wieder bereitstehen. Der Mittelfeld-Allrounder stieg bereits am Freitag wieder ein und ist einsatzfähig. Somit verfügt Xabi Alonso um ein paar Alternativen mehr vor den vier Knackspielen gegen die Belgier sowie Wolfsburg und den Viertplatzierten aus Leipzig, in denen Bayer die Chance wahren möchte, sich noch für die Champions League zu qualifizieren.\nSo schnell wie das Quartett wird Patrik Schick, der seit Anfang November fast durchgehend wegen Leistenbeschwerden ausfiel, noch nicht zurückkehren. Doch der x-te Anlauf des tschechischen Torjägers gibt zumindest ein bisschen Anlass zur Leverkusener Hoffnung, dass der Mittelstürmer in dieser Saison doch noch wichtig werden könnte.\nMomentan arbeite der Nationalspieler mit dem Athletik-Team individuell auf dem Platz. ""Die Belastung wird gesteigert und er ist weiter schmerzfrei"", weiß Rolfes zu berichten, ""er ist auf einem ganz guten Weg.""\nDieser soll den 27-Jährigen dahin führen, im Endspurt dieser Spielzeit noch ein echter Faktor zu werden. Im Mai, wenn Bayer - vorausgesetzt die nächsten vier Partien verlaufen erfolgreich - noch eine doppelte Chance auf ein Champions-League-Ticket besitzen könnte, soll Schick wieder entscheidende Tore schießen statt Aufbautraining zu absolvieren. ""Wir sind ganz guten Mutes, dass das klappt"", zeigt sich Rolfes optimistisch.\nEs wäre das nächste positive Signal dafür, dass es Schick und Bayer gelingen könnte, diese Saison aus Leverkusener Sicht doch noch mit einem Happy End abzuschließen.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Piero Hincapie,de

Im Moment bekommen die beiden Freunde höchst unterschiedliche Signale, was ihre sportliche Zukunft betrifft.\nRückschlag: Leverkusens Techniker Kerem Demirbay.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Treese\nBeim 0:0 in Berlin waren sie beide nicht mit von der Partie. Weder Nadiem Amiri noch Kerem Demirbay kamen an der Alten Försterei gegen Union zum Zuge. War dies für den gelbgesperrten Amiri logisch, so stellte sich die 90-minütige Absenz von und für Demirbay durchaus als überraschend dar.\nSchließlich hatte neben Amiri mit Exequiel Palacios auch ein zweiter direkter Konkurrent um die beiden Plätze in der Doppelsechs gefehlt, sodass Demirbay der letzte verbliebene ""Spezialist"" für den Part neben Robert Andrich war. Allerdings entschied sich Xabi Alonso dann für eine besondere Lösung.\nSo nominierte der Spanier Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba für das defensive Mittelfeld. Während der Nationalspieler aus Burkina Faso mit seiner Leistung auf ungewohnter Position zufrieden sein durfte, stellte Xabi Alonsos Entscheidung für Demirbay einen nächsten Rückschlag dar.\nZumal dessen Fähigkeit, Mitspieler mit gechippten Bällen in gute Abschlusspositionen zu bringen, gegen die tief und dicht gestaffelte Berliner Defensive ein durchaus hilfreiches Mittel hätte sein können. Doch Xabi Alonso entschied sich für den defensiver denkenden Tapsoba und gegen den Techniker, der sich nur warmlaufen durfte. Mehr nicht.\nFür den 29-Jährigen, der Ende Januar kurz vor einer Leihe zu Hertha BSC stand, ehe Bayer ein Veto einlegte, ein weiteres klares Signal, wie es um seine Perspektiven in Leverkusen bestellt ist. Auch unter Xabi Alonso ist er keine unangefochtene Stammkraft, sondern rotiert regelmäßig zwischen Ersatzbank, Jokerrolle und Startelf.\nEin Status, der den früheren deutschen Nationalspieler und Confed-Cup-Gewinner natürlich nicht zufriedenstellt. Geschäftsführer Simon Rolfes bewertet die für Demirbay enttäuschende Entscheidung des Trainers nur mit den Worten: ""Das gibt es schon mal.""\nDer Kurs von Bayers einst 32 Millionen teuren Rekordeinkauf fällt weiter. Der von Nadiem Amiri, der 2019 gemeinsam mit Demirbay von der TSG Hoffenheim nach Leverkusen kam, hat sich hingegen unter Xabi Alonso auf gutem Niveau gefestigt. Deshalb soll der vielseitige Mittelfeldspieler seinen bis 2024 laufenden Vertrag vorzeitig verlängern. ""Wir sind in Gesprächen"", bestätigt Rolfes, der Amiris ""Flexibilität und sein Feuer"" lobt.\nBesser die Sperre jetzt als zum Beispiel im Derby gegen Köln.\nDieses wird am Freitag im Derby gegen den FC definitiv wieder brennen, falls Amiri zum Einsatz kommt. Schließlich hatte der 25-Jährige seine fünfte Gelbe Karte vor dem Union-Spiel eindeutig eingeordnet mit den Worten: ""Besser die Sperre jetzt als zum Beispiel im Derby gegen Köln.""\nWelche Rolle Demirbay gegen den FC einnimmt, bleibt abzuwarten. Erst recht, da nicht nur Amiri, sondern womöglich auch Palacios zurückkehrt, der im ZDF Sportstudio erklärte: ""Mein Ziel ist es, am Freitag zu spielen.""\nUnd perspektivisch droht Demirbay, dessen Vertrag 2024 ausläuft, ein weiterer Statusverlust, weil Bayer für die kommende Saison einen defensiv denkenden Sechser verpflichten möchte. Was dies alles für den Linksfuß bedeutet, ist eine Frage, die sich der Techniker auch selbst stellen muss. Falls er sie nicht längst für sich beantwortet hat.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

Torjäger Patrik Schick droht jetzt sogar ganz konkret das Saison-Aus.\nEine Saison zum Vergessen mit drohendem Aus: Leverkusens Torjäger Patrik Schick.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Revierfoto\n""Es ist die wichtigste Phase der Saison"", sagt Xabi Alonso zwei Tage vor der Partie bei Union Berlin (Samstag, 15.30 Uhr, LIVE! bei kicker), ""fast jedes Spiel ist der Schlüssel zu unserem Erfolg in dieser Saison."" Oder anders formuliert: Jedes Spiel ist für Bayer ein Endspiel. Wie schon das Viertelfinal-Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise (4:1) in Anderlecht und das Gastspiel von RB Leipzig (2:0) am vergangenen Sonntag.\nBayer 04 benötigt eine Verlängerung der Erfolgsserie, die mittlerweile seit 13 Pflichtspielen andauert, in denen der Werksklub unbesiegt ist. Um noch die letzte kleine Chance auf Platz 4 und damit ein Ticket für die Champion League über die Bundesliga zu wahren, helfen nur Siege. Auch wenn es am Samstag zu den so heimstarken Eisernen geht. Die an der Alten Försterei in dieser Spielzeit unbesiegt sind - neun Siege und fünf Remis stehen bei der Fischer-Elf zu Buche, die damit dieselbe Bilanz wie der FC Bayern aufweist. Saisonübergreifend blickt Union sogar auf 21 Heimspiele ohne Niederlage zurück.\nFür dieses nächste Schlüsselspiel haben sich Ideengeber Florian Wirtz (nach Magen-Darm-Infekt) und Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba (muskuläre Probleme) zurückgemeldet. Für Exequiel Palacios hat es indessen noch nicht gereicht. ""Er spürt noch etwas im Oberschenkel"", hakt Xabi Alonso einen Einsatz des argentinischen Sechsers am Wochenende ab.\nWährend Palacios zeitnah zurückkehren soll, ist dies bei Sorgenkind Patrik Schick, der seit Anfang November mit Leistenproblemen fast durchgehend ausfällt, nicht abzusehen. Vielmehr ist der Versuch des tschechischen Nationalstürmers, endlich wieder schmerzfrei und fit zu werden, erneut gescheitert.\nEs ist nicht einfach für uns. Es ist nicht einfach für ihn. Wir müssen weiter warten.\nUnd die Worte, die Xabi Alonso am Freitag wählte, verbreiteten keine Zuversicht: ""Patrik ist nicht Teil der Mannschaft.  Wir haben uns entschieden, dass er einen anderen Weg geht"", sagte der Trainer, ohne danach genauer erklären zu wollen oder zu können, wie dieser andere Weg aussieht. Auch die explizite Nachfrage, ob Schick operiert werden müsse - was lange ausgeschlossen wurde - ließ der Spanier unbeantwortet.\nUnabhängig davon, klingt die Prognose für Schick ungünstig. ""Er ist jetzt und normalerweise auch nächste Woche nicht dabei"", gab Xabi Alonso als Ausblick, ""für einen längeren Zeitraum kann ich nichts sagen. Ich bin kein Arzt."" Klar ist, dass auch der x-te Anlauf Schicks gescheitert ist. ""Die Verbesserung ist nicht so schnell eingetreten wie erhofft"", so Xabi Alonso, ""es ist nicht einfach für uns. Es ist nicht einfach für ihn. Wir müssen weiter warten.""\nSo wird das drohende Saison-Aus zumindest immer deutlicher sichtbar. Ein Startelfeinsatz ist aufgrund der langen Ausfallzeit und des zwangsläufig bestehenden körperlichen Rückstands in dieser Spielzeit quasi auszuschließen - egal, ob es zu einer Operation kommt oder nicht. Bayer muss seine Endspiele ohne den Torjäger planen.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

Doch voraussichtlich wird nicht das komplette Trio bei der Partie an der Alten Försterei gegen Union Berlin dabei sein.\nFlorian Wirtz spielt seit 2019 für Bayer Leverkusen.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Crystal Pix\nBeim 2:0-Erfolg gegen RB Leipzig am Sonntag hatte Xabi Alonso gleich auf vier potenzielle Schlüsselspieler verzichten müssen. Neben dem langzeitverletzten Torjäger Patrik Schick, der weiterhin Aufbautraining bestreitet, und Exequiel Palacios, der sich beim Viertelfinal-Hinspiel in der Europa League gegen Union Saint-Gilloise an der hinteren Oberschenkelmuskulatur verletzt hatte, mussten auch Edmond Tapsoba und Florian Wirtz passen.\nAm Mittwoch kehrten Wirtz, Tapsoba und Palacios zwar auf den Trainingsplatz zurück. Allerdings absolvierte das Trio nur eine individuelle Einheit. Tapsoba, den schon zuvor beim Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise muskuläre Probleme geplagt hatten, spulte dies genauso wie Palacios unter Anleitung von Athletiktrainer Daniel Jouvin ab.\nInwieweit das Trio am Samstag in der Partie bei Union Berlin zur Verfügung steht, das für Bayer 04 das nächste ""Endspiel"" um Platz 4 wird, bleibt abzuwarten. Die besten Karten besitzt Spielmacher Wirtz, der von seinem Infekt genesen ist und nun bis Samstag wieder zu Kräften kommen muss. Prognose: positiv.\nFür die beiden muskulär angeschlagenen Akteuren ist ein Ausblick nicht so einfach. Für Palacios dürfte es bis Samstag zeitlich eng werden. Schließlich hat der argentinische Weltmeister seit zwei Wochen kein Mannschaftstraining mehr absolviert. Für die Startelf kann er so eigentlich keine Rolle spielen, wenn er überhaupt rechtzeitig match-fit wird.\nFällt Palacios (für die Anfangsformation) aus, würde zwangsläufig Kerem Demirbay neben Robert Andrich in der Doppelsechs beginnen, da Nadiem Amiri gegen Leipzig seine 5. Gelbe Karte sah und gesperrt ist. Womit Xabi Alonso für das defensive Mittelfeld nur noch Daley Sinkgraven oder der 18-Jährige Noah Mbamba als Optionen als Einwechselspieler zur Verfügung stehen würden. Oder mit Odilon Kossounou, der diese Position vor seiner Leverkusener Zeit schon ein paarmal spielte, ein gelernter Verteidiger.\nSomit wäre Andrichs Einsatz im Mittelfeld zwingend erforderlich - und Xabi Alonso könnte nicht auf die Variante mit dem 28-Jährigen als zentralen Mann der Dreierabwehrkette zurückgreifen. Was wiederum die Einsatzfähigkeit von Tapsoba nochmal bedeutsamer macht.\nSchließlich ist der Nationalspieler aus Burkina Faso der beste Spieleröffner unter Bayers Innenverteidigern. Ohne ihn (und ohne die Option Andrich in der Abwehrkette) würde Leverkusens auf einem gepflegten Aufbau aus der Defensive basierendes Spiel ein wichtiges Element fehlen.\nSo gewinnt die Fitness Tapsobas eine zusätzliche Brisanz, auch wenn Kossounou diesen gegen Leipzig gut vertrat. Allerdings darf sich Tapsoba, der bei Union Saint-Gilloise vorsichtshalber ausgewechselt und gegen Leipzig mit Blick auf den Saisonendspurt präventiv geschont worden war, bessere Chancen als Palacios ausrechnen, den Wettlauf mit der Zeit zu gewinnen.\nStephan von Nocks\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

Doch der Torschütze zum 2:0-Endstand gegen RB Leipzig pendelt in Leverkusen trotzdem zwischen den Extremen.\nNadiem Amiri trifft vom Punkt zum 2:0 für Leverkusen gegen Leipzig\r\n\r\n                                        picture alliance / BEAUTIFUL SPORTS/Wunderl\nEine solche Szene wäre vor sieben Monaten noch undenkbar gewesen.  Nachdem Schiedsrichter Daniel Schager in der 86. Minute der Partie gegen RB Leipzig (2:0)\xa0beim Stand von 1:0 auf Strafstoß für Bayer 04 entschieden hatte, schnappte sich Nadiem Amiri den Ball und verwandelte sicher.\nIm Frühherbst wäre der 26-Jährige nie in diese Situation gekommen, spielte er doch unter dem damaligen Trainer Gerrardo Seoane nur eine ganz untergeordnete Rolle. Doch seit Xabi Alonso bei Bayer 04 das Zepter schwingt, sind die Aktien des vielseitigen Mittelfeldspielers wieder gestiegen - und damit auch dessen Selbstvertrauen.\n""Ich habe mich spontan entschieden"", erklärte Amiri, wie es dazu kam, dass ausgerechnet er zu diesem entscheidenden Elfmeter antrat, ""wir üben unter der Woche immer mal Elfmeterschießen. Da fühle ich mich ziemlich sicher und habe auch eine ganz gute Quote. Da war für mich klar, dass ich, wenn ein Elfmeter kommt, den reinmache.""\nAmiri strahlte dabei die Stärke aus, die derzeit nahezu alle Akteure im Kader fühlen. Und die dazu führt, dass der Werksklub gegen RB sogar den Ausfall von vier absoluten Leistungsträgern übertünchen konnte. Fehlten doch neben dem langzeitverletzten Mittelstürmer Patrik Schick und dem muskulär angeschlagenen Sechser Exequiel Palacios kurzfristig auch noch Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba (muskuläre Probleme) und Ideengeber Florian Wirtz (Magen-Darm-Infekt) - und damit eine komplette Achse.\n""Natürlich sind Flo, Eddie, Pala und Patrik super Spieler, aber wir haben viele super Spieler im Kader. Wir haben das heute gut ausgeglichen. Da sieht man, dass wir als Mannschat im Flow sind und du eigentlich jeden spielen lassen kannst"", ordnete Amiri, der am Donnerstag beim 4:1-Sieg bei Union Saint-Gilloise im Viertelfinal-Rückspiel der Europa League für Palacios in die Startelf gerückt war, Bayers Fähigkeit ein, Ausfälle entscheidender Akteure zu kompensieren.\nDoch es passt zumindest zu dieser Saison der Extreme, dass Joker Amiri am Sonntag selbst zwischen diesen pendelte. Denn nach seinem Treffer und dem anschließenden Jubel auf dem Zaun vor den Fans sah er seine 5. Gelbe Karte und fehlt somit am Wochenende bei Union Berlin. Amiri wird es verkraften.\nZumal Trainer Xabi Alonso nach der Partie gegen Leipzig in Aussicht stellte, dass Wirtz, Tapsoba und Palacios in dieser Woche ins Training zurückkehren sollten. Damit hätten sich Amiri Einsatzchancen auch ohne Sperre wieder reduziert. Und so wird der frühere Nationalspieler (5 Einsätze) sich in den nachfolgenden Partien empfehlen müssen. Sein Vertrag läuft im Sommer 2024 aus. Verlängern oder verkaufen lautet die Frage für den Klub im Sommer. Entschieden ist nichts.\nKlar scheint, dass der extrem einsatzfreudige Amiri egal, ob in Leverkusen oder woanders, finanzielle Abstriche machen wird, da er bei seinem Wechsel von 1899 Hoffenheim nach Leverkusen im Sommer 2019 ein sehr gut dotiertes Arbeitspapier erhielt. Der Spieler selbst sieht seine Situation locker: ""Was meine Zukunftsplanung betrifft, ist alles offen. Ich bin tiefenentspannt"", erklärt er und verriet, dass er sich zuletzt ganz andere Sorgen machte.\n""Ich hatte nach dem Dortmund-Spiel sehr lange Adduktorenprobleme und bin einfach nur froh, dass ich wieder gesund bin"", sagte der Kämpfer, ""weil es zwischendrin hieß, dass vielleicht die Saison für mich zu Ende ist."" Zumindest dieses negative Extrem blieb ihm aber letztlich erspart.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

""Am Ende läuft alles unter dem Übergriff Galligkeit, Gier und Zug zum Tor"", sagte Rose nach dem 0:2 (0:1) am Sonntagabend.\nBei den sichtlich müden Leverkusenern, die drei Tage zuvor in das Halbfinale der Europa League eingezogen waren, verbuchte RB 26 Torschüsse und 9:0 Ecken bei 63 Prozent Ballbesitz. Doch am Ende half das nichts, denn es kamen nicht einmal viele Großchancen dabei heraus. ""Das ist das x-te Spiel in dieser Saison, das wir einfach nicht hätten verlieren dürfen"", sagte der Coach: ""Das ist so ein bisschen die Geschichte unserer Saison.""\nUnd vielleicht dachte er sogar wehmütig an das Rennen um den Meistertitel zwischen seinem Ex-Club Borussia Dortmund und dem FC Bayern, als er sagte: ""Das ist sehr schade.

""Xabi ist da ganz entspannt"", erklärte er auf die Frage, wieviel Bier denn im Mannschaftsbus auf der Heimfahrt konsumiert werden dürfe, ""er war auch mal Spieler. Jeder muss selbst wissen, was er trinken kann, aber ich glaube, bis fünf sind erlaubt.""\nDoch so viel der Belohnung wird Leverkusens Trainer seinen Profis keine 72 Stunden vor dem Bundesligaheimspiel gegen RB Leipzig nicht gegönnt haben, um die Regenration vor dem nächsten Endspiel für Bayer 04 nicht zu stark zu beeinträchtigen. Schließlich hat Bayer 04 auch in der Liga noch große Ambitionen.\n""Wir haben noch die Chance, uns für Europa zu qualifizieren. Es gibt noch viele Möglichkeiten. Als wie Zehnter waren, haben wir uns auf den Europapokal fokussiert, aber gerade wollen wir in der Bundesliga und Europa erfolgreich sein"", erklärte Xabi Alonso nach dem überzeugenden Sieg im Anderlechter Lotto Park und vor der Partie beim Tabellenvierten. Diese stellt wohl die letzte, wenn auch verschwindend kleine Möglichkeit dar, sich über die Liga noch ein Ticket für die Königsklasse zu sichern.\nUnter welchen personellen Voraussetzungen Bayer diese Chance wahrnehmen möchte, hängt - unabhängig vom Bierkonsum im Mannschaftsbus - an der physischen Verfassung des einen oder anderen Profis. So nahm der Trainer in Anderlecht Edmond Tapsoba nach knapp einer Stunde vom Feld, um keine Verletzung des stark spielenden Innenverteidigers zu riskieren und diesen am Sonntag zur Verfügung zu haben.\n""Er hatte eine wenig muskuläre Probleme, also musste ich ihn schützen.  Wir haben noch viele Spiele, schon am Sonntag gegen Leipzig"", erklärte Xabi Alonso, ""Edie ist ein sehr wichtiger Spieler für uns."" Dessen Ausscheiden Odilon Kossounou nicht komplett kompensieren konnte.\nBangen um Tapsoba also, aber auch leichte Hoffnung zumindest auf Exequiel Palacios, der gegen Saint-Gilles wegen einer Oberschenkelverletzung erwartungsgemäß noch fehlte, nachdem er am Mittwoch einen ersten Trainingsversuch unternommen hatte. ""Es gibt eine Chance, dass er spielen kann"", glaubt Xabi Alonso, ""wir müssen bis Sonntag abwarten.""\nVon der Rückkehr des aggressiven Sechsers, wie Tapsoba zuletzt eine Säule des Bayer-Spiels, könnten diverse Überlegungen des Trainers abhängen, wie dieser sein Zentrum in Abwehr und defensiven Mittelfeld personell und taktisch zusammenstellt.\nUnabhängig davon, welchen seiner Profis er gegen Leipzig das Vertrauen schenkt, glaubt er, dass diese trotz der körperlichen Belastung bereit sein werden. ""Manchmal, wenn der Kopf frei ist, ist es egal, wenn die Beine müde sind. Dann kannst du trotzdem mit Energie spielen, das wollen wir am Sonntag probieren."" Um auch in der Liga noch ein großes Ziel im Auge zu behalten - und danach vielleicht doch das eine oder andere Bier mehr trinken zu dürfen.\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de
"{'content': 'Party mit den Fans: Die Bayer-Profis Moussa Diaby (v.l.), Lukas Hradecky, Florian Wirtz, Karim Bellarabi, Piero Hincapie und Jonathan Tah\nHALBFINALE!\nBayer Leverkusen stürmte mit einem 4:1-Sieg über Royale Union Saint-Gilloise ins Semifinale der  Europa League.  Es war die beste Leistung der Werkself in dieser Saison.\nDie BILD-Einzelkritik zum Viertelfinal-Rückspiel.\nLukas Hradecky: In der ersten Hälfte nicht geprüft. Machtlos beim Gegentor seines finnischen Landsmannes Kasper Terho. Sensationeller Reflex in der 75. Minute mitten in der Drangphase der Belgier. Note 2.\nEdmond Tapsoba: Der Burkiner stand sehr sicher und schaltete sich immer wieder gut mit ins Aufbauspiel ein. Wegen leichter muskulärer Beschwerden musste er früh raus. Note 2.\nJonathan Tah: So stark, so sicher, so gut – seine körperliche Präsenz war – wie im Hinspiel – beeindruckend. Sein Traumpass auf Azmoun kurz vor Schluss wäre die Krönung auf eine erneut sensationelle Vorstellung des Abwehrchefs gewesen. Tah ist in dieser Verfassung ganz klar wieder ein DFB-Kandidat. Note 1.\nPiero Hincapie: Hielt seine linke Seite weitestgehend dicht. Der Ecuadorianer kassierte kurz vor der Pause einen üblen Tritt von Lazare Amani auf die Wade, der mit der Roten Karte hätte bestraft werden müssen. Note 2.\n\nVortänzer: Torschütze Jeremie Frimpong und seine Kollegen feiern den Halbfinal-Einzug\nJeremie Frimpong: Ob vorne oder hinten – Frimpong war überall gleichzeitig, reagierte cool und nutzte seine Chance zum 3:0. Note 2.\nRobert Andrich: Wieder ein starker Auftritt des „emotionalen Leaders“ der Werkself, der längst eine Nominierung in der Nationalelf verdient hätte. Bei ihm merkte man in jeder Sekunde an, wie viel Lust er auf diese Nacht hatte. Note 2.\nNadiem Amiri: Dass er anstelle des angeschlagenen Exequiel Palacios beginnen würde, überraschte viele – wohl auch die Belgier. In der Offensive wenig Akzente, dafür enormer Einsatz für die Mannschaft. Note 3.\nMitchel Bakker: Ein Monster-Spiel des Niederländers. Volley-Abnahme zum 2:0, dann setzte er Union-Keeper Moris derart unter Druck, dass dieser Frimpong den Ball zum 3:0 „auflegte“. Auch das 4:1 leitete Bakker ein. Mehr geht nicht – bester Auftritt im Bayer-Trikot. Weltklasse. Note 1.\nMoussa Diaby: Der Franzose schoss das schnellste Europa-League-Tor der Saison. Auch an der Entstehung des zweiten und vierten Treffers entscheidend beteiligt. Note 2.\n\nFlorian Wirtz springt Mitchel Bakker auf den Rücken vor Freude\nAdam Hlozek: Stand überraschend in der Startelf und zahlte dieses Vertrauen eindrucksvoll zurück mit einer Super-Flanke auf Bakker zum 2:0 und seinem Abstauber zum 4:1, der das Spiel endgültig entschied. Note 2.\nFlorian Wirtz: Sorgte direkt für Unruhe in Unions Abwehr, was zum 1:0 durch Diaby führte. Sein Pass auf Diaby leitete den Traumkonter zum 2:0 ein. Aber: Sein Ballverlust führte auch zum Anschlusstreffer der Belgier. Die entscheidenden Szenen hatten diesmal andere, wobei sein kämpferischer Einsatz herausragend war. Note 3.\nKerem Demirbay (ab 59./für Amiri): Wie in den letzten Wochen mit einer guten Leistung.

Die Fragezeichen hinter Amine Adli und Exequiel Palacios werden daher wahlweise gestrichen und gesetzt.\nBayer macht ein Geheimnis um Amine Adlis Einsatz.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Team 2\nUnmittelbar vor dem Abschlusstraining stand Xabi Alonso zusammen mit seinen Assistenten und Exequiel Palacios auf dem Rasen in der Bay-Arena zusammen, ehe sich der Argentinier nach wenigen Minuten zu seinen Kollegen gesellte und die Einheit begann. Doch ob der Mittelfeldspieler, der im Hinspiel eine Verletzung an der hinteren Oberschenkelmuskulatur erlitten hatte, am Donnerstag im Lotto Park zu Anderlecht mitspielen kann, ist damit alles andere als gesichert.\nSchließlich hatte der 24-Jährige am Dienstag noch nicht mit der Mannschaft trainieren können und das leichte Traben sowie das Kreisspiel beim Aufwärmen lassen dazu nicht auch nur irgendeine Erkenntnis zu. Einen Effekt hat die Teilnahme von Palacios an den ersten 15, für die Öffentlichkeit einsehbaren Minuten aber in jedem Fall: Union Saint-Gilloise kann sich nicht völlig sicher sein, dass der Sechser ausfallen wird.\nDa es sich um dessen ersten Trainingsversuch handelte sechs Tage nach seiner Verletzung, ist aber davon auszugehen. Zumal auch das Statement von Simon Rolfes zwischen den Zeilen nicht frei von Skepsis war: ""Im Idealfall ist er natürlich fit"", sagte der Geschäftsführer, ohne wirklich etwas aufklären zu wollen, ""heute trainiert er schonmal ein bisschen mit. Es wäre natürlich gut, wenn er spielen kann. Wir müssen sehen, wie er aufs Training reagiert. Von daher gibt es eine Entscheidung erst morgen.""\nPalacios nach einem Trainingsversuch in die Startelf zu berufen, wäre zumindest riskant und zudem kein gutes Signal für Kerem Demirbay, der den Weltmeister zuletzt zweimal mehr als ordentlich vertrat. Vieles spricht dafür, dass diese Personalie ein Teil des Leverkusener Euro-Pokers vor dem Rückspiel in Belgien ist.\nSchließlich wollte Bayer auch eine zweite Karte vor dem Showdown nicht aufdecken. So daddelte Amine Adli abseits der Mannschaft mit einem Ball herum, während seine Kollegen sich beim Kreisspiel vergnügten. Danach begab sich der französische Angreifer, den Xabi Alonso am Sonntag in Wolfsburg fast 80 Minuten lang für die Saint-Gilles-Partie geschont hatte, quer über den Platz Richtung Kabine.\nEine Verletzung, die einen Einsatz am Donnerstag gefährdet? ""Nein, Amine wird dabei sein"", sagte Rolfes überraschend im Brustton der Überzeugung. Doch warum trainierte der 22-Jährige, an dessen Stelle mit Sardar Azmoun ein richtiger Mittelstürmer für den flinken Tiefenläufer in die Startelf rücken würde, dann nicht mit?\nEs sind offenbar die üblichen Spielchen, um den Gegner im Unklaren zu lassen. Wobei die Konstellation, dass Adli in Trainingsklamotten auf dem Platz erschien, aber quasi nicht mitmachte, schon eine ganz spezielle Variante darstellte.\nAdlis Ausfall hätte für die Belgier eine Nachricht mit bedeutenderer Auswirkung, würde sich durch Azmouns Hereinnahme der Ansatz, was das Spiel in die Spitze betrifft, doch schon deutlich verändern. Im Hinspiel gewann Leverkusens Offensive nämlich entscheidend an Durchschlagskraft, als der Iraner in der letzten halben Stunde eingewechselt wurde.\n""Sardar hat es auf jeden Fall gut gemacht, als er reingekommen ist, er hat Präsenz gezeigt, das Tor von Florian Wirtz ja auch gut vorbereitet"", analysierte Rolfes am Mittwoch rückblickend, fügte aber an: ""Erkenntnisse will ich jetzt im Detail nicht nennen."" Natürlich nicht.\nWerden doch nach den offensichtlichen Erkenntnissen aus dem Hinspiel auch in der zweiten Partie gegen die defensivstarken und kaum Fehler begehenden Belgier wahrscheinlich nur Details entscheiden. ""Wir haben eine gute Ausgangsposition"", glaubt Rolfes, ""wir haben alle im Hinspiel aber auch gesehen, wie gut Saint-Gilles ist und dass es ein intensives, ein enges Spiel wird. Trotzdem ist die Motivation, ins Halbfinale einzuziehen, riesig."" Und dafür soll jeder auch noch ach so kleine Vorteil genutzt werden. Sei es auch nur für einen Bluff.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de
"{'content': 'Xabi Alonso weiß, wie man ins Finale kommt und da auch gewinnt. Der frühere Welt- und Europameister will es nun auch als Trainer schaffen. Erst mal muss aber der Einzug ins Halbfinale klappen.\n19.04.2023, 15:04\xa0Uhr\nSportchef Simon Rolfes von Bayer Leverkusen sieht Trainer Xabi Alonso als besonderes Pfund im Kampf um den Einzug ins Halbfinale der Europa League. „Er hat ein paar Halbfinals erreicht in seiner Karriere“, sagte Rolfes am Tag vor dem Viertelfinal-Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise (Donnerstag, 21 Uhr/RTL): „Er hat die Erfahrung, worauf es ankommt am Ende einer langen Saison mit hoher Belastung. Die Strategie, den Willen und die Fokussierung darauf, die mentale Frische zu behalten, verkörpern nur wenige andere so wie er.“ Alonso wurde als Fußball-Profi unter anderem Weltmeister, zweimal Europameister und zweimal Champions-League-Sieger.\nDie Ausgangsposition sei nach dem 1:1 im Hinspiel gut und die Vorfreude in Leverkusen groß, versicherte Rolfes. „Das Spiel ist etwas Besonderes. Das merkt man ja schon daran, wie lange so etwas her ist.“ Zuletzt erreichte Bayer 2002 das Halbfinale eines Europacups. Doch trotz der fünf Wechsel beim 0:0 am Sonntag gegen Wolfsburg genieße die Europa League keine größere Beachtung als die Bundesliga. „Wir versuchen, jeweils die beste Mannschaft aufzubieten“, sagte Rolfes: „Das kann immer bedeuten, dass auch mal zwei, drei andere spielen.“\nFür Donnerstag hofft der Ex-Nationalspieler auf den Einsatz des argentinischen Weltmeisters Exequiel Palacios, der im Hinspiel mit Oberschenkelproblemen ausgewechselt wurde und erst am Mittwoch erstmals wieder trainierte. „Wir müssen sehen, wie er darauf reagiert. Deshalb fällt die Entscheidung erst am Donnerstag“, sagte Rolfes: „Aber es wäre wichtig, wenn er spielen könnte. Er hat in den letzten Wochen eine dominante Rolle eingenommen.“\nDerweil hat Bayer auch explizit für ein mögliches Elfmeterschießen trainiert. „Man muss natürlich auf alles vorbereitet sein“, sagte der Sportchef: „Wir versuchen es in 90 Minuten.

Jetzt scheint Leverkusens Sechser den Wettlauf mit der Zeit vor dem Rückspiel in der Europa League am Donnerstag verloren zu haben.\nExequiel Palacios hat sich im Viertelfinal-Hinspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise verletzt.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Laci Perenyi\nEigentlich sollte die Entscheidung bereits gefallen sein. Dass Exequiel Palacios am Donnerstag beim Viertelfinal-Rückspiel in Brüssel in Leverkusens Startaufstellung steht, müsste so gut wie ausgeschlossen sein. Schließlich konnte der argentinische Mittelfeldspieler, der sich am Donnerstag vergangener Woche im Hinspiel gegen die belgische Überraschungsmannschaft an der hinteren Oberschenkelmuskulatur verletzt hat, auch am Dienstag nicht mit der Mannschaft trainieren.\nEine Bestätigung für einen Ausfall von Palacios wollte am Dienstag zwar noch niemand bei Bayer erteilen, doch zumindest für die Startelf dürfte dessen Fehlen im Dienstagstraining das Aus für den argentinischen Weltmeister bedeuten. Dabei hatte Trainer Xabi Alonso am Sonntag nach dem 0:0 beim VfL Wolfsburg noch konkrete Hoffnungen auf einen Einsatz des Sechsers formuliert. ""Wir müssen warten. Es ist noch fraglich bis Mittwoch oder Donnerstag. Er fühlt sich jeden Tag besser. Wir sind optimistisch, aber wir müssen ein bisschen abwarten"", hatte der Spanier erklärt.\nDoch selbst wenn Palacios am heutigen Mittwoch doch noch einen erfolgreichen Trainingsversuch unternehmen sollte, wäre ein Startelfeinsatz aus dem Stand heraus ein zu hohes Risiko, weil der 24-Jährige nicht topfit sein kann und die Wiedereingliederung auch nach einer leichteren Muskelverletzung bei Bayer im Regelfall nicht so Knall auf Fall erfolgt.\nDie Gefahr, dass sich der zuletzt in Topform aufspielende aggressive Techniker schwerer verletzt, wäre gegeben. Zum anderen präsentierte sich Kerem Demirbay zuletzt als guter Vertreter von Palacios. Beim 1:1 im Hinspiel erledigte er seine Aufgabe in der zweiten Hälfte ordentlich, am Sonntag beim 0:0 in Wolfsburg gehörte er zu den Besten bei Bayer, setzte dabei den einen oder anderen Offensivakzent, den Bayer auch in Brüssel gut gebrauchen könnte.\nDa man beim Werksklub hofft, in den kommenden Wochen in der Europa League genauso wie in der Liga, wo es schon am Sonntag gegen Leipzig um wichtige Punkte für ein Ticket für einen internationalen Wettbewerb geht, noch vor entscheidenden Spielen zu stehen, wäre ein Einsatz von Palacios im Lotto Park in Brüssel womöglich zu kurz gedacht und ein allzu riskanter Zug, der nicht zu Xabi Alonsos Herangehensweise in solchen Fällen passen würde.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

Der argentinische Weltmeister musste gegen die Belgier vergangenen Donnerstag wegen Problemen in der hinteren Oberschenkelmuskulatur zur Pause raus.\nZum Wolfsburg-Spiel reichte es für den seit Wochen sehr starken Palacios dann noch nicht.

Dies gibt Trainer Xabi Alonso gute Gründe zu rotieren. Ein Argument für personelle Wechsel lässt er aber unbeachtet.\nLeverkusens Coach Xabi Alonso steht vor der ""Endspiel-Woche"" vor einem Spagat.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Chai v.d. Laage\nDer Idealfall ist ausgeblieben. Auch wenn nicht damit zu rechnen war, so stellte es doch für Verantwortliche wie Spieler bei Bayer 04 ein Wunschszenario dar, das erste Viertelfinalspiel gegen Union Saint-Gilloise so deutlich zu gewinnen, dass man am Donnerstag in Brüssel vielleicht den einen oder anderen Stammspieler hätte schonen können. Nach dem 1:1 ist diese Konstellation nicht gegeben - erwartungsgemäß.\nSo steht Xabi Alonso mit Bayer 04 innerhalb von acht Tagen vor drei Endspielen: Am Sonntag (19.30 Uhr, LIVE! bei kicker) in Wolfsburg sollte der Werksklub keinen Boden auf den Viertplatzierten RB Leipzig verlieren, der derzeit fünf Punkte Vorsprung hat und nächste Woche in der Bay-Arena aufkreuzt. Am Donnerstag folgt das Rückspiel bei Union Saint-Gilloise, bei dem das Duell ums Halbfinale bei Null beginnt. Und am übernächsten Sonntag steigt für Bayer 04 das Finale um die letzte Chance, in der Liga noch ein Ticket für die Königsklasse zu lösen, mit dem Heimspiel gegen RB.\nPrioritäten zu setzen, ist folglich für Xabi Alonso unmöglich. Ordnet er doch schon die erste Partie in Wolfsburg, zu der Bayer erst am Morgen des Spieltags anreisen wird, als ""sehr wichtiges Spiel für uns"" ein. Logisch, ist ein erfolgreiches Abschneiden doch Voraussetzung dafür, dass das Duell mit Leipzig überhaupt zu einem Endspiel um Platz 4 für Bayer 04 wird.\nSo dürfte der Wille zur Rotation nicht ganz so groß sein, wie er es noch im Februar war, als der Trainer beispielsweise nach dem 3:2-Sieg in Monaco im nächsten Spiel in Freiburg Topstar Florian Wirtz vor der Pause schonte. Trotzdem wird der Spanier sein Personal zumindest teilweise wechseln. ""Wir müssen an das nächste Spiel denken, aber auch an das Rückspiel am Donnerstag"", beschreibt Xabi Alonso den für ihn anstehenden Spagat.\nBei Exequiel Palacios dürfte der Trainer keinerlei Risiko eingehen. ""Bei ihm bestehen die größten Zweifel"" sagte Xabi Alonso am Freitag über den Mittelfeldspieler, der in der Halbzeit über Oberschenkelprobleme geklagt hatte und deswegen ausgewechselt worden war. \xa0Für den Argentinier dürfte Kerem Demirbay beginnen, der den Part des Weltmeisters gegen Saint-Gilles in der zweiten Hälfte zufriedenstellend übernahm.\nEin anderer Wechsel könnte nicht aus Belastungsgründen erfolgen. Nachdem Sardar Azmoun zuletzt als Joker auf Schalke und gegen Frankfurt als Torschütze gestochen hatte, bereitete er nun gegen die Belgier den Ausgleich vor. Gegen ebenfalls defensivstarke Wolfsburger könnte der Iraner den Startelfplatz von Amine Adli erhalten und als richtiger Mittelstürmer hilfreich sein, so wie er es gegen die Belgier war. ""Sardar hatte einen guten Einfluss auf Spiel - nicht nur gegen Saint-Gilles"", lobt Xabi Alonso, der dann die bisherige falsche Neun Wirtz hinter Azmoun positionieren könnte, denn: ""Flo kann diese Position sehr gut spielen, wenn er einen Stürmer vor sich hat.""\nUnd auch ein Wechsel im hintersten Mannschaftsteil liegt nahe, auch wenn Xabi Alonso die drohende Gelbsperren für Jeremie Frimpong und Innenverteidiger Edmond Tapsoba nicht in seine Überlegungen für die Aufstellung einfließen lässt, wie der 41-Jährige erklärt: ""Wenn sie spielen, besteht zwar das Risiko, dass sie ihre fünfte Gelbe Karte sehen, aber das ist für mich kein Argument, sie nicht spielen zu lassen."" Dennoch könnte Odilon Kossounou für einen der beiden Viel-Spieler beginnen.\nStärker dürfte die Rotation nicht ausfallen. Schließlich stellt Wolfsburg doch auch einen Mitbewerber um die internationalen Plätze dar, der Bayer besonders physisch alles abverlangen wird.  ""Sie sind eine der stärksten Mannschaften in der Liga mit viel Kraft, Intensität und Laufstärke. Es ist eine große Aufgabe für uns, nach dem Spiel gegen Saint-Gilles diese Intensität zu erreichen"", sagt Xabi Alonso, ""sie sind ein direkter Konkurrent.""  Den es zu schlagen gilt, um eine echte Endspiel-Woche zu bekommen.\nStephan von Nocks\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

Die ersten 90 Minuten dieses Viertelfinales belegen, dass die Mannschaft von Xabi Alonso vor einer brutal schweren Aufgabe steht.\nFlorian Wirtz hielt Bayer Leverkusen in der Spur.\r\n\r\n                                        IMAGO/Nordphoto\nEin 1:1 zu Hause in einem Viertelfinal-Hinspiel. Dazu noch gegen ein Team, gegen das man rein von der Papierform klarer Favorit war - auf den ersten Blick war das Ergebnis, das Bayer 04 gegen Union Saint-Gilloise am Donnerstag in der Bay-Arena erzielte eine Enttäuschung.\nDoch am Ende war es immerhin ein Unentschieden, das dem Bundesligisten durch den Wegfall der Auswärtstor-Regelung eine absolut neutrale Ausgangsposition bescherte, was während der 90 Minuten alles andere als selbstverständlich erschien.\nSchließlich lieferte der Tabellenzweite der Jupiler Pro League eine Demonstration höchster Verteidigungskunst ab. Wohl noch kein Team hielt in dieser Saison Bayer 04 so mannschaftlich geschlossen vom Tor fern, verteidigte so kompakt, so automatisiert ineinandergreifend, so dass die Elf von Xabi Alonso selbst ihre klaren Schnelligkeitsvorteile kaum ausspielen konnte. So war nicht nur Jeremie Frimpong auf der rechten Schiene selten so ausgebremst worden in seinem offensiven Treiben, wie in diesen 90 Minuten.\nFolglich behielt die Enttäuschung über das Resultat nicht die Oberhand gegenüber der Freude über das späte 1:1 von Florian Wirtz, der den Ball nach Vorarbeit des eingewechselten Sardar Azmoun aus etwa 20 Metern überlegt ins lange Eck platzierte.\nXabi Alonso sprach später von einem ""Pass"", mit dem der Jungstar den Ball im Netz ""geparkt"" habe. In der Tat war es ein höchst präzises Manöver auf engstem Raum, das nicht nur jedem Fahrschüler zu Ehre gereicht hätte. Das aber auch belegte, was nötig sein wird, um die Belgier zu bezwingen.\n""Es war ein sehr gut herausgespieltes Tor. Der Raum war sehr eng.  Da waren sieben Spieler unmittelbar um den Ball und zwei von uns. Das war von der Qualität her eine Riesentor. Das haben wir uns aber erarbeitet: Wir sind klar geblieben, haben immer weiter versucht, nach vorne zu spielen, auch wenn es nicht einfach war, weil die Lücken sehr, sehr klein waren"", fasste Sechser Robert Andrich den Leverkusener Treffer sowie die schwierige Aufgabe für die Werkself treffend zusammen.\nBis zu diesem 1:1 waren Bayer und Wirtz der Verzweiflung nahe. Die Belgier, die kurz nach der Pause nicht einmal unverdient in Führung gegangen waren, waren bis zu dem Kunstschuss des 19-Jährigen kaum zu knacken gewesen. Die beiden besten Chancen hatte vielmehr der zweimal durch den Fünfmeterraum irrlichternde Union-Keeper Anthony Moris ermöglicht, der jeweils eine Flanke unterlief und es nur der fehlenden Präzision der Schützen Piero Hincapie und Jeremie Frimpong, die ihre Kopfbälle aus wenigen Metern neben das Tor setzten, zu verdanken hatte, dass seine Fehler nicht bestraft wurden.\nDoch nachdem Bayer vor der Pause in zwei, drei Umschaltaktionen beim letzten Pass entweder unpräzise agiert oder die falsche Entscheidung getroffen hatte, entnervten die Belgier die Gastgeber mit der Zeit zusehends, was sogar ein Genie wie Wirtz in der Phase vor dem 1:1 dazu verleitete, den Ausgleich mit überhasteten Pässen in nicht vorhandene Räume erzwingen zu wollen.\nSaint-Gilles hatte Bayer kurz vor dem Kontrollverlust. Dass dieser aber nicht eintrat, war essentiell. ""Wir wussten, dass es so ein Spiel werden könnte. Natürlich möchtest du 2:0, 3:0 gewinnen, aber manchmal geht es halt nicht. Dann musst du das Spiel annehmen. Sie haben immer wieder den Rhythmus gebrochen. Wichtig war, dass wir im Kopf klar bleiben, die Ruhe bewahren, und dafür wurden wir mit dem Tor belohnt"", erklärte Andrich, der in dem 1:1 ""ein vernünftiges Ergebnis fürs Rückspiel"" sieht.\nTrotz aller von den Belgiern auf höchstem Niveau platzierter Hindernisse, zeigte sich der Mittelfeldspieler optimistisch. ""Das ist eine abgezockte Truppe, sie machen es einem nicht einfach. Aber wenn wir unsere Stärken auf den Platz bringen, bin ich zuversichtlich, dass wir weiterkommen."" Wobei es aber ja gerade das Problem darstellt, gegen Union sein eigenes Offensivspiel zu entfalten.\nSo dürfte es auch kommende Woche in Brüssel auf Details ankommen wie das Wirtzsche Parkmanöver oder die Präzision bei aussichtsreichsten Kopfballchancen. Viele solcher Momente dürften die Belgier auch dann nicht zulassen.\nBayer wird das Optimum in die Waagschale werfen müssen, um weiterzukommen. Ob Bayer dabei auf Andrichs Kollegen in der Doppelsechs, Exequiel Palacios, zurückgreifen kann, ist offen. Der Weltmeister musste zur Halbzeit angeschlagen raus, weil die hintere Oberschenkelmuskulatur sich meldete. ""Pala hatte ein ungutes Gefühl, aber nicht, dass etwas gerissen ist. Wir müssen abwarten"", erklärte Xabi Alonso.\nDer Einsatz des zuletzt so formstarken Palacios könnte wie zuletzt auch im Rückspiel ein entscheidendes Detail darstellen, in dem sich die Ausgangsposition gegenüber dem Hinspiel nicht verändert hat. ""Alles ist offen"", weiß der Trainer, der aber genauso den Hunger nach mehr formulierte wie Fernando Carro.

"{'content': 'Lesezeit: 3 min\nLässt Gegner schlecht aussehen und macht die Mitspieler besser: Leverkusens Teenager Florian Wirtz (Zweiter von rechts).\nDer 19-jährige Mittelfeldspieler treibt Leverkusen zu einem 3:1-Erfolg, von seiner Finesse profitiert die gesamte Mannschaft. Trainer Xabi Alonso blickt nun auf eine besondere Statistik - bei der Eintracht ist man arg angefasst.\nVon Milan Pavlovic, Leverkusen\nDie Ansage aus der Redaktion nach dem Pausenpfiff ist klar: eine Ode anstimmen auf Florian Wirtz. Nichts einfacher als das nach einer Vorstellung wie jener beim Spiel zwischen Bayer Leverkusen und Eintracht Frankfurt. Der gerade einmal 19-jährige Feinfuß servierte die beiden ersten Bayer-Tore an diesem gelungenen Nachmittag mit Leichtigkeit - und das in voller Bewegung und trotz der Bedrängnis durch büffelartige Gegenspieler, die wie so viele Gegner versuchten, Wirtz auf den Füßen zu\xa0stehen.\nDabei hätte Wirtz\' Arbeitstag auch schmerzvoll beginnen können. Schon nach neun Sekunden hatte Frankfurts Djibril Sow seine Stollen auf dem Schuh des Nationalspielers platziert. Der blieb einigermaßen unversehrt und fand danach immer neue Schlupflöcher, um sich den Gästen zu entziehen und seine Kollegen in Szene zu\xa0setzen.\nAuch beim mühsamen 1:0 im Breisgau fehlt es den Münchnern an Leichtigkeit. Nach dem Spiel provoziert Joshua Kimmich die gegnerischen Fans - eine Szene, die tief blicken lässt.\n                            \n                                        \u2002\n                                Von Sebastian Leisgang\nBeim 1:0 hatte er schon im Voraus geguckt, ob er Amine Adli mit einem Direktpass in die Gasse schicken könnte. Konnte er. Und so lief Adli ungebremst los - und versenkte den Ball angemessen sehenswert mit dem linken Außenrist knapp über Torwart Kevin Trapp zur Führung ins\xa0Netz.\nSchon nach zehn Minuten war in dieser unterhaltsamen Partie also klar, dass eine kuriose Rekordserie fortgesetzt würde: Zum 76. Mal fand das Duell Leverkusen gegen Frankfurt in der Bundesliga statt, zum 76. Mal würde es keine Nullnummer\xa0geben.\nSchnell, schneller, Diaby: Der französische Stürmer bejubelt sein Tor zum 2:0 - nach einem Pass von Florian Wirtz.\nDie Hauptattraktion blieb aber Wirtz: Der schmückte den Anlass mit einer zweiten Torvorlage. In der 34. Minute tippte er ein Anspiel etwa 30 Meter vor dem gegnerischen Tor kurz an, schaute einmal hoch, sah, wie der flinke Moussa Diaby in den Vollsprint-Modus schaltete und spielte ihm den Ball zwischen zwei Frankfurter Verteidiger in den Lauf - und zwar so, dass sein Mitspieler weder abbremsen noch beschleunigen musste. Der Rest - ein cool platzierter Abschluss ins entfernte Toreck - war pure Freude für den französischen Stürmer\xa0(34.).\nDanach war Wirtz mehrfach knapp dran am lupenreinen Assist-Hattrick, doch entweder verdaddelten seine Mitspieler gute Ideen. Oder Kevin Trapp lenkte einen kaum haltbaren Ball von Adli noch neben den Pfosten (43.). Was bei Wirtz ja gerne übersehen wird: Er schafft es mit seinem Spiel, auch den Kollegen Sicherheit zu geben. Gegen Frankfurt fielen vor allem die Verteidiger Edmond Tapsoba und Jonathan Tah auf, die sich erfolgreich auf den Frankfurter Stürmer Randal Kolo Muani konzentrierten. Auch Torschütze Adli und Stürmer Exequiel Palacios zeigten - inspiriert vom Wirtz-Wirbel - ihr\xa0Können.\nDass es nicht noch mehr nennenswerte Aspekte an Wirtz\' Darbietung gab, lag auch an ihm selbst. Denn wenn es darum ging, selbst zu treffen, wirkte er weniger zielstrebig, was Trapp in der 53. Minute eine weitere Parade ermöglichte. Dennoch sah es lange nach einen Osterspaziergang für den Werksklub aus - auch weil die Frankfurter die Kraft vermissen ließen, die sie in der vergangenen Saison international so furchteinflößend gemacht\xa0hatte.\nFrankfurt wirkte klar unterlegen, bis Bayer 04 die Eintracht einlud, sich vielleicht doch einen völlig unverdienten Punkt zu schnappen. Nach einem kollektiven Aussetzer der Gastgeber beim Anschlusstor durch Sow (74.) ging Leverkusen fast jede Souveränität flöten. Zumal Wirtz in der 77. Minute ausgewechselt wurde. Die Eintracht hatte zwar keine echte Chance mehr zum 2:2, aber das Chaos bei den Leverkusenern war beachtlich - es löste sich erst, als dem eingewechselten Azmoun nach einem Konter das erlösende 3:1 gelang\xa0(90.+5).\nBayer-Trainer Xabi Alonso stapelte danach tief, indem er sagte: ""Wir haben noch nichts geschafft."" Aber das stimmte nicht ganz, denn er hat damit aus seinen 19 Spielen als Coach nun 38 Punkte geholt, also einen glatten Zweier-Schnitt pro Partie - und das trotz anfänglicher Probleme (inklusive eines 1:5 im Hinspiel in\xa0Frankfurt).\nDas bedeutet auch, dass das Team des Spaniers die Frankfurter früher als gedacht von Platz sechs verdrängt hat - vor sechs Spieltagen hatte die Eintracht noch elf Punkte vor Bayer 04 gelegen. Darauf angesprochen, verfinsterte sich die Miene des zuletzt häufig schlecht gelaunten Frankfurter Trainers Oliver Glasner weiter. Dass Mario Götze mal wieder wegen Meckerns verwarnt wurde, weshalb er das nächste Spiel aussetzen muss, war das i-Tüpfelchen auf diesem Nachmittag. ""Sie wollen mich provozieren"", sagte Glasner zu einem Sky-Interviewer und beendete das Gespräch - so wie er bald darauf bei der Pressekonferenz seltsam angefasst reagierte und sagte: ""Ich lasse mich heute nicht provozieren. Ostern ist ein Friedensfest. Ich wünsche Euch allen frohe Ostern mit Euren\xa0Familien.""\nDer Abwehrspieler erlöst die Münchner mit einem Fernschuss, Sadio Mané und Serge Gnabry suchen verzweifelt das Glück - und Kimmich sorgt für eine Rudelbildung nach Schlusspfiff.

Manchmal müssen formschwache Spieler nur die richtige Rolle im Mannschaftsgefüge finden, um aufzublühen. So geschehen zuletzt bei Dortmunds Raphael Guerreiro: Seit BVB-Trainer Edin Terzic den Portugiesen aus der linken Verteidigerposition ins zentrale Mittelfeld gezogen hat, macht dieser vor allem offensiv auf sich aufmerksam.\nNachdem Guerreiro zu Beginn des Monats gegen RB Leipzig (2:1) noch auf der Bank geschmort hatte, drehte er im Revierderby beim FC Schalke 04 (2:2) sowie beim Kantersieg gegen den 1. FC Köln (6:1) auf. Zwei Treffer und drei Vorlagen verzeichnete der 29-Jährige in diesen beiden Bundesliga-Partien, für seine Leistung gegen Schalke wurde er in FUT sogar ins TOTW 20 aufgenommen.\nFolgerichtig hat sich Guerreiro bei der Wahl zum Spieler des Monats (POTM) März der Bundesliga gegen Jeremie Frimpong, Exequiel Palacios (beide Bayer 04 Leverkusen), Omar Marmoush (VfL Wolfsburg), Marius Bülter (FC Schalke 04) und Erhan Masovic (VfL Bochum) durchgesetzt. Viele Fans hatten sich aufgrund des Ausblicks auf enormes Tempo eher Frimpong gewünscht, Guerreiros POTM-Karte hat aber ebenfalls ihre Stärken.\nUnter den Grundattributen stechen das Dribbling (93) und der Pass (92) hervor, einzig die Physis (70) verhindert eine Aufnahme in die sogenannte ""Gullit Gang"" - eine Gruppe von Spielern, deren sechs Hauptwerte in FUT allesamt mindestens 80 Punkte betragen. Beim genaueren Blick auf die Spezialkarte wissen vornehmlich die Beweglichkeit (96), die Balance (96) und die Kurzpässe (94) zu überzeugen.\nGuerreiros POTM-Objekt ist in FUT 23 noch bis zum 6. Mai über den Abschluss einer SBC freizuschalten. Erforderlich sind hierfür zwei Teams mit Gesamtbewertungen von mindestens 83 respektive 84, außerdem werden mindestens ein TOTW-Spieler und ein Bundesliga-Profi benötigt. Laut Futbin kostet die günstigste Lösung der SBC knapp 56.000 Münzen (Stand: 7. April).\nIm Vergleich zu besagter letzter TOTW-Karte hat EA SPORTS zuvorderst die Physis (+8) stark verbessert. Die Defensive (+3) hat trotz des Releases als zentraler Mittelfeldspieler (ZM) das zweithöchste Upgrade erhalten. Die Gesamtbewertung beträgt 89 Punkte, zu den großen Highlights zählt das POTM-Objekt Guerreiros zu diesem fortgeschrittenen Zeitpunkt der FUT-Saison nicht mehr.\nBemerkenswert ist die Tatsache, dass der Wahlsieg des Europameisters von 2016 der dritte POTM-Triumph des BVB in Folge ist. In den ersten beiden Monaten des Jahres hatte sich jeweils Julian Brandt durchgesetzt. Der letzte Spieler des Monats der Bundesliga, der nicht bei Borussia Dortmund unter Vertrag steht, war Serge Gnabry vom FC Bayern München im November 2022.\nDurch seine jüngsten Glanzauftritte hat sich Guerreiro neben der POTM-Wahl auch die Wiederaufnahme der Thematik einer Vertragsverlängerung beim BVB verdient. Galt der Portugiese lange Zeit als Kandidat für einen ablösefreien Abgang im Sommer, so hat Dortmunds Sportdirektor Sebastian Kehl eine Ausweitung der Zusammenarbeit zuletzt nicht ausgeschlossen.\nNiklas Aßfalg\nWeitere Angebote des Olympia-Verlags:'}",Exequiel Palacios,de

El único equipo español en carrera pero a la vez el más ganador del certamen deberá jugar ante la Vecchia Signora de Matías Soulé, Ángel Di María y Matías Soulé; mientras que en el otro duelo se enfrentarán el conjunto en el que milita Paulo Dybala contra el de Exequiel Palacios.\nEl máximo ganador de la historia de la competencia fue demasiado para un elenco inglés dormido que no logró hacer pie en el estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán en ningún momento. El resultado global terminó 5 a 2 luego de un 2 a 2 en Inglaterra (goles de Marcel Sabitzer para los Diablos Rojos y de Harry Maguire y Tyrell Malacia en contra para los Nervionenses) y un contundente 3 a 0 para el equipo local en España (dos tantos de Youssef En-Nesyri y uno de Loic Badé). Así, el conjunto dirigido por José Luis Mendilibar aspirará a meterse en su séptima final de Europa League con una particularidad: ganó las seis que disputó.\nPor otro lado, a la Vecchia Signora le alcanzó un empate 1 a 1 en el Allianz Stadium (anotaciones de Adrien Rabiot para el elenco italiano y de Marcus Edwards para el combinado portugués) para sentenciar la serie 2 a 1 ante el conjunto portugués luego del 1 a 0 como visitante en el encuentro de ida (gol de Frederico Gatti). De esta manera, los dirigidos por Massimiliano Allegri buscan su cuarto título luego de los conseguidos en las temporadas 1976-77, 1989-90 y 1992-93.\nBayer Leverkusen se deshizo con facilidad de Union Saint Gilloise de Bélgica luego de un 5-2 en el global. En el partido de ida disputado en el estadio BayArena de Alemania, igualaron 1 a 1 con tantos de Florian Wirtz para el local y de Victor Boniface para el visitante. En el duelo de vuelta, el equipo dirigido por Xabi Alonso se hizo fuerte de visitante y ganó 4 a 1 con tantos de Jeremie Frimpong, Mitchel Bakker, Moussa Diaby y Adam Hlozek (Casper Terho descontó para los belgas). Busca la segunda copa (levantó el trofeo en la edición de 1987-88).\nEl último equipo en clasificarse a semifinales fue la Loba, que necesitó del tiempo suplementario para eliminar a la única institución de Países Bajos que quedaba en competencia. La serie finalizó 4 a 2 para los dirigidos por José Mourinho, que sueña con levantar su segundo título continental consecutivo (en la última temporada ganó la Conference League). Paulo Dybala convirtió un gol agónico a los 89′ y le dio a su equipo la posibilidad de disputar el tiempo extra, donde fue mucho más que su rival y lo derrotó 4 a 1.\n🤯 𝙎𝙀𝙈𝙄𝙁𝙄𝙉𝘼𝙇𝙄𝙎𝙏𝘼𝙎 🤯🧡❤ @ASRomaEspanol⚫️🔴 @bayer04_es ⚪⚫ @juventusfces🤍❤ @SevillaFC#UEL pic.twitter.com/d4PpNm3Sdw\nLos partidos de ida de cada una de las series se disputarán el 11 de mayo, mientras que los de vuelta se jugarán el 18.

Lo principal es que ganemos”, dice el ofensivo del Bayer Leverkusen Amine Adli acerca de lo que su D.T., Xabi Alonso, transmite a los muchachos en cada entrenamiento. El balance del español de cara al cierre de la presente temporada es a todas luces digno de quitarse el sombrero.\nA la (corta) distancia, el tiempo parece darle la razón al director deportivo de los ""aspirinos”, Simon Rolfes, en su decisión de traer a un poco experimentado Alonso a tomar las riendas de un equipo de las exigencias del Leverkusen. Pero lo del campeón del mundo en 2010 ya es histórico a nivel\xa0club en su primera temporada como director técnico de un equipo de primera división.\nCuando se anunció el relevo de Gerardo Seoane en la dirección técnica del Bayer Leverkusen en octubre pasado, el equipo navegaba sin rumbo en la posición 17 de la tabla general al margen de la jornada ocho. Dos descalabros en tres partidos de Champions League, y el aplastante 4:0 ante el Bayern Múnich en dicha jornada, fueron motivos suficientes para la destitución del suizo en la todavía joven campaña 2022/23. Dicho sea de paso, Alonso no pudo salvar al equipo de la eliminación en Champions.\nTranscurridas 27 fechas, los farmacéuticos contemplan los puestos europeos como una realidad palpable de la mano de Xabi Alonso, artífice de un asombroso repunte que hoy los coloca en la sexta posición de un campeonato en su franja crepuscular a siete jornadas del final. Asimismo, el equipo sigue en la pelea por la Europa League en instancias de cuartos de final.\nCampeón del mundo (2010), doblemente campeón de Europa (2008 y 2012), ganador de Champions League con el Liverpool (2005) y el Real Madrid (2014), y tres veces monarca de Bundesliga con el Bayern Múnich (2015-2017), son los mayúsculos títulos que describen por sí mismos la carrera de Xabi como futbolista, considerado uno de los mejores mediocampistas defensivos de este deporte. Como director técnico, no obstante, nada de esto es certificado de garantía al frente de un equipo.\nY si bien durante su carrera futbolística respondió a las órdenes de sendos mentores (Carlo Ancelotti, José\xa0Mourinho y Pep Guardiola), Alonso ya da muestras de eso que llaman ""tener madera” para dirigir: ningún otro entrenador de Bundesliga en la historia del Bayer Leverkusen tiene un porcentaje de victorias tan alto como el del español (63 %) tras lograr 12 victorias en 19 partidos; las últimas cinco de manera consecutiva. Así, el voto de confianza de la directiva para el exentrenador del segundo equipo de la Real Sociedad va por buen camino.\nFlorian Wirtz (izq.) y Xabi Alonso.\nLas palabras de Armine Adli que enmarcan el inicio de este relato dan cuenta del clima interno por el que atraviesa el equipo de Alonso, quien ha logrado volver a articular el empuje ofensivo del Leverkusen con artistas ofensivos como Jeremy Frimpong, Moussa Diaby, el propio Adli y Florian Wirtz. Este último convertido en el asistidor estrella del equipo en lo que va del año tras superar una grave lesión que lo marginara\xa0también de representar a Alemania en Qatar 2022. Las seis asistencias lo convierten en el mejor al momento, solo por detrás de Raphael Guerreiro del Borussia Dortmund.\nPero ensalzar las recientes victorias consecutivas exige por igual dar reconocimiento al mérito del desarrollo defensivo del equipo, apuntalando la labor de los dos sudamericanos Exequiel Palacios y Piero Hincapié, que desde la media cancha refuerzan y dan estabilidad a la zaga tal cual lo hiciera el propio Xabi. En los cinco triunfos al hilo\xa0solo han recibido\xa0cinco goles en contra.\n""(Xabi) Jugaba en mi posición en aquel momento. Intento aprovechar cada momento con él y aprender siempre de él. Con respeto y trabajo”, reconoce el argentino campeón del mundo, Exequiel Palacios.

"{'content': 'La semana pasada trascendió que la separación de Exequiel Palacios de Yésica Frías tuvo su origen en una presunta infidelidad por parte del mediocampista del Bayer Leverkusen. Luego de las imágenes en las que apareció la modelo Rocío Hrabar en las inmediaciones de la casa matrimonial, las sospechas crecieron aún más. No obstante, la tercera en discordia rompió el silenció y envió un mensaje tajante.\nEl pasado viernes Yanina Latorre informó en LAM (América) que la separación del defensor de la selección argentina se debió al vínculo extramatrimonial que había tenido con una modelo de General Madariaga. En una serie de fotos, la panelista enseñó a la joven con valijas en el barrio alemán en donde se hospeda Palacios. Ante las repercusiones de esta información, Hrabar hizo un descargo público en el que reconoció que visitó a Exequiel pero que simplemente son “amigos”.\nFrías y Palacios se casaron en secreto en 2021, luego de conocerse mediante Instagram. El ex River cosechó fama a medida que pasó el tiempo y que su salto profesional alcanzó Europa. Tras convertirse en campeón del mundo con la albiceleste, el volante quedó expuesto cuatro días atrás con una publicación que Yésica realizó ante sus seguidores, en la cual confirmó la ruptura.\nSin embargo, el trascendido de una amante como culpable de la separación generó la respuesta inmediata de Hrabar. En una conversación por chat con la periodista Agostina Biasatti aclaró los rumores de romance con el futbolista. “Hay que aprender a vivir y dejar vivir. Yo entro a mi casa por la puerta, no por la ventana, y no tengo que saltar ningún portón”, comenzó.\n“La cuenta me la pago siempre. Hay que saber ser agradecidos en la vida, dejar de victimizarse y aprender a soltar cuando las cosas ya no funcionan, sin lastimar a nadie e involucrar familias. Siempre se puede utilizar el tiempo para hacer algo productivo”, señaló Rocío Hrabar.\nEn tanto, reflexionó sobre Palacios: “Él está separado hace cuatro meses. Si me fui con mi maleta fue por respeto, solo soy amiga de él, lo fui a visitar porque estaba en Holanda de vacaciones por mi cumple y él está pasando por una situación difícil y le sigue poniendo garra. Hay que destacar que como jugador la rompe y cuesta mucho trabajo humano y físico llegar a donde llegó. Dejen que cada quien viva su vida íntima tranquilo. Estar loco no es malo, ser hipócrita y mentiroso, sí”.\nLuego del mensaje en el que le describió su parecer a Biasatti, Hrabar publicó en sus redes sociales una imagen junto a quien sería su actual pareja. “Hoy y siempre mi amor”, escribió y etiquetó a la joven que la acompaña, quien a modo de comentario expresó: “Te amo”, con un emoji de anillo. A partir de ello, nacieron diversas especulaciones en torno a que podría ser una simple imagen para camuflar el vínculo de Rocío con Palacios o, más bien, esa sería la prueba fehaciente de que entre ellos solo existe una amistad.\nLa semana pasada mediante Instagram Yésica Frías compartió una serie de historias temporales en donde accedió a que sus seguidores le cuestionen sobre el vínculo amoroso con Exequiel Palacios. A pesar de que esto le habría molestado al futbolista, la empresaria avanzó con su relato.\nEn una de las primeras preguntas, Frías admitió la separación y no dejó dudas sobre el motivo. “Me demostró lo que realmente es. Yo estuve con él en su peor momento y él en el mío me soltó la mano”, lanzó. En esa misma línea, adhirió a la picante pregunta de un usuario: “¿Creés que ahora por ser ganador del Mundial se la creyó y se olvidó quién es?”. “Lo dijiste vos”, respondió junto con un emoji de una boca cerrada con un cierre.\nPor otro lado, minutos más tarde llegó otro comentario que apuntó contra Palacios al que ella adhirió. “Pensar que dejaste tu vida y tu familia por él y así te agradece”, le comentó alguien y ella no dudó en darle la razón: “Viste vos, así son”.\nCopyright 2023 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados'}",Exequiel Palacios,es

"{'content': 'Untold Arsenal: Supporting the club, the manager and the team\n""I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art.""  A Wenger\n\n\nBy Bulldog Drummond\nArsenal may have been through their one and only dip of the season, with three draws and a defeat in the last four games, but by comparison Chelsea’s dip has been on another planet when it comes to dips.\nAnd in case you have not been following the evolution of this very simple theory, it says that teams that aim to challenge for the top four places, but then fail, don’t just lose the occasional match, but have runs of three or four results in which they perform more like clubs from the lower part of\xa0 the division.\nLast season Arsenal had four of these runs last season, the final one causing them to end up fifth rather than fourth.\xa0 This season there has just been the one such run, which we have just been through and which hopefully is now over.\xa0 \xa0And we have been able to see the same pattern with other clubs – they get into a run where they are drawing with or losing to teams we would normally expect them to beat.\nThe theory is of interest not just because it does neatly describe what happens, but also because it focuses on the difficulty clubs can have of getting out of a negative run – as indeed we have just seen with Arsenal.\xa0 \xa0But\xa0Chelsea however have taken this simple notion to a new level:\nSo Chelsea are on a bad run but it is worth noting that although Arsenal have been having a hard time of late, the points picked up from the last six home game work out at 2.17 points per game compared with 2.44 across the season as a whole.\xa0 Not as good as before, but hardly a disaster.\nChelsea on the other hand are actually doing worse than their average for the season in the last six away games they have played picking up 0.83 points per game as opposed to 1.07 points per away game across the whole season.\nIn short, a good run at home this season, which has dipped very slightly of late for Arsenal, and for Chelsea a bad run away this season, which has dipped very slightly of late – and this despite spending more in the January transfer window than any other club.\nWhich takes us away from our theory of dips into the notion that clubs can improve their performance by spending money on players is a fallacy.\xa0 Sometimes it works, but often not, as we can see by comparing the position of clubs in the league with their total transfer spend through last summer and this January combined.\xa0 Figures compiled from Squawka from raw data provided by TransferMarkt.\nWhat we have added to this data are three new columns at the end.\nFirst: a “spend position” which simply takes the club that has the highest net spend (Chelsea) down to the club that has the highest net earnings (Brighton).\nSecond: the actual league position\nThird: the difference between the two.\xa0 \xa0Here a minus figure shows the club is doing worse than we might have expected given their position in the spending charts, while a positive figure shows they are doing better than we might expect\n\nSo Arsenal are four places higher than we would expect if spending on new players equalled success in the league.\xa0 Chelsea are 11 places worse off than we might expect.\xa0 The other big losers are Nottingham Forest, West Ham United and Southampton.\nThe big winners are Manchester City and Brighton.\xa0 Man C are obviously benefitting by having spent the Abu Dhabi billions year after year already.\xa0 Brighton are… well, doing extraordinarily well having lost players and a manager.\nThis is not to say that all spending is pointless, but rather than as a solution on its own it doesn’t always work.\xa0 Although Everton and Leicester City are in dire trouble near the foot of the table, they have in fact received transfer money rather than spent it, which shows other factors are of course in play – I am not suggesting they are not.\xa0 \xa0Leicester, in particular, had a tactic that refs let go, but eventually caught up on.\nRather I am simply pointing out that spend-spend-spend does not mean success.\xa0 To see this we might look at the case of Mykhaylo Mudryk.\xa0 After the big fight to get him, it seems that Chelsea have decided he can now leave the club in a swap deal with AC Milan maybe for Ruben Loftus-Cheek or Kalidou Koulibaly (according to the Express)\nIn 2022/23 Mudryk scored 10 goals in 18 games with Shakhtar Donetsk.\xa0 With Chelsea, it has been 0 goals in 13.\xa0 \xa0Did Arsenal ever really want him?\xa0 Personally, I think not, but others disagree.\xa0 He cost Chelsea £88.5m.\n\nSpending is not a solution in and of itself, but it helps.\nYour email address will not be published.

"{'content': 'Craig Burley debates whether Frank Lampard will ever secure another permanent managerial role in the Premier League. (0:46)\nIt\'s been an odd soccer season in Europe, and not just because it was interrupted by a World Cup in November and December. The Champions League has given us dollops of parity: take Barcelona and Atletico Madrid bombing out in the group stage while Club Brugge advanced, Napoli looking like the best team in Europe for months (and Serie A placing three teams in the quarterfinals and two in the semis like it\'s 2003 all over again or something), last year\'s finalist Liverpool failing quickly and quietly, 2020 finalists Bayern and PSG basically doing the same, and so on. Meanwhile, Bayern is threatening to end its 10-year Bundesliga title streak and Arsenal has spent most of the season atop the Premier League table like it\'s 2004 all over again or something.\nAs tends to be the case, though, order begins to shine through chaos toward the end of the season. The best team in Europe (Manchester City) and the tournament\'s most frequent winner (Real Madrid) remain in the hunt for the Champions League crown, and City has solid odds of winning England\'s first treble (the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League titles) since 1999. PSG is going to win Ligue 1 yet again, Bayern could still win the Bundesliga, and Barcelona has just about polished off its first LaLiga title since 2019.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nWhile we wait to see how much competitive balance the soccer gods elect to share with us, we\'re also awash in post-mortems. A number of the world\'s more successful and/or monied clubs are already out of the Champions League running, and some have suffered dour league form as well. The present tense still has plenty of questions to answer, but let\'s look into the future a bit, as well.\nFor the 12 teams thus far eliminated from the Champions League knockout rounds, what questions await as they attempt to prepare for greater success moving forward?\nLast season: Third place (74 points, +43 goal differential), eliminated by Real Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals\nThis season: 11th place (on pace for 46 points and -6 goal differential), eliminated by Real Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals\nMost immediate issue to address: goals, obviously. For the comprehensiveness of Chelsea\'s collapse in 2022-23, it\'s mostly shown up on one side of the ledger. The Blues have still allowed the fourth-fewest goals and fifth-lowest xG averages, and while those aren\'t the greatest numbers this club has ever produced, it\'s not the problem.\nThe problem is that they\'re 14th in goals scored. Forwards Kai Havertz and Joao Felix have been mired in dreadful finishing slumps -- they\'ve combined for 11 goals from shots worth 18.44 xG this season -- but even if they were finishing at proper levels and had seven more goals between them, Chelsea would still only be 13th in scoring. The main problem has been the attack itself, not the finishing.\nEven with Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner suffering through their own issues, Chelsea was still third in Premier League scoring last season; it sent both of those forwards away (Werner permanently, Lukaku on loan) and spent a market-redefining amount on a new team, and is averaging less than half the goals. The Blues have fallen from fourth in shots per possession to ninth and from seventh in xG per shot to 15th.\nRB Leipzig\'s Christopher Nkunku will arrive this summer, and the club has added five players -- including Raheem Sterling and the extremely expensive Mykhaylo Mudryk -- via transfer, plus Felix on loan. They still have Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech. In theory, this summer will be about thinning the attacker crop a good amount, crafting something cohesive out of what\'s left and then ceasing with the transfers for a while. This isn\'t Football Manager!\nLast season: second place (92 points, +68 goal differential), eliminated by Real Madrid in the Champions League final\nThis season: six place (on pace for 63 points, +26 goal differential), eliminated by Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: defensive resistance. In 63 matches last season, Liverpool allowed opponents 471 total shots, 65 worth at least 0.3 xG. In just 45 matches this season it has allowed 468 and 61, respectively.\nWhen Liverpool has struggled in the past under Jurgen Klopp, however briefly, it was almost always because opponents were creating too many high-quality looks in transition. It\'s the risk of Klopp\'s high-wire, risk-reward pressing approach. As tends to be the case, Liverpool is allowing the highest xG per shot average in the Premier League this season, but any attempts at limiting shot quantity has fallen apart.\nLiverpool defense, 2021-22 (all competitions): 0.76 goals allowed per game, 1.02 xG allowed, 0.075 shots allowed per possession, 0.137 xG allowed per shot\nLiverpool defense, 2022-23 (all competitions): 1.29 goals allowed per game, 1.42 xG allowed, 0.110 shots allowed per possession, 0.137 xG allowed per shot\nThat\'s a 70% increase in goals allowed and a 39% increase in xG, all with the same shot quality. Liverpool\'s entire defensive apparatus has grown creaky, and the club has allowed the midfield to get particularly old. While it spent €137 million in transfer fees this season, roughly €122m of that went toward acquiring attackers Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo.\nRebuilds can be clunky and discontinuous -- you don\'t perfectly address your needs in the exact order that they need to be addressed -- but while Nunez and Gakpo could form a devastating scoring tandem for the next great Liverpool squad, the club has some overdue needs to address before said greatness can occur.\nLet\'s see what midfielders it brings in this summer, and let\'s see how much of an immediate effect the additions have.\nLast season: fourth place (71 points, +29 goal differential), eliminated in the Conference League group stage\nThis season: seventh place (on pace for 63 points, +8 goal differential), eliminated by AC Milan in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: a future identity (one that actually sticks). One minute into the USA Network broadcast of Sunday\'s Tottenham-Newcastle match, the announcer was declaring this a make-or-break week for Spurs, who also play Manchester United on Thursday and at Liverpool on Sunday. As he was saying this, Newcastle scored its first goal. It scored again four, seven, 17 and 19 minutes later on the way to a stunning 6-1 win.\nGab Marcotti and Julien Laurens discuss Tottenham\'s disastrous 6-1 loss to Newcastle in the Premier League.\nSpurs have become the perfect example of why you shouldn\'t let a new managerial hire dictate too much of your transfer philosophy. The starting lineup that got so completely destroyed on Sunday featured one player who made his Spurs debut under Harry Redknapp, one who did so under Andre Villas-Boas, three who did so under Mauricio Pochettino, one who was acquired during the extremely brief Nuno Espirito Santo era and four who were acquired for Antonio Conte. Those are all very, very different managers.\nPochettino\'s Spurs reached the Champions League final and earned three straight Premier League top-three finishes with an aggressive, proactive, possession-heavy approach. When that burned out, Spurs hired three straight managers who play more reactive, counterattacking ball (but only after considering managers with completely different styles first).\nDespite the successes on Conte\'s résumé, his version of reactive ball grew less and less successful over time. Tottenham ranks 17th in shots allowed per possession this season; Spurs also rank second in xG allowed per shot, but when you\'re giving opponents that many opportunities, and when your goalkeepers rank 13th in save percentage, you\'re going to allow too many goals.\nI\'m not sure what style would work best for Spurs moving forward, but they\'ve wasted the past few years of Harry Kane\'s prime, refusing to ship him to another club for huge money while failing to craft anything cohesive around him. They need to actually craft a future vision and build around it, and thanks to the past few years of decision-making, it\'s hard to be confident in their ability to pull that off.\nLast season: first place (77 points, +60 goal differential), eliminated by Villarreal in the Champions League quarterfinals\nThis season: second place (on pace for 69 points, +54 goal differential), eliminated by Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals\nMost immediate issue to address: shot quality. Over its past six matches, Bayern has won only once, drawn twice, lost three times, found itself eliminated from both the Champions League and DFB-Pokal and has fallen to second in the Bundesliga race. This all came after it inexplicably panic-fired manager Julian Nagelsmann, who had lost just three times in the season\'s first seven months.\nOn one hand, you could say Bayern has been unlucky -- in these six matches, it scored five goals from 102 shots worth 12.1 xG, a dreadful finishing funk that won\'t last. On the other hand, xG averages aren\'t all the same. The higher percentage of particularly high-quality shots you create, the more likely you are to score, and Bayern is creating fewer high-quality looks than ever. Last year in all competitions, 13.9% of its shots were worth at least 0.3 xG; this season it\'s just 9.6%, and it\'s been just 6.9% in these dismal six games.\nThis is what happens when you lose Robert Lewandowski and replace him with a natural winger (Sadio Mane) and a 17-year-old (Mathys Tel).\nRobert Lewandowski, 2021-22: 4.5 shots per 90 minutes, 28% worth 0.3 xG or more\nSadio Mane, 2022-23: 3.2 shots per 90, 16% worth 0.3 xG or more\nMathys Tel, 2022-23: 4.9 shots per 90, 0.11 xG per shot, 0% worth 0.3 xG or more\nLewandowski was responsible for a large percentage of the team\'s high-quality looks in recent years, as tends to be the case with star center-forwards. Without him, Bayern\'s attack has remained ultra-talented, but aside from when former Lewandowski backup Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has been healthy and hot, the attack has had no natural center of gravity. (The 34-year old has played only three matches, with zero goals, since March 8.) This was the case with Nagelsmann, and it has been the case thus far with replacement Thomas Tuchel.\nWith Bayern losing its composure both in the boardroom (with the recent panic move) and locker room (with the dust-up between stars), it will be interesting to see whether the club digs itself more of a hole or if it quickly rights the ship. Shot quality isn\'t its lone deficiency, but if it can add an excellent center-forward this summer -- Napoli\'s Victor Osimhen? Eintracht Frankfurt\'s Randal Kolo Muani? -- a lot of those other issues will take care of themselves.\nLast season: second place (69 points, +33 goal differential), eliminated by Rangers in the Europa League round of 24\nThis season: first place (on pace for 70 points, +32 goal differential), eliminated by Chelsea in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: defensive passivity. BVB is on pace to almost perfectly match last year\'s point total and goal differential, but it\'s in first place now because of Bayern\'s regression. Still, it had Erling Haaland last year and has battled a steady stream of injuries and illness this season, so the fact that it\'s on a similar pace is an accomplishment.\nThe Borussia attack has not been as explosive this season -- to be expected considering the loss of Haaland and the absence of replacement Sebastien Haller for the first few months -- but despite a couple of costly blown leads that have prevented it from being comfortably ahead in the table, the defense as a whole has significantly cut the breakdowns. It has gone from allowing 0.139 xG per shot in 2021-22, a Liverpool-esque worst in the Bundesliga, to allowing just 0.104, ranking  second.\nOpponents are attempting 53% of their shots in the box (12th) and averaging 0.13 shots per possession (10th), however, and this passivity was magnified in the Champions League, where opponents averaged 0.16 shots per possession. Goalkeeper Gregor Kobel played brilliantly (81.0 save percentage in the Champions League), but elite opponents are still too comfortable and settled in attack, and BVB will likely have to improve on that without star midfielder Jude Bellingham next season.\nThere are two directions BVB could go from here. Either it commits to a reactive, counterattacking approach -- and with winger Karim Adeyemi\'s speed, that isn\'t entirely unattractive -- or it does what Borussia Dortmund tends to do: attack. With the money it would get from a potential Bellingham transfer, it would need to seek out players (midfielders in particular) who can put pressure on opponents and make them more uncomfortable in buildup if it wants to advance further in Europe.\nLast season: third place (58 points, +35 goal differential), eliminated by Rangers in the Europa League semifinals\nThis season: fifth place (on pace for 60 points, +19 goal differential), eliminated by Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: What does it mean to be a modern German club in 2023-24? Bundesliga teams have learned to defend in 2022-23. Well, sort of. Scoring averages have barely changed, but the average Bundesliga team attempted 72% of its shots with at least two defenders between the shooter and goal last season, and that\'s up to 82% this season. The best teams aren\'t finding as much success with aggression and full-pitch pressure, and that has sort of left RB Leipzig -- a team stylistically designed to be the most German of German teams -- in a bit of a bind.\n\nThe beautiful game lives here.

That\'s somewhat understandable considering star Christopher Nkunku\'s injury issues, but he has gone after this year anyway, so it has to figure out how to better create opportunities moving forward.\nLeipzig also needs much, much better goalkeeping. It has lost 11 matches this season, and in nine of them, its goalkeeper was in the negative in goals prevented (the difference between goals allowed and the post-shot xG value of the shots on target that he faced). It is eighth in the league in goals prevented this season and 15th in save percentage. Peter Gulacsi has missed much of the season with a torn ACL, but he had a dreadful 50% save percentage before his injury, and backup Janis Blaswich is at only 63%. They are also 32 and 31 years old, respectively.\nA refresh is probably needed.\nLast season: 11th place (42 points, -4 goal differential), won the Europa League\nThis season: ninth place (on pace for 49 points, +5 goal differential), eliminated by Napoli in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: depth. It was forgivable last season, when Eintracht faded dismally in league play while focusing entirely on its miraculous Europa League run. It won it and therefore qualified for the Champions League, so it didn\'t matter that it only pulled 11 points from its last 13 Bundesliga matches.\nIt matters a bit more that it has pulled only four points from its past eight matches this season. Eintracht reached the Champions League knockout stages -- its best performance in Europe\'s biggest competition in 63 years -- during a solid fall run, but it bowed out meekly against Napoli and, with help from injuries, it seems to have completely run out of gas.\nWith this season\'s Champions League revenue -- plus the funds from a potential transfer for star Randal Kolo Muani if it is unable to keep him -- Eintracht simply needs to add more capable bodies.\nIt also needs a more balanced midfield. It has crafted an odd style under Oliver Glasner -- one too direct to be a possession team, but not nearly direct enough to sport a defense-and-countering identity. It ranks 15th out of 18 in the Bundesliga in shots per possession, and in what I define as ""transition possessions"" (possessions that start outside the attacking third and last 20 or fewer seconds), it ranks 11th in goals allowed.\nIt really feels like an upgrade is needed in central midfield. Sebastian Rode (1,773 minutes in all competitions) is 32 years old, and Daichi Kamada (2,830 minutes) is out of contract this summer. Djibril Sow is solid, but needs more sturdy help, as Glasner\'s attack-minded 3-4-2-1 formation has resulted in a little too much stress and midfield isolation in a Bundesliga less vulnerable to pressing and attack.\nLast season: third place (79 points, +43 goal differential), eliminated by Barcelona in the Europa League round of 24\nThis season: first place (on pace for 96 points, +56 goal differential), eliminated by AC Milan in the Champions League quarterfinals\nMost immediate issue to address: again, depth. It feels odd to put the soon-to-be Scudetto winners -- their magic number for clinching their first Serie A title in 33 years is down to four points -- on any sort of ""disappointments"" list. But for as grand as the celebrations will be when they eventually clinch the title, their form indeed suffered just enough this spring to remind us that they aren\'t yet a finished product.\nAfter losing only twice in all competitions before March, Napoli dropped league matches to Lazio (March 3) and a 4-0 whopper to AC Milan (April 2), as well as suffering through a scoreless draw with relegation-threatened Hellas Verona on April 15. Meanwhile, with star forward Osimhen battling back from injury, its nearly flawless Champions League run was also stopped by Milan, which won 1-0 at home and survived a 1-1 draw in Naples.\nStill, there\'s been obvious evolution in nearly every statistical category this season, and a lot of it stems from a nearly perfect set of summer 2022 transfers. The addition of Khvicha ""Kvaradona"" Kvaratskhelia had obvious effects -- he has 14 goals and 14 assists in all competitions -- but the team also added immediate stalwarts in defender Kim Min-Jae from Fenerbahce and midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa from Fulham. Keeping on-loan forward Giovanni Simeone from Hellas could be vital if the club ends up biting on a big transfer offer for Osimhen.\nNo one gets A+ transfer-window grades year after year, but clubs like Liverpool and AC Milan have proved that if you can nail a couple in a row, you can completely transform your club. Napoli is not yet a finished product from a depth perspective, but it is one more great summer away from another potential Scudetto and Champions League run.\nLast season: first place (86 points, +54 goal differential), eliminated by Real Madrid in Champions League round of 16\nThis season: first place (on pace for 89 points, +52 goal differential), eliminated by Bayern in Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: What does PSG want to be? Ligue 1 has been particularly watchable this season, but in a sea of fun middleweights, the team with Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and a sometimes-healthy Neymar is going to once again run away with the title, just as it did (with almost identical rate stats) last season. Neither familiar contenders like Marseille and Monaco nor the rising Lens could avoid potholes, and PSG was once again too talented for France and too imbalanced for a Champions League run.\nNo matter who suits up next season, PSG will be the favorite once again. That\'s the way Ligue 1 works right now. But while the big summer story in Paris could be Messi\'s likely departure after just two seasons, and the Mbappe transfer rumor industry is always looking for just a single shred of a reason to kick into fifth gear, there\'s still a long-term building project to watch. Sporting director Luis Campos has been on the job for only a year, and he completely transformed PSG\'s aging midfield, adding the likes of Vitinha (23 years old), Nuno Mendes (20), Fabian Ruiz (27), Carlos Soler (26) and Nordi Mukiele (25), who have combined for nearly 10,000 minutes at midfield and wingback this season. Warren Zaire-Emery, just 17 years old, has also contributed 738 minutes.\nWith goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and Mbappe (if he remains in Paris) still only 24 years old, it\'s easy to see the core of a particularly special team developing over time, at least if this consistently stressed-out club can maintain a long-term vision. But a patient plan is difficult to execute, and the growing frustration of increasingly meek European performances certainly clouds said future at the moment.\nLast season: third place in the Primeira Liga (74 points, +48 goal differential), eliminated by Ajax in the Champions League round of 16\nThis season: first place (on pace for 87 points, +61 goal differential), eliminated by Inter in the Champions League quarterfinals\nMost immediate issue to address: Keeping Goncalo Ramos. We know how things tend to work for Portugal\'s top clubs in the overall European food chain: Play quality ball, succeed domestically, acquit yourself well (but not too well) in the Champions League and send your best players to bigger clubs, usually in the Premier League.\nDan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\nIn the past 12 months alone, Benfica has sold the rights to forward Darwin Nunez (to Liverpool last summer) and midfielder Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea in January) for a combined €201m. It managed to improve significantly without Nunez, thanks in part to thriving newcomers in manager Roger Schmidt and Fernandez, added from River Plate; it lost only one of its first 26 league matches and topped PSG for first place in their Champions League group. Benfica held on for a while after losing Fernandez, too, throttling a punch-less Club Brugge in the Champions League round of 16 and winning all six league matches in February and March.\nApril, however, has been rough. It lost to Porto and Chaves in the league and couldn\'t keep up with Inter in the Champions League quarters. Its league lead, once huge, is down to four points.\nBenfica will have another shot at particularly strong ball next year, but it will probably require holding onto 21-year-old forward Goncalo Ramos, a.k.a. the primary reason it was so strong without Nunez, who has scored 24 goals in all competitions this season. Benfica will be as good as normal without him, but it could be special if he stays in Lisbon for one more season.\nLast season: first place in the Primeira Liga (91 points, +64 goal differential), eliminated by Lyon in the Europa League round of 16\nThis season: second place (on pace for 82 points, +50 goal differential), eliminated by Inter in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: the balance between veterans and young star power. Porto lost Vitinha to PSG and Fabio Viera to Arsenal and fell behind a torrid Benfica in the fall. It looked like the league race was lost, but it has pulled 19 points from seven matches to pull within four points; it also outplayed Inter for large portions of their Champions League tie, but somehow none of its 31 shot attempts, worth a combined 3.5 xG, found the net. Poor finishing, plus 10 saves from Inter\'s Andre Onana, doomed Porto.\nPorto has been better than Benfica this spring, but the two rivals\' futures are awfully similar. Porto has a lot of players bigger clubs will come after in the near future -- goalkeeper Diogo Costa and forward Evanilson, to name two -- but is a bit more veteran-heavy than Benfica as well. That probably gives it both a higher floor (good for future league finishes) and a lower ceiling (bad for future Champions League runs). Porto might be pretty content with that trade-off, but it will probably take another young star or two to make it past the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time since 2004.\nLast season: first place in the Jupiler Pro League (72 points, +35 goal differential in regular season; 14 points, +6 goal differential in championship playoff), eliminated in the Champions League group stage\nThis season: fourth place (59 points, +25 goal differential) heading into championship playoff, eliminated by Benfica in the Champions League round of 16\nMost immediate issue to address: What the hell happened this year? The uncharacteristic highs of September and October were quickly followed by uncharacteristic lows.\nThe three-time defending Belgian champions were the story of the early Champions League group stage, parlaying consecutive wins over Bayer Leverkusen, Porto and Atletico Madrid -- by a combined 7-0, no less! -- into a knockout stage appearance, their best showing in Europe\'s biggest tournament since they reached the finals 45 years ago.\nThe good results almost immediately ceased. Brugge\'s final five Champions League matches featured two nil-nil draws and three losses by a combined 11-1. In November, it embarked on a run of 15 league matches with just 17 points. It fired manager Carl Hoefkens in December ... and then fired replacement Scott Parker in March. It hasn\'t finished worse than third in the Jupiler Pro League since 2011, and this year appears destined for fourth.\nWhat exactly happened? Did the intriguing balance between the extreme veteran presence of players like goalkeeper Simon Mignolet (35 years old), fullback Denis Odoi (34) and midfielder Hans Vanaken (30), and youngsters like fullback Bjorn Meijer (20), defender Abakar Sylla (20) and midfielder Raphael Onyedika (22) fall out of whack? Was the attack, centered around former Barcelona prospect Ferran Jutgla, a bit too one-dimensional? Brugge has a bit of roster sprucing to do, and will be undergoing it in some competition other than the Champions League next season.'}",Mykhaylo Mudryk,en

"{'content': 'Editions:\nEn/football/chelsea\nThe Blues have been struggling this season\nReal Madrid dealt a major blow to Chelsea as Los Blancos eliminated the Blues from the Champions League quarter-finals after beating them 4-0 on aggregate.\nTodd Boehly landed at Stamford Bridge as a sports guru and his experience at the two-time European champions is starting to border on disaster.\nThere are two sides to Boehly. In the United States, he owns the MLB side Los Angeles Dodgers. He took over, along with a prestigious investment group, in the midst of bankruptcy.\nThe franchise got back on its feet and the results are backing the project. They bought the team in 2012 and made them champions of 2020 World Series.\nUnder Boehly\'s management, the Dodgers became playoff regulars, reached three finals and won one.\nHowever, Chelsea is the opposite case. They have been eliminated from all the competitions they competed in and they struggle in the Premier League, where they are expected to miss out on European qualification for next season.\nBoehly has already invested as many as 600 million dollars in players at Chelsea. He has done the same at the Dodgers, with chief operating officer Andrew Friedman being the basic pillar of his project.\nFriedman joined the club in 2014 and the team spent 108 million dollars in payroll the year that they won the title.\n""Payrolls don\'t decide the standings, and I think we see evidence of that every year,"" Friedman said.\n""Having a really deep and talented roster regardless of what your payroll is is the key to winning games, and that\'s what they have. And it\'s been through a lot of very shrewd moves, some through the draft, some through trades and all kinds of different creative ways of player procurement.""\nHe signed Mookie Betts on a 12-year, 365 million dollar deal and the Dodgers star led the team to glory, also winning the MVP prize.\nMeanwhile, Chelsea have spent big in several players such as Enzo Fernandez, Mykhaylo Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Benoit Badiashile and David Fofana.\n""I think the first step has been made. An incorrect step, but it has been made,"" Thiago Silva told TNT Sports after the elimination at the hands of Real Madrid.\n""It\'s a hard period for the club, with a lot of indecision. Change of ownership, new players arriving - we had to increase the size of the changing room because it didn\'t fit the size of the squad.\n""A positive point is that there are amazing players in the squad, but on the other hand there are always players that are going to be unhappy. There is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play. The manager can only pick 11 from a squad of 30-something - that\'s tough.\n""Some can\'t make the squad, we signed eight in January, we need to stop and put a strategy in place otherwise next season we could make the same mistakes.""\nSuccess was achieved at the Dodgers by following the so-called Moneyball approach from top to bottom. They remodelled their stadium and followed Friedman\'s fundaments of evaluation and player development. The Dodgers bet on nutrition, new coaches, mental ability development and statistical and biomechanical analysts.\nHowever, the Blues are constantly making changes by either firing coaches or bringing in more players.\n""I knew this club with a certain class during the Abramovich era, but today I find it lacking. It\'s very hard for me to see how they got rid of certain people,"" club legend Didier Drogba said.\n""They should go back to the principles and values they had.\n""I don\'t recognise my club. It\'s no longer the same club, There is a new owner and a new vision.\n""Of course, we try to compare it with what happened during the (Roman) Abramovich era where a lot of players were brought in, but the decisions were very intelligent.\n©  Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

The additions of Leandro Trossard and Jorginho in January have given more depth to the team, too, as Arsenal target a first title in 19 years this term.\nAccording to rumours, however, Arteta is not satisfied with his squad and wants to bring in reinforcements this summer.

He is still available, having been out of work since being sacked by Paris St-Germain.\nAs disclosed by Telegraph Sport, Tottenham have made moves to contact Enrique and it appears the north London club might have a clear run at him with Chelsea’s attention focused more vividly elsewhere.\nChairman Daniel Levy has previously expressed reservations over Enrique’s lack of Premier League experience, but the Spaniard has been highly recommended to Spurs and is on the club’s shortlist of candidates to permanently succeed Antonio Conte.\nDespite their elimination from the Champions League, the Chelsea job is still rated as one of the most attractive in Europe, but Boehly and Eghbali know they cannot afford to get their next appointment wrong.\nBoehly and Eghbali have already sacked Thomas Tuchel and Potter, and put Frank Lampard in caretaker charge until the end of the season, inside 12 months.\nBut, following the Champions League defeat by Real Madrid, defender Thiago Silva warned: “Everybody talks too much about replacing managers. I think we, as players, must also take responsibility.\n“We have had three managers this season, plus a fourth with Bruno where we failed to win. We have lost today and with Lampard, we have failed to win. Everybody is talking about the manager but we must look at what has been done wrong and try to change.\n“I think the first step has been made; an incorrect step, but it has been made. We can’t be blaming the managers if we don’t take responsibility. It’s a hard period for the club, with a lot of indecision.\n“Change of ownership, new players arriving – we had to increase the size of the changing room because it didn’t fit the size of the squad.\n“A positive point is that there are amazing players in the squad, but on the other hand there are always players that are going to be unhappy. There is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play. The manager can only pick 11 from a squad of 30-something – that’s tough.\n“Some can’t make the squad, we signed eight in January, we need to stop and put a strategy in place otherwise next season we could make the same mistakes.”\nChelsea’s Champions League exit has left some players facing the prospect of pay cuts of up to 30 per cent, while others will not see their wages immediately hit by a failure to qualify for the competition should they stay at the club.\nThe Boehly-Clearlake Capital owners introduced a bonus system after buying Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, who only paid bonuses for winning trophies and did not include Champions League reduction clauses in contracts.\nHaving spent £600 million in the past two transfer windows, the move to insert Champions League clauses will help offset some of the costs of not playing in Europe’s top competition, although some of the cuts may be deferred past next season.\nA number of players who joined Chelsea or who have signed new contracts since the takeover agreed to a variable salary scheme that saw a portion of their wages, as much as 30 per cent in some cases, tied to Champions League qualification.\nBut those still on contracts agreed under the Abramovich regime are guaranteed their full wages should they stay at the club this summer without signing new deals, despite Chelsea’s dismal season in which qualification for the Champions League has now become impossible.\nBig earners from the Abramovich era include Kepa Arrizabalaga, Kai Havertz, Mateo Kovacic, Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic and N’Golo Kante, who has been in negotiations over an extension to his contract past the end of this season.\nIt is expected that any of the players from the Abramovich era who sign new contracts at Chelsea in the future will have to agree to the Champions League clause, so that the reductions impact the entire squad when the full transition period between ownerships has come to an end.\nChelsea have signed 12 senior players on permanent contracts since the Boehly-Clearlake takeover, including January recruits Enzo Fernandez, Mykhaylo Mudryk, Benoit Badiashile, Noni Madueke, David Datro Fofana and Malo Gusto, who will not be available to play until next season. Silva, Reece James, Cesar Azpilicueta, Ben Chilwell, Trevoh Chalobah, Armando Broja and Marcus Betinelli have all signed new contracts since the change of ownership.\nThe two RBs drafted in Round 1 stand alone when it comes to clear fantasy value.

An incorrect step, but it has been made,’ Silva began.\n‘We can’t be blaming the managers if we don’t take responsibility. It’s a hard period for the club, with a lot of indecision.\n'Change of ownership, new players arriving – we had to increase the size of the changing room because it didn’t fit the size of the squad.'\nSilva's reference of space issues for Chelsea's unwieldy 30-plus squad was previously reported by Mail Sport, after it emerged in the wake of the sacking of former manager Graham Potter that due to the influx of players during the January window, some were forced to get changed in the corridors at Cobham.\nThe former Paris Saint-Germain defender stressed that although this meant there were 'amazing players', there would always be some that were 'unhappy' with their playing time.\n‘There is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play,' Silva went on.\n‘The manager can only pick 11 from a squad of 30-something – that’s tough.\n‘Some can’t make the squad, we signed eight in January, we need to stop and put a strategy in place otherwise next season we could make the same mistakes.’\nDespite the influx of players in west London, Silva frequently makes the Blues' starting XI\nNew recruits Joao Felix, Mykhaylo Mudryk and Raheem Sterling were three of the Boehly-era players to make an appearance at Stamford Bridge\nChelsea's selection issues were dissected by the pundits on BT Sport during Tuesday's match, with Michael Owen calling owner Todd Boehly's failure to sign a striker during his £600million spree 'one of the biggest mysteries of all time'.\nOut-of-favour target-man Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was signed to set up a reunion with his former Borussia Dortmund coach Tuchel – days before the German was sacked – was left of out of Chelsea's Champions League squad ahead of their first quarter-final tie against Real Madrid.\nAs the Blues are said to be narrowing their focus to the appointment of Julian Nagelsmann as Potter's long-term replacement, Silva pointed out that a change in manager would not be a catch-all solution.\n‘Everybody talks too much about replacing managers.

"{'content': ""Real Madrid just had to be good enough against opponents resembling a sinking vessel peopled by castaways\nWell, there goes the season. Perhaps summer budget too. Who knows maybe the entire Chelsea 3.0 Blue Sky Project Stage One?\nWith 28 minutes to go in a Champions League second leg Chelsea always seemed to be losing, even when they were threatening vaguely to win it, the home bench took a deep breath, cleared its throat, and coughed up £260m of randomly assembled attacking talent.\nAdmittedly Chelsea were 3-0 down in the tie by the time Raheem Sterling, João Félix and Mykhaylo Mudryk came on to the pitch, having spent an hour playing with five defenders and three defensive midfielders, one of them installed as an assiduous and energetic No 10-cum-right-winger.\nAnd yes, by that point this thrillingly overmanned attacking machine had mustered a single goal in its last 510 minutes of football. But hey: Boehly-ball. Go with it. Disrupt. Subvert the dominant paradigm. Storm the dressing room. Anything to keep away the gathering sense of quiet horror around this whole grand, baffling, viciously wasteful football-style project.\nThis was a strange football match. There is something sad, but also grotesque about seeing this Chelsea team toiling through their patterns, all mangled shapes and blocked talent. Nothing here feels permanent or stitched together, or put in place with any skill or love. We are the hollow men. We are the stuffed men. We are the human spoils of Todd Boehly’s incoherent acquisitiveness, the top down confusion as to how this complex and heavily ritualised sport actually works.\nFor all that Chelsea did also play well here. Stamford Bridge was boisterously full, those low white midweek lights conjuring the muscle memory of more coherent times, of teams that looked like teams, of some guiding intelligence behind this 25-year project team. There were key missed chances before Madrid took the lead. The ball kept falling to N’Golo Kanté close to goal, but then this will happen if you select N’Golo Kanté to play close to goal.\nFrank Lampard had picked a team to snipe and harry and chase, with Conor Gallagher and Kanté as his dogs of counter-pressing. And it worked for a bit. Chelsea did snap and chase and force some hurried clearances, producing 45 minutes of angry, chastened, slightly vague attacking pressure. Things happened but didn’t happen. Chelsea almost made chances. Reece James had an excellent game after the chasing in Madrid. Chelsea have many problems. James really isn’t one of them. Just before half-time Marc Cucurella allowed Thibaut Courtois to produce a world-class save, waiting just a little too long in front of goal.\nStill, though it felt a little bit desperate measures, an attempt to throw a shape over something shapeless. By the end Chelsea had launched 28 crosses into the Madrid box, which really is a lot of crosses. Is this the right way to do this thing? Maybe. Who knows. What does Todd think?\nMadrid just had to be good enough here. They took the lead through Rodrygo, set up by a lovely little pass from Vinícius Júnior. Rodrygo also walked the second goal into the net to make it 4-0 on aggregate. Kepa Arrizabalaga launched a wild, swinging leg as he lingered on the line. It felt a little insolent. But can you blame Madrid for that? This wasn’t so much men against boys as a highly competent team against a hallucinogenic fever dream of how to do soccer, winched into place by a coterie of hyped up management consultants.\nSomething a little grotesque has been created here, a real-time reminder of the things people want to do to this sport, of the distorting effects of money without sense or love or care. Even the half-time warmup was an excruciating spectacle as Chelsea’s star substitutes bumbled about in their padded coats bantering with Antonio Rüdiger, swaggering vaguely, conveying a sense of total alienation. There may have been more contemptuously disinterested knee lunges than those performed by Hakim Ziyech on the Stamford Bridge pitch. But not many. And none that spring to mind.\nSign up to Football Daily\nKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football\nafter newsletter promotion\nAnd so Chelsea’s season has pretty much reached an end point. Perhaps the promise of a Europa Conference League place might fire the synapses. More like this entity is heading for some more public contortions. The air is starting to hum a little. And pretty soon nobody around here will have much to lose.\nWhat happens to this club from here? There is no way of clawing back the stupid amounts of money spent. Income will now take a dive. What do you do to recoup those investment funds? Capsize the Premier League and start a money harvesting super league? Or cut your losses and move on to hydrogen batteries or olive oil or lithium mining?\nRight now this place is starting to resemble a footballing version of the Raft of the Medusa, a sinking vessel peopled by castaways, hanging on not out of love or duty but self preservation. Who is really looking out for this thing anyway, the delicate, patchwork entity that is Chelsea FC. The club’s third manager in the last eight months is basically a sole trader, expert, if nothing else in self-preservation. The players have their own brands and auras and future worth to protect.\nThe season may be dead on its feet, a lesson in nothing more than how to turn human talent into cold product. But there is still a sense of unresolved energy about this toxic escapade. The next few weeks might just make for interesting viewing.""}",Mykhaylo Mudryk,en
"{'content': 'Arsenal transfer news: The January transfer window was interesting (and important) for the Gunners as Mikel Arteta’s side is clearly a big contender for everything the Premier League has to offer… but the summer might have even more interesting subplots.[\xa0VIDEO:\xa0Premier League analysis ]\xa0After finishing two points behind north London rivals Tottenham, due to back-to-back defeats on Matchweeks 36 and 37 with UEFA Champions League qualification nearly in the bag, Arsenal isn’t leaving anything up to chance this go-round as they vie for the Premier League title.The Gunners lead the Premier League and show no signs of slowing down; They’ve been locking down their key performers to new deals as UEFA Champions League life is fast approaching the Arsenal.Following the departures of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Barcelona, in January 2022) and Alexandre Lacazette (end of contract, this summer), Arteta continues to rejuvenate an already stunning attack that includes Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka, and captain Martin Odegaard.[ TRANSFER NEWS: Liverpool | Chelsea | Tottenham | Man City\xa0| Man United ]Below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on Arsenal transfer news as Joe Prince-Wright (JPW), Nicholas Mendola (NM) and Andy Edwards (AE) will guide you through a hectic next few months.\nLatest transfer news\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Manchester United transfer news, live!

Latest reports, rumors, updates                            \n\n\n\nArsenal archived transfer news today, live!April 18 – Declan Rice prefers move to Arsenal, not Newcastle, this summerWith just one year remaining on his current contract, Declan Rice is all but certain to leave West Ham this summer, as Arsenal and Newcastle are both 1) preparing to be in next season’s UEFA Champions League, and 2) very interested in the 24-year-old services.However, all signs point toward Rice and Arsenal arranging a deal sometime in the coming weeks and/or months. According to a report from talkSPORT, Rice prefers to make the short move from east London to north London, where the Mikel Arteta requires a defensive-minded midfielder around which to build the next team in his Arsenal project.West Ham will hope to get somewhere in the neighborhood of $125 million for Rice, but that could be a difficult sales pitch to Arsenal, who could simply wait 12 more months and sign him for free. (AE)April 9 – Gunners could vie with Tottenham for Ligue 1 hotshotMontpellier striker Elye Wahi’s 12 goals and three assists this season have Arsenal and Tottenham (as well as PSG) looking to woo the striker to North London this summer, according to French site\xa0Jeunes Footeux.Wahi turned 20 in January and he has a contract through the 2024-25 season so he won’t come cheap. The report says Montpellier’s asking for around $35 million.The center forward’s more than 6-feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday’s league match with Toulouse.The advanced stats say Wahi’s a raw scorer; He carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. Mikel Arteta already has a young English-American center forward coming back from loan in France and a few options already in North London but… maybe? (NM)April 1 – Aurelien Tchouameni targeted by Arsenal (again)Real Madrid splashed a lot of cash on Monaco star Aurelien Tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn’t starting opens him up for a sale, according to Catalan site El Nacional.Long-linked with Arsenal and Liverpool before moving to Real, Tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, and Manchester United.The 23-year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball.Carlo Ancelotti has found minutes for Tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means Real boss Florentino Perez is looking at an $80 million player who is often on the bench to start games. Could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (NM)March 20 – Arsenal wants Galatasaray fullbackMikel Arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to Turkey for a French youngster.Sacha Boey, 22, has been capped by France at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with Galatasaray.Boey has two goals in 23 appearances this year, having moved from Rennes in 2021. He previously racked up 30-plus Ligue 1 appearances between Rennes and Dijon.A report from Turkish site Aksam has Arsenal leading the race of Lyon, Sporting Lisbon, and Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. (NM)February 27 – Gunners linked with Serie A star striker, midfielderMikel Arteta sees some things he likes in Italy, where World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez and Serbia star Sergej Milinkovic-Savic are reported as targets for the Arsenal.Martinez, 25, had been starring for Inter Milan long before he helped Lionel Messi win a World Cup, and the Argentine has 16 goals and seven assists across all competitions this season.TeamTalk says that Chelsea and Manchester United are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka.Calcio Mercato has the report on Milinkovic-Savic to Arsenal. Could the Lazio star finally make his move to the Premier League after being linked with an England transfer for ages?The 27-year-old has 39 caps and seven goals for Serbia, and he’s twice been Serie A Best XI, including last season. Milinkovic-Savic is Lazio’s two-time defending Player of the Year.Milinkovic-Savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. Newcastle and West Ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him European football. Advantage: Arsenal? (NM)February 25 – Arsenal eye Atalanta strikerCan never have enough finishers, can you?Arsenal is said to be joining Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Newcastle in pursuit of 20-year-old Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund.Twice-capped by Denmark, Hojlund started at home with Copenhagen before heading to Austria’s Sturm Graz.Hojlund has 13 goals and five assists in 29 appearances across all competitions between Sturm Graz and Atalanta, scoring against Dynamo Kiev in Champions League qualification for the latter.He’s one to watch, but it’s also worth noting that Atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for Champions League places in Serie A. He could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the UCL and UEL at a club that spotted him early. Heck, would a club like Arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to Italy? (NM)February 25 – Bukayo Saka, William Saliba approach new dealsReports out of North London say that Arsenal is nearing new deals with 21-year-olds: Center back William Saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker Bukayo Saka.Saka signed his current deal in 2019 and it runs through the end of the 2023-24 season: It’s safe to say his career has since found a new level.London-born and with 24 England caps, Saka is one of the faces of Arsenal’s renaissance. A relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in Premier League play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market.Easy decision for the Gunners, given his status within the team.

The price tag? About $15 million.Sure some Arsenal fans won’t love buying a player off of Chelsea, but Jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. The risk is low. (NM)January 29 – Brighton without Caicedo as talks continueA report from the Daily Mail says Arsenal have submitted a second bid for Moises Caicedo, with an improved offer of $86.6 million going in. Brighton are said to want $100 million for Caicedo. He did not play against Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday and reportedly he will not be around the team until Feb. 1, after the transfer deadline. Brighton have told Caicedo they want him to stay but his social media posting asking to be allowed to leave has put the writing on the wall. Will Arsenal up their offer and get their main ahead of Chelsea? (JPW)\nDe Zerbi: “Caicedo is a good guy. We will see.

Arsenal reportedly had a $65 million bid for Caicedo rejected as Brighton do not want to sell him in January. Fabrizio Romano has said that Arsenal will go in with an improved offer. Caicedo, 21, has been a revelation for the Seagulls and has been chased by Chelsea, and many other Premier League heavyweights, since the summer. This latest twist could force Brighton’s hand in the final hours of the January window but they are likely to want closer to $85 million for their talented box-to-box midfielder. (JPW)\nEXCL: Moises Caicedo didn’t turn up for training today — he wants leave immediately.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)January 26 – Huge offer for Caicedo on the way?It appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder. (JPW)January 25 – One back in (from La Liga), one out to FulhamReports say that Arsenal will led Cedric Soares head on loan to London neighbors Fulham, but not without a replacement.Sky Sports says that Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund are in hot pursuit of Real Valladolid right back Ivan Fresneda.Marca\xa0says that Fresneda missed Valladolid training amid reports that Arsenal matched BVB’s $15 million bid for the back.The 18-year-old has started regularly for Valladolid this season when healthy and has represented Spain at the U-18 and U-19 levels.Valladolid doesn’t have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to FBref.com. (NM)January 24 – Leeds join battle for McKennieAfter USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie was linked with a move to Arsenal, it appears that Leeds United are also keen on the American. According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week? That probably won’t be the case at Arsenal, at least initially. (JPW)\nLeeds are exploring new options for the midfield including Weston McKennie.

Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere.

And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)January 21 – Eduardo Camavinga loan talksThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)January 20 – Leandro Trossard confirmed as newest Arsenal signing\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023January 19 – Trossard talks intensifyIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved. (JPW)\nEXCLUSIVE: Arsenal have opened talks to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton, negotiations are advanced with official bid ready for permanent move. 🚨⚪️🔴 #AFC\nPersonal terms already agreed — talks will continue to get deal done soon. pic.twitter.com/WgiCtz1jG1\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2023January 16 – Moussa Diaby a top target?Arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby is the latest target. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)January 16 – Gunners in Declan Rice driver’s seat?The London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.The 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.Rice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)January 16 – Raphinha, Ferran Torres interestAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)January 15 – Gunners have interest in Leandro TrossardAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup.

Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.That said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. The structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and Arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp. Per the report, the issues with his contract talks at Barca involve the financial restraints they are facing and that has caused issues trying to agree new long-term contracts with current players. Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation. Both Arsenal and Newcastle are looking to add players in a structured and sensible way and Balde’s quality, and age, tick all of their boxes in terms of their recruitment model.

Romano adds that if Arsenal and Shakhtar cannot agree a fee, Chelsea are waiting in the wings to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window and given their recent recruitment success, it seems likely he will be another key part of Mikel Arteta’s jigsaw.

According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”Per our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)December 27 – Arsenal makes bid for Mykhailo MudrykReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.The Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.Some reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.Mudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe.

Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)\nIt appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder. (JPW)\nReports say that Arsenal will led Cedric Soares head on loan to London neighbors Fulham, but not without a replacement.\nSky Sports says that Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund are in hot pursuit of Real Valladolid right back Ivan Fresneda.\nMarca\xa0says that Fresneda missed Valladolid training amid reports that Arsenal matched BVB’s $15 million bid for the back.\nThe 18-year-old has started regularly for Valladolid this season when healthy and has represented Spain at the U-18 and U-19 levels.\nValladolid doesn’t have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to FBref.com. (NM)\nAfter USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie was linked with a move to Arsenal, it appears that Leeds United are also keen on the American. According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week? That probably won’t be the case at Arsenal, at least initially. (JPW)\nLeeds are exploring new options for the midfield including Weston McKennie. It’s one of the possibilities considered by the club as @MatteMoretto has reported ⚪️🇺🇸 #LUFC\nThe list still includes Azzedine Ounahi after opening bid made weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/GyTQZdDnYs\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 24, 2023\n\nArsenal’s gone to Serie A for its latest signing, 22-year-old Jakub Kiwior of Spezia and the Poland national team.\nA member of Poland’s World Cup team, Kiwior had been with Spezia since the start of the 2021-22 season.\nThe left-footed center back has nine caps for Poland and started all four of the club’s matches at the 2022 World Cup.\nKiwior turns 23 next month and will wear No. 15. A fee has not been disclosed.\n💬 ""It’s huge for me that Arsenal were interested and that I’m able to be here.""\nWe\'re so happy to have you here, Jakub 🙌\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 23, 2023\n\nAccording to a report from Gazzetta dello Sport, USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie is wanted by Arsenal. Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)\nOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)\nThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023\n\nIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved. (JPW)\nEXCLUSIVE: Arsenal have opened talks to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton, negotiations are advanced with official bid ready for permanent move. 🚨⚪️🔴 #AFC\nPersonal terms already agreed — talks will continue to get deal done soon. pic.twitter.com/WgiCtz1jG1\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2023\n\nArsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby is the latest target. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)\nThe London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.\nThe 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.\nRice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)\nAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)\nAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup. (JPW)\nMykhailo Mudryk has signed for Chelsea, as the Blues reportedly offered him double what Arsenal were prepared to pay him in wages. Mudryk, 22, has signed an eight-and-a-half year deal and the Ukrainian winger will be a big part of their future as they continue to expensively revamp their squad. As for Arsenal, this is one that got away as the finances of the deal just didn’t add up for the Gunners. They are now moving on to other options… (JPW)\n🚨 Chelsea complete the signing of Mudryk on an eight-and-a-half year deal.

There have been reports over the last week or so that Chelsea could make a move for Mudryk but this latest update from Fabrizio Romano seems to be a lot more concrete and Chelsea are trying to get one over their London rivals. Arsenal have been haggling over the transfer fee for many days with Shakhtar and it seems like Chelsea are ready to pay the Ukrainian side whatever they want for the talented winger. This would be a huge blow for Arsenal but I guess every player has his price, right?

(AE)\nThe latest reports on Mykhaylo Mudryk to Arsenal have arrived and although the Gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the Ukraine international winger has flown to Turkey and gone on tour with them. Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.\nThat said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. The structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and Arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup. (JPW)\nShakhtar Donetsk finally show signs of cracking over Mykhaylo Mudryk as Arsenal make positive steps towards agreement during talks on Monday.

The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp. Per the report, the issues with his contract talks at Barca involve the financial restraints they are facing and that has caused issues trying to agree new long-term contracts with current players. Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation. Both Arsenal and Newcastle are looking to add players in a structured and sensible way and Balde’s quality, and age, tick all of their boxes in terms of their recruitment model. (JPW)\nAnother day, another update on Mykhaylo Mudryk but this does not involved Arsenal. Per a report from Jack Rosser of The Sun, Chelsea are ready to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international as Arsenal have yet to agree a transfer fee with Shakhtar Donetsk. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window but Chelsea certainly need some fresh attacking talent too and Shakhtar’s sporting director Darijo Srna is set to hold talks with the Blues this week. This all feels very Willian and Luis Diaz esque.

Per a report from Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal have submitted a bid of over $52.8 million up front to Shakhtar Donetsk. Plenty of add ons are included in the deal too. Romano adds that if Arsenal and Shakhtar cannot agree a fee, Chelsea are waiting in the wings to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window and given their recent recruitment success, it seems likely he will be another key part of Mikel Arteta’s jigsaw.

According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”\nPer our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)\nReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.\nThe Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.\nSome reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.\nMudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe.

Gabriel Jesus, 25, has joined the Gunners for $54.7 million from Manchester City, and Mikel Arteta will be absolutely delighted with this deal. With Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez arriving this summer, Jesus needed to move to get more minutes as he aims to start for Brazil at the World Cup in November. He has found the perfect spot at Arsenal, as they needed a number nine, his playing style and philosophy matches theirs perfectly, and he knows Arteta very well from the latter being Man City’s assistant coach. This transfer works so well for everyone it actually hurts. Now, if Jesus can just become a little more clinical, this will be one of the deals of the summer, but at least we now know that Jesus wants to play up front instead of on the right.

It will be intriguing to see how Turner fares early on at Arsenal, especially as they are heading to the U.S. on a preseason tour and he should play plenty of minutes for the Gunners as he gets to know his new teammates, coaches and settles in further.

He said then that offers as low as 1% of the equivalent TV rights price paid for the men’s World Cup were “not acceptable.”In March, for world soccer’s annual meeting in Rwanda, Infantino reported no progress with TV broadcasters while also announcing a more than three-fold increase in team prize money to $110 million for the tournament.Infantino has been clearly rankled that player-led criticism of FIFA for not offering equal prize money – the 32 men’s teams shared $440 million prize money at the 2022 World Cup – is amplified by media he believes is undervaluing women’s soccer.The Women’s World Cup has standalone broadcast and sponsor deals rather than being bundled with the men’s tournament – a policy started since Infantino was elected in 2016, when he pledged “continued and intensified effort” to develop the women’s game.The FIFA leader suggested on Monday “public broadcasters in particular have a duty to promote and invest in women’s sport.”“Women deserve it!

Here’s how it works.\n\nNewcastle United are being linked with mega-money moves with massive targets for Arsenal and Tottenham\nNewcastle United are ready to disrupt the established so-called Big Six with transfer moves to put a spanner in the works of rivals.\nThe Magpies are sitting fourth in the Premier League, three points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur with a game in hand. It looks like a first Champions League campaign for 20 years is imminent – and with that, big signings could be made.\nThe likes of Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes have already joined for big fees but with the influx of Champions League money, Newcastle United could have more breathing room from financial fair play laws, enabling them to spend even bigger in the upcoming transfer window.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph (opens in new tab), Newcastle are targeting four ""elite signings"" this summer, with Declan Rice, Ivan Toney and James Maddison have all been mentioned as potential new recruits.\nRice is thought to be Arsenal\'s No.1 target this summer, with the Gunners looking for another midfielder. The Gunners are said to be confident of a deal according to TalkSport (opens in new tab) but given that they have refused to ""overpay"" for targets above what they value them to be worth, Newcastle could well swoop in sign the West Ham United star first – similarly to how Mikel Arteta missed out on Mykhaylo Mudryk.\nSimilarly, transfer guru\xa0Fabrizio Romano (opens in new tab)\xa0recently confirmed Tottenham are tracking James Maddison – and should the Magpies pip the Lilywhites to the post of Champions League football, it\'s likely that they will position themselves as the first-choice destination for the Leicester City playmaker.\n“Tottenham are monitoring James Maddison for sure, also\xa0Newcastle\xa0have his name on their list since last August as he’s always been appreciated,”\xa0Romano told\xa0Caught Offside (opens in new tab).\n\nIvan Toney, however, may be the most fascinating link of the lot. The Brentford striker was released by Newcastle as a youngster and with the likes of Alexander Isak and Callum Wilson as first-choice No.9s, there isn\'t an obvious need for a new striker.\nNewcastle have also been linked with Arsenal star Kieran Tierney by the Telegraph (opens in new tab).\nFormer Newcastle star Yohan Cabaye has told FFT he was ""surprised"" when Joe Kinnear called him ""Yohan Kebab"" live on radio – and why he went on strike at the Magpies.\nKieran Tierney is a major target for the Toon, while former Leeds star Raphinha is on the shortlist, too.\nIn other news, emails have revealed the UK Government\'s involvement in Newcastle United\'s Saudi takeover.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nMark White has been a staff writer on FourFourTwo since joining in January 2020, writing pieces for both online and the magazine.

Aaron Ramsdale has said anything can happen and Arsenal aren’t giving up on their title hopes but it looks pretty unlikely Manchester City will slip up now. Arteta has stuck with the same players in recent weeks but it seems like Leandro Trossard and Jorginho will start this game. Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli froze against Man City but they should be back to their marauding best.\nChelsea have so many quality players but how does Lampard put them together? Against Brentford they played four central midfielders in the team and Chelsea are almost in damage limitation mode right now. That is a sad state of affairs for a squad this talented. They are totally lacking in confidence, a plan and momentum. If it is Mauricio Pochettino who comes in this summer, he has a heck of a job on his hands.\nOUT: William Saliba (back), Takehiro Tomiyasu (knee), Mohamed Elneny (knock)\nOUT: Armando Broja (knee), Kalidou Koulibaly (thigh), Reece James (hamstring), Mason Mount (pelvic), Marc Cucurella (thigh)\nLatest USMNT news\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                USMNT, Mexico make most of limited chances in friendly draw                            \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                USMNT striker Daryl Dike to undergo Achilles surgery                            \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                2026 World Cup venues selected: Which cities will host in USA, Canada, Mexico?\nFollow @JPW_NBCSports\nLeeds United will reportedly fire Javi Gracia and hire Sam Allardyce as manager for the final four games of the Premier League season in a desperation move to jumpstart its players.If so, Gracia’s last match was a 4-1 beatdown at Bournemouth, a loss that left 17th-place Leeds with the second-worst relegation odds in the Premier League.Leeds has already announced that director of football Victor Orta has left the club.Oddly enough, Allardyce’s last Premier League match was a May 23, 2021 defeat to Leeds at Elland Road.[ MORE: Premier League relegation scrap ]Gracia was hired in February after the club fired American boss Jesse Marsch with the club in 17th place and in one of the most congested relegation fights in history.Michael Skubala led Leeds to a draw and loss before Gracia took the reins, and Leeds won three and drew one in a six-match stretch that saw the club rise as high as 13th.But the club has conceded four or more goals three times in an ensuing five-match winless run and Gracia, seemingly, has run out of time.

"{'content': 'Liverpool came back from a 2-0 deficit to hamper Arsenal’s Premier League title hopes and revive the race for the Premier League Trophy following a 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday.Arsenal went ahead through a Gabriel Martinelli goal and assist, the latter to Gabriel Jesus, but Liverpool pulled one back through Mohamed Salah.The hosts then overcame a missed Salah penalty and controlled the second half long enough for Roberto Firmino to hang mid-air and thud a Trent Alexander-Arnold cross past Ramsdale.WATCH LIVERPOOL v ARSENAL FULL MATCH REPLAY – STREAM LINKArsenal should feel fortunate to come away with a point as Salah got himself into promising positions time and again but missed the frame with every one but his first-half goal and a late curler saved by Aaron Ramsdale.The Gunners now hold a six-point lead on second-place Manchester City, who has a match-in-hand and a home match versus Arsenal left on its docket.Liverpool’s point leaves it eighth with 44 points, two points off seventh-place Brighton and 12 off the top-four. \nPremier League news\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Newcastle vs Arsenal: How to watch live, stream link, team news                            \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Tottenham vs Crystal Palace: How to watch live, stream link, team news                            \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Arsenal vs Chelsea: How to watch live, stream link, team news                            \n\n\n\n\nLiverpool comes back for point but spares Arsenal embarrassmentMohamed Salah hit an early chance wide of the near post, then missed the net three times in the second half including a penalty.Jordan Henderson airmailed a rebound through traffic in the first half, and Cody Gakpo rolled a breakaway into Aaron Ramsdale in the second half.Ramsdale also had one sensational stop on Ibrahima Konate’s chested effort, keeping it 2-2.\nKonate was SO CLOSE to the late winner for Liverpool. \n📺: @peacock | #LIVARS pic.twitter.com/Crmi9u3VYi\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) April 9, 2023This could’ve been so much worse for an Arsenal team that held a 2-0 lead and looked set for a coronation as recently as a few hours ago, then rode its luck all the way over the line.Liverpool held 59 percent of the ball, out-attempted Arsenal 21-9, and won the xG fight by a 3.96-1.41 margin.To be clear, Arsenal opened the door to the throne room. And it could be open much wider if Liverpool had its finishing boots.The Gunners’ second half performance will give a lot of hope to opposing attacks, as the first test without William Saliba against a good attack was a failed one.Liverpool vs Arsenal player ratings: Stars of the ShowThiago Alcantara:\xa0His substitution absolutely changed the game, and showed the Premier League what Liverpool can look like with a midfielder capable of controlling the pitch.Gabriel Martinelli:\xa0Brazilian was up-and-down the pitch all game, getting the goal and assist that helped Arsenal to what could be a huge point.Ibrahima Konate:\xa0Some absolutely pivotal interventions amongst his seven recoveries and 9-of-11 record in duels.Aaron Ramsdale: Massive late saves on Mohamed Salah and Konate kept this from being 3-2 or 4-2.fotmob.comLiverpool vs Arsenal analysis, as it happened: 2-2FIRST HALF: Well, well, well, what an affair this has been at Anfield.The host Reds came out of the gates with vigor and the match very much looked like it could be tight and touchy (which it became over the time).But Arsenal cut through Liverpool so easily for two goals that were arguably against the run of play or at least in defiance of appearance.Gabriel Martinelli’s goal and set-up of Gabriel Jesus gave another look to the game, one of inevitability, but Mohamed Salah beat Gabriel Magalhaes to a ball in the six after Liverpool diced up Arsenal in a bit of turnabout being fair play.And that’s how we’re sitting 2-1 at the break. Shots are 8-5 to Liverpool and xG is 1.20-1.14 to Arsenal, with the hosts holding 53 percent possession.SECOND HALF:\xa0OH NO! Rob Holding’s taken down Diogo Jota in the boss.Double OH NO! Mohamed Salah has missed the goal with his penalty, low and to the right of the right post.Still 2-1 Arsenal, and barely.Liverpool continue with the ball and keep pushing for an equalizer. Aaron Ramsdale denies Salah at the back post, and Liverpool’s players are furious when a rally is stopped before the hour mark due to Gabriel blocking a shot with his face and slumping to the turf.60′ Enter Thiago Alcantara for his first match since early February, and he’ll be joined by Darwin Nunez as Curtis Jones and Jota, respectively.Thiago has been the story of the match since his introduction, both pushing play forward but also making interventions when Arsenal gets the ball. Still, it’s 2-1 Arsenal heading into the final 15 minutes.78′\xa0Fabinho out, Roberto Firmino in as Liverpool is, obviously, going for it with their flickering top-four hopes all but out.Now Salah has sent Nunez through to goal, but Ramsdale is wise to the opportunity and gets low to stop it.Jurgen Klopp reaction: Liverpool really should’ve won“We had to run a lot and work a lot but that is normal,” Klopp said, via the BBC. “In a game against Arsenal you have to close the centre. We had our struggles but when we were more compact and played with more direction it was good.“In the end it is a question of how can we not win this game? It is obviously much better than getting nothing. I am not overly happy but I am absolutely okay with it.”What’s next?Liverpool’s off until an April 17 (Monday) match at Leeds, while Arsenal will visit West Ham one day earlier.Gabriel Martinelli goal video: Arsenal counters to go in frontGabriel Jesus goal video: Slick header of Martinelli crossMohamed Salah goal video: Reds cut into 18, 6Roberto Firmino goal video: Brazilian hangs in air to nod equalizer homeAndy Robertson video: Incident with linesman’s elbow raises eyebrowsPGMOL is said to be reviewing an incident in which linesman Constantine Hatziadakis makes contact with an elbow to Liverpool defender Andy Robertson’s face.\n“That’s about a guy that will never linesman in the Premier League again.”\nRebecca Lowe, Tim Howard and @The2RobbiesNBC react to Andrew Robertson appearing to be elbowed in the face by a linesman. #MyPLMorning pic.twitter.com/FIVfcUkSMm\n— NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) April 9, 2023How to watch Liverpool vs Arsenal live, stream link and start timeKick off: 11:30am ET Sunday\nTV Channel: Peacock\nOnline: Stream via Peacock PremiumKey storylines & in-form players to watchLiverpool’s three-match winless streak features exactly one goal, and that’s come from Mohamed Salah.

When this Newcastle side gets going and St James’ Park is fully behind them, there are few teams who can stop them.\nArsenal’s top four hopes unravelled at Newcastle at around this time last season and Arteta will be hoping his young side learned from that harsh lesson. They have still taken a huge, and unexpected, step forward this season as they’ve already qualified for the Champions League. But there is now a negative vibe around the Gunners as defensive mistakes have crept in all over the place over the last few weeks as their title bid has stalled.

The corresponding wage bump could be enough to convince the Argentine to focus on a domestic run in England. (NM)March 20 – More GK smoke as Blues linked with OnanaIt sure sounds like someone different will join the Chelsea goalkeeper competition next season.After the below reports that Chelsea was eyeballing Leeds’ youngster Illan Meslier, there’s more talk that the Blues wants fresh blood between the posts.Andre Onana, 26, has been a shining star at Inter Milan and would be of interest to a great deal of teams should he hit the transfer market. Fichajes says Chelsea loves the idea of Onana in London.And will Chelsea’s possible (probable?) failure to make the UEFA Champions League stop prospects from seeing Stamford Bridge as a 2023-24 possibility? (NM)March 19 – Goalkeeper moves to see Mendy out, Meslier in?Kepa Arrizabalaga has taken the proverbial No. 1 shirt from Edouard Mendy, and could that mean an exit for the Senegalese goalkeeper as multiple reports say Chelsea’s informed Mendy he can find a new home this summer.The 31-year-old Mendy, of course, won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021 but they’re apparently happy to let him move on in the summer despite a contract settled through the 2024-25 season.That much time left on a deal — and status as Senegal’s No. 1 goalkeeper — should net Chelsea some money and the Blues may be ready to spend it right back on Leeds United keeper Illan Meslier.Meslier is just 23 years old and made a huge impression on the Premier League last season with Leeds, though this season has seen ups-and-down for the club, Kepa leads the league in save percentage but Meslier is well off that pace. And only Leicester’s Danny Ward and Southampton’s (also young) Gavin Bazunu rate worse in goals prevented according to FotMob.Football Insider says $35 million is Leeds’ asking price for Meslier. (NM)March 15 –\xa0Alexis Mac Allister linked with Brighton exitWorld Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister is “ready” to leave Brighton and Hove Albion this summer, and a host of Premier League big boys want to secure his services.Mac Allister, 24, has been absolutely massive at Brighton and his work as a feature player in Argentina’s World Cup win only served to elevate his standing.Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Spurs are linked with the most interest and each carries a reasonable link to Mac Allister but would any make more sense than a reunion with 22-year-old international teammate Enzo Fernandez?At some point Chelsea is going to have to rein in the spending but the midfield still holds plenty of potential transfer energy with Mateo Kovacic linked with Man City, N’Golo Kante injured and not getting any younger, and Mason Mount still yet to agree a new deal.Mac Allister is a hungry, complete, and forward-thinking midfielder who doesn’t shy away from a tackle. He’s a huge part of why the Seagulls have been able to navigate so many sales and does seem likely, along with Moises Caicedo, to be the next to leave the Amex Stadium… especially if the Brighton can’t get European football.

The 22-year-old midfielder was a star for 2022 World Cup winners Argentina, but has only been playing his club ball in Europe for six months after joining from River Plate last summer. (AE)January 28 – Malo Gusto arrivesChelsea have signed French right back Malo Gusto from Lyon and have loaned him back to the Ligue 1 side for the rest of this season. Chelsea have agreed to pay $32.6 million (plus add ons) for Gusto as the 19-year-old right defender is touted as one of the best young full backs in Europe. Malo Gusto will add extra competition for Reece James down Chelsea’s right side and is a very similar player as he loves to get forward.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)January 24 – AC Milan in talks about Christian Pulisic?Is this the end for the USMNT star at Chelsea? According to a report in Marca, the agents of Christian Pulisic have said that AC Milan have opened talks with Chelsea about signing the winger. Pulisic, 24, is out injured for at least another month and after Chelsea signed Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix and Noni Madueke so far in January, they have loaded up on new attacking midfielders and wingers. Pulisic’s time at Stamford Bridge appears to be up as he has just 18 months left on his current contract. This move to Milan seems like it would be a very good one for Pulisic. They are the reigning Italian champs, have the likes of Olivier Giroud, Sergino Dest and Fikayo Tomori in their squad who know Pulisic well, and he will get regular minutes in a team which competes in the UEFA Champions League. On top of that, Serie A will suit his playing style better than the Premier League.

At some point Chelsea won’t be able to spend more money but Everton needs it and seemingly Gordon’s figure has dropped a little given his drop down the Toffees’ pecking order.It all seems wild, but this is Chelsea in 2022-23.

Are failing to sign the Young Player of the 2022 World Cup earlier in January, the report says Chelsea are due to restart talks this week with Benfica about signing the Argentine star. The central midfielder is exactly what Graham Potter needs and his aggression, skill and drive from central areas was a huge reason for Argentina’s success at the World Cup. Fernandez was very keen on joining Chelsea but after talks stalled with Benfica he has refocused and has been playing well for the Portuguese giants. Still, Fernandez has made it clear he wants the move and Chelsea may try to pay less than his $131 million release clause.Another report from Football.London says that Chelsea still want to sign Brighton’s 21-year-old midfielder Moises Caicedo. They say Chelsea have had a $68 million bid rejected by Brighton but the Blues are willing to go back in and will up their offer for their Ecuador star. Roberto De Zerbi has admitted it will be tough for Brighton to keep Caicedo but he would prefer if he left in the summer rather than January. Let’s see what offer Chelsea make next.

As they close in on a loan move for Joao Felix (see below), they are also reportedly interested in signing French international striker Marcus Thuram from Borussia Monchengladbach. According to The Times, Chelsea want to sign Thuram, 25, and his contract runs out in the summer. The forward was part of France’s 2022 World Cup squad and has the ability to lead the line but can also make runs in-behind to create space for others. With Christopher Nkunku expected to arrive this summer, plus Felix coming in and others linked, it looks like Chelsea want to overhaul their entire attacking unit. Thuram has scored 13 goals in 17 appearances in all competitions for ‘Gladbach this season and Chelsea desperately need someone to come in and add a clinical edge to their play.According to the same report, Chelsea are also interested in signing Noni Madueke, 20, from PSV Eindhoven. The England U21 winger has been linked with so many Premier League clubs in the past. His talent is undoubted but do Chelsea really need more wide attacking players right now? They have Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount, Hakim Ziyech, Raheem Sterling and are about to add Joao Felix to that mix. It seems like they could probably strengthen in other areas and it also seems like their recruitment plan hasn’t really been properly figured out with so many new figures joining their technical staff in recent months.\xa0(JPW)January 9 – Joao Felix heading to the BridgeThis one came out of nowhere, right? Joao Felix is heading to Chelsea on loan from Atletico Madrid according to David Ornstein from The Athletic. Felix has stalled at Atleti and per the report, the Portugal international likes the project at Chelsea and has chosen to join them ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal. Given Chelsea’s current struggles under Graham Potter, particularly in the final third and creating and finishing off chances, Felix will be a great addition. In the right system he can be an excellent addition and he is able to play up top or across the attacking midfield roles.

The report states that Kante, 31, may well sign a new contract at Chelsea as it was feared he would leave as a free agent when his current deal expires in the summer of 2023. Keeping Kante around, and fit, will be key, but the report also suggests that Chelsea know signing a central midfielder is going to cost them a lot. But they’re keen to crack on and do it anyway. Rice is a former Chelsea academy star and has long been linked with a move back to Stamford Bridge, while Bellingham is obviously a superstar in the making and Premier League and European giants are lining up to sign him this summer.

It is reported (below) that Chelsea will pay the Norwegian side $12.7 million for Fofana. He has scored 22 goals in 39 appearances for Molde in 2022 and has already made his debut for the Ivory Coast.With Armando Broja recently going down with an injury and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang having a mixed start to life at Stamford Bridge, perhaps Fofana will see plenty of minutes this season? his signings hints at a sign of things to come at Chelsea, as they’re focused on signing the best young talent from around the world and then making them into the stars of the future.

A report from The Athletic states that Chelsea have offered to pay Leipzig more than Nkunku $60 million release clause (which kicks in next summer) and want to wrap up a deal which would see the 24-year-old French international arrive at Stamford Bridge next summer. The report says that Nkunku has already agreed to the deal, while our partners in the UK at Sky Sports believe the prolific striker (who has already scored six goals in eight Bundesliga games this season) has yet to make up his mind.Nkunku scored 20 goals last season and added 13 assists as he was named the Bundesliga Player of the Season. His quality is undoubted and he would be a perfect forward addition to Chelsea’s fluid attacking system under Potter. Nkunku learning from Aubameyang, one of the most prolific strikers in the game, is surely a recipe for success. After moving on Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku this summer, it is clear that Chelsea are keen to freshen up their attack and that could also mean the likes of Christian Pulisic, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech may be surplus to requirements.At the other end of the pitch a report from the Daily Telegraph suggests that Chelsea are also looking to wrap up a deal to sign Leipzig’s Croatian center back Gvardiol. Per the report, Gvardiol has a release clause close to $45 million and Chelsea are willing to meet it. The 20-year-old is considered to be one of the top center back prospects in Europe and was chased by Chelsea, among many others, this summer. With Wesley Fofana and Kalidou Koulibaly signed up in the summer, Chelsea already have extensive, and quality, options at center back. However, Koulibaly hasn’t played in either of Graham Potter’s two games in charge so far as Thiago Silva, 38, has been preferred. Gvardiol and Fofana are seen as Chelsea’s long-term center back duo.

The arrival of Fofana takes Chelsea’s spending to over $290 million this summer, as he joins Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly and Marc Cucurella in signing for the Blues. Fofana will add class to Chelsea’s defense and is likely to line up alongside Thiago Silva and Koulibaly. His ability to bring the ball out of the back and start attacks will be crucial to getting Chelsea on the front foot in Tuchel’s preferred 3-4-2-1 system.

Gallagher and Broja have worked so hard on loan spells over the years but it just doesn’t seem like they’re gong to become regulars at Chelsea under Thomas Tuchel. They could definitely be stars at Everton and if the Toffees get the duo (permanently or on loan) plus get a good chunk of cash for Gordon, that is a very good deal for them.

Hudson-Odoi, 21, has struggled to get in to Thomas Tuchel’s plans this season and his career has stalled due to injuries and a loss of form over the last 12 months. The tricky winger will hope playing regularly for Leverkusen, who are in the UEFA Champions League, will get him back to his best and help him make a late push for the England squad ahead of the World Cup this summer. After being linked with Newcastle, Leicester and Southampton, this is a good move for CHO and he will become a key man for Bayer in the Bundesliga. (JPW)August 29 – Chelsea, Arsenal set to battle for Zaha late in the windowA report from the Guardian says that Chelsea have renewed their interest in Wilfried Zaha as the Crystal Palace winger has less than a year left on his current contract. Zaha, 29, has been linked with Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal on multiple occasions over the years and a report from The Independent says his agent is pushing for a move to Chelsea. The Guardian says that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still Chelsea’s top target but Zaha is another option.Zaha is probably the best player in the Premier League outside the top six. His brief spell at Manchester United as a youngster didn’t work out but he’s been consistently excellent for Palace and the South London club would be devastated to lose him. However, he has less than a year left on his contract so if they’re going to get anything for him, now is the time. Previously Palace wanted $90 million for Zaha, which is understandable given that he’s the focal point of their attack and one of the main reasons they’ve stayed in the Premier League consistently over the last eight seasons.Chelsea are on the lookout for players who can provide more of a cutting edge in attack and Zaha definitely does that, while his pace, directness and trickery on the counter could give Thomas Tuchel exactly what he needs. Per the report from The Independent, Arsenal are also said to be interested in Zaha (they are chasing Pedro Neto from Wolves but he could prove too difficult to sign) as Mikel Arteta wants to sign one more attacking players before the window shuts. (JPW)August 26 – Breakthrough in Fofana deal?It seems like Chelsea and Leicester City have finally agreed a fee for Wesley Fofana, as The Athletic believe an agreement is in place.

He has been left out of training at Leicester in recent days after having his head turned and on the eve of Chelsea hosting Leicester (Fofana will not be playing) the two clubs have agreed a fee.

The 33-year-old is closing in on a reunion with Thomas Tuchel and a return to London and the Premier League.Given Barcelona’s financial situation, and their plethora of new attacking talents, letting Aubameyang go makes sense. Chelsea need a clinical finisher to put away the chances Tuchel’s side create game after game and having Auba, Raheem Sterling and Mason Mount in attack is a very good trio. This will give Chelsea’s attack a ruthless edge, which they badly need, and will be a huge boost in their push for a top four finish. (JPW)\nAubameyang to Chelsea is now very close and is a straight-cash deal. https://t.co/QCY6eWLjN0\n— Ben Jacobs (@JacobsBen) August 25, 2022August 19 – Wesley Fofana asks to be left out of Leicester squad amid Chelsea interestLeicester manager Brendan Rodgers is expected to leave Wesley Fofana out of his matchday squad when the Foxes face Southampton on Saturday, as the 21-year-old center back tries to force through a transfer to Chelsea. The Blues have had two previous bids for the Frenchman rejected, but new owner Todd Boehly has thus far been undeterred. This isn’t quite the point of no return for Fofana, but the developing saga is trending that direction. (AE)August 18 – Chelsea set to make first Aubameyang bidChelsea are set to step up their pursuit of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, as a meeting is scheduled to discuss doing a deal for Aubameyang. Per the report from Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea will soon make their opening bid to Barcelona for Aubameyang as the 33-year-old is a top target in the final weeks of the transfer window.Aubameyang is loved by Thomas Tuchel and was lethal when he played up front for him at Borussia Dortmund. In fairness, Aubameyang has been lethal pretty much wherever he’s played. Barcelona boss Xavi is said to want to keep Aubameyang but given Barca’s financial situation, if a good offer comes in from Chelsea they may sell the Gabonese striker. For Chelsea, this is exactly what they need, as their draw at home against Tottenham proved their need for a clinical forward. (JPW)\nPierre Aubameyang deal. Meeting in the next hours, scheduled since last Sunday – main focus will be on the personal terms.

Chelsea really want to sign Gordon, 21, and Everton really don’t want to sell him. The England U21 international is the next big star to come out of Everton’s academy and his importance to the Toffees, especially after losing Richarlison earlier this summer, is clear. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Chelsea have upped their bid to over $54 million but that still isn’t enough as Everton rejected it and don’t want to sell their prized asset. This will likely end in Chelsea offering over $65 million for Gordon, who has a couple of decent seasons in the PL and shown plenty of promise, and Everton accepting that. As much potential as Gordon has, that price would be enough for Frank Lampard to buy two proven internationals to replace him and strengthen elsewhere, probably up front. (JPW)August 15 – Everton reject $48.2-million bid from Chelsea for Anthony GordonAccording to multiple reports out of the UK, Chelsea offered Everton $48.2 million for 21-year-old midfielder Anthony Gordon, the breakout star and a rare bright spot in the Toffees’ 2021-22 season, but the Blues were swiftly rejected with a further bid expected in the not-so-distant future.It would appear that, under the direction of new owner Todd Boehly, Chelsea have made it a priority to target young English talent in the transfer market. Less than two weeks ago, the Blues paid as much as $24.1 million to sign 18-year-old Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa. Now, the reported bid for Gordon. It’ll get rather expensive paying the domestic-talent premium for too many more young Lions, but it’s clear that Boehly and Co., are taking a long-range view of Chelsea’s future rather than focusing solely on the here and now. We’ll see how Thomas Tuchel feels about that, if he doesn’t get all the signings he feels he needs before transfer deadline day. (AE)August 11 – Frenkie de Jong, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pursuit continuesChelsea continued to be linked with moves for Barcelona duo Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Our partners in the UK at Sky Sports say that De Jong, 25, is open to a move to Chelsea as they play in the Champions League. Per the report, Chelsea will match the $87 million bid Manchester United for Frenkie de Jong earlier this summer. However, the issue remains that De Jong is owed over $20 million in deferred wages and Barcelona also want him to take a pay cut if he is to stay at the Nou Camp. Hence a few reasons why he could be on the move. But seriously, who knows what is going to happen at Barcelona from one day to the next right now!?When it comes to Aubameyang, there is definitely interest from both parties as the Gabonese striker, 33, has fallen down the pecking order at Barcelona after the summer arrivals of Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha. Aubameyang has three years left on his Barcelona contract but is said to be open to a return to the Premier League and London. He thrived under current Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel when the duo worked together at Borussia Dortmund and you can see him slotting in very nicely as the lone forward in Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 formation. As for De Jong, well, Chelsea’s priority is to sign a center back but with Jorginho and N’Golo Kante coming towards the twilight of their careers, De Jong is a very similar player and would slot in very nicely to safeguard the future of Chelsea’s midfield. (JPW)August 8 – Leicester, Southampton, Borussia Dortmund lining up for want-away winger Callum Hudson-OdoiCallum Hudson-Odoi believes the writing is on the wall regarding his Chelsea career: If he has not yet convinced Thomas Tuchel he should be a more important figure in the team, he is not likely to ever do so, therefore a move away is required. Fortunately for the 21-year-old, he won’t be without plenty of options. According to a report from the Guardian, Southampton are interested in a loan move, while Leicester and Borussia Dortmund are keen to sign Hudson-Odoi permanently. Dortmund previously sought a loan for Hudson-Odoi last summer. Chelsea previously rejected bids of more than $25 million from Bayern Munich prior to Tuchel’s arrival at the club. (AE)August 6 – Chelsea expected to make world-record bid for Wesley FofanaNow, this is getting out of hand, isn’t it? Wesley Fofana, 21, is a very good center back and is a star of the future. But according to the Guardian, Chelsea are willing to pay a world-record $102 million to sign Fofana. That would be a world-record fee for a defender. It would surpass what Manchester United paid for Harry Maguire and what Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk. There is, of course, a Premier League premium on this deal and Leicester City also say they don’t need to sell Fofana. They probably don’t but if Fofana is open to the move, which reports suggest he is, then the Foxes should probably snap up this fee as they h ave Jonny Evans, Jannik Vestergaard and Caglar Soyuncu around at center back and can use the money to significantly improve their squad (which they need to do after not signing a single player this summer).When it comes to Chelsea, are they overpaying for players this summer? Marc Cucurella, Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly have all arrived for huge transfer fees and it seems like Chelsea’s new owners are paying somewhat of a premium because they are, well, Chelsea’s new owners. Todd Boehly is getting a lot of stick for paying over the odds and only time will tell if Cucurella, Fofana and Co. are worth these huge transfer fees. The focus at Chelsea will likely now be on selling players and they will have to move on a lot of fringe players to offset this huge spending spree. (JPW)\nChelsea are willing to go to £85m for Fofana and believe that would be enough to get him. Would take their spending over £200m and could be more beyond that (FDJ, Casadei, Auba targeted). So are they going to be able to make anything back on sales? #cfc\n— Jacob Steinberg (@JacobSteinberg) August 6, 2022August 5 – Chelsea make new bid of $84.5 million for Leicester defender Wesley FofanaChelsea remain undeterred in their pursuit of Leicester center back Wesley Fofana, who is now the subject of an $84.5-million bid by the Blues, according to a report. Brendan Rodgers has insisted the 21-year-old is not for sale, but new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly is expected to return with an even bigger bid if the latest offer is rejected. Interesting negotiating strategy, that, but it’ll likely result in Chelsea getting what they want in the end. (AE)\nChelsea\'s latest bid for Wesley Fofana is over £70m and won\'t be the last one made if rejected. Brendan Rodgers again said Fofana isn\'t for sale, but Todd Boehly means business. Fofana is Chelsea\'s number one target between now and when window shuts.\n— Ben Jacobs (@JacobsBen) August 5, 2022August 5 – Marc Cucurella signs for Chelsea in reported $75 million dealOne of the biggest shock signings of the summer has been completed, with Spanish left back Marc Cucurella signing for Chelsea from Brighton for a reported $75 million fee ($66 million up front, with $9 million in add ons). Cucurella, 24, looked set to join Manchester City for most of the summer but the reigning PL champs baulked at the price Brighton wanted for him. So in stepped Chelsea. They have also sent promising young defender Levi Colwill to Brighton on loan as part of the deal.As for Cucurella, his rise has been meteoric. He had a phenomenal season at Brighton in 2021-22 after arriving from Getafe last summer and he is a superb attacking left back who will perfectly slot into Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 as a left wing-back. Marcos Alonso is expected to move to Barcelona after this deal was confirmed and Cucurella and Ben Chilwell will battle it out for the starting spot at Chelsea. There’s a lot of talk about Chelsea overpaying for Cucurella, especially when they already have Chilwell, and there’s logic in that. He is a quality player, though, and Chelsea now need to sign a couple of center backs and probably another striker and this will have been a very good window for them. (JPW)\nA message from Marc! 👋 #CucurellaIsChelsea pic.twitter.com/Gm2l7WF5Q7\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) August 5, 2022August 4 – Cesar Azpilicueta sticking around, Cucurella removed from Brighton trainingLongtime Chelsea leader and captain Cesar “Dave” Azpilicueta is not going back to Spain after all.The Osasuna academy graduate who then went to Marseille before moving to the Premier League was expected to sign for Barcelona but things have been drawn out when it comes to Barca opening up room for wages.It’ll be a two-year contract for Azpilicueta according to several reports but Chelsea has not yet announced the move. It does feel right that the 32-year-old defender remain at Stamford Bridge deeper into his career, if not to the finish line.Meanwhile, Football.London says that Brighton manager Graham Potter has removed Marc Cucurella from first-team training amid reports of a fee agreement with Chelsea.Now that agreement has been denied by Brighton, but it does make it seem like Cucurella is moving closer to getting his transfer request. Keep an eye on this space. (NM)August 4 – Chelsea considering Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dealAccording to the Daily Telegraph, Chelsea are considering a move for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The 33-year-old joined Barcelona in January but given the financial restrictions at Barca, plus the fact that they continue to sign new players, it appears that the Catalan club are offering up the Gabonese superstar. Why? Well, it is all about money. Per the report, Aubameyang’s wages will rise next year and Barcelona want to avoid paying that.Would Aubameyang be a good fit for Chelsea? He would fit their system and we know he’s a great finisher. Aubameyang could also add plenty of experience to a very youthful attack and if he’s happy and teams are playing to his strengths. Thomas Tuchel will be wary of Aubameyang potential throwing his toys out of the pram like he did at Arsenal but the player and coach know each other extremely well from their time together at Borussia Dortmund, which was hugely successful for Auba.With Kalidou Koulibaly coming in at center back, Chelsea have proved they are willing to sign winners, leaders and experienced stars to balance their largely youthful squad. Aubameyang fits the bill but the jury may be out as to whether he can fit into their fluid 3-4-2-1 system as the lone forward. (JPW)August 4 – Carney Chukwuemeka signsIt’s official: one of the top midfield prospects in the game has joined Chelsea from Aston Villa. Carney Chukwuemeka, 18, left Villa with less than a year left on his contract and Chelsea have pounced to sign the central midfielder. Chukwuemeka is expected to go straight into Thomas Tuchel’s first team squad and once again Chelsea are putting faith in youth.

According to Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea will pay $60.7 million to Brighton, who will also receive a top prospect, 19-year-old defender Levi Colwill, in the exchange. Colwill was a standout performer for nearly-promoted Championship side Huddersfield Town last season, as he appeared in 29 league games as a teenager. Manchester City, who previously made a run at signing the 24-year-old Cucurella, weren’t willing to go up to $60 million in their negotiations, let alone with a first team-ready prospect also included.

Rather than lose him for nothing in next summer, Steven Gerrard’s Villans have sold Chukwuemeka to the Blues for a reported $24 million. Not a bad return. (NM)August 1 – Marc Cucurella in shock move?Marc Cucurella’s move to Manchester City appears to have collapsed as the reigning Premier League champs won’t up their offer. But that doesn’t mean the Spanish left back won’t be playing in the Champions League this season… A report from the Daily Mail says that Chelsea are ready to sign Cucurella and will offer cash plus promising center back Levi Colwill. Other reports have since stated that talks between Chelsea and Brighton are advanced. With Chelsea set to let Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta move on this summer, they need defensive reinforcements and this could be a good deal for all involved. Cucurella has told Brighton he wants to move but Man City aren’t willing to pay what Brighton want for him (close to $60 million) so it appeared he would not get his dream move and would stay at Brighton and be unhappy. However, this could be a very good compromise. (JPW)\nChelsea are pushing to hijack Marc Cucurella deal!

Per the report, Chelsea will also sell Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso to Barcelona and then spend $82 million on the Dutch midfielder. De Jong, 25, has been linked with a move to Manchester United all summer long but doesn’t appear to be keen on playing for a team not in the UEFA Champions League. Chelsea are of course in the Champions League and with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho coming towards the end of their careers, Thomas Tuchel needs to look to the future. The report also says Barca will make a move for Bernardo Silva if they sell De Jong, as the Catalan club have spoken glowingly about the Man City and Portugal star over the last few months.As for De Jong, his sublime control on the ball and positioning would be pretty perfect for Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 system. He and Mateo Kovacic could hold things down together for the next five years. Now, the main issue is whether or not De Jong wants to leave Barcelona. Up to now he’s said he’s very happy at Barca but club president Joan Laporta and his manager Xavi continue to put pressure on him. Both keep saying they don’t want to sell him but they also mention the ‘economic situation’ as reports suggest Frenkie de Jong is being asked to take a wage cut, even though he is reportedly owed close to $20 million in wage deferrals from 2020. If Chelsea pip Manchester United to signing Frenkie de Jong then Erik ten Hag will not be a happy man as he will lose out on the player he wants to build his midfield around, while a top four rival will also be strengthened. (JPW)July 31 – Chelsea “working on deals” for defenders Wesley Fofana, Denzel DumfriesChelsea’s interest in Leicester City center back Wesley Fofana was first reported this week, and the Blues have reportedly decided to press forward in their pursuit of the 21-year-old Frenchman (not yet capped at senior level for France). A deal won’t come cheap for Chelsea, though, as David Ornstein reported on Sunday that Leicester value Fofana at $100 million, give or take a few million either way. Fofana burst onto the Premier League scene as a 19-year-old in his first season with the Foxes before suffering a broken leg on the eve of the 2021-22 season, keeping him out of action from August to mid-March.Inter Milan right back Denzel Dumfries is another name reportedly high atop Thomas Tuchel’s shopping list, with captain Cesar Azpilicueta set to turn 33 later this month and frequently linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old Dutch international (35 caps) joined Inter last summer and won the Coppa Italia in his first season at the San Siro. (AE)July 27 – Chelsea interested in Wesley FofanaOur partners in the UK at Sky Sports are reporting that Chelsea are interested in Leicester City center back Wesley Fofana. The French defender, 21, missed most of last season after breaking his leg in preseason but is highly-regarded as one of the top young defenders in Europe under the age of 22. Fofana only recently signed a new two-year contract extension at Leicester and it would take a pretty massive offer to sign him. Chelsea are desperate for central defenders, though, as Kalidou Koulibaly has arrived this summer but they lost Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger on free transfers to Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively.With the future of Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso still up in the air amid interest from Barcelona, plus long-term target Jules Kounde looking likely to sign for Barcelona instead of Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel has cut a frustrated figure in recent weeks, especially after their 4-0 friendly defeat to Arsenal. He wants his squad to be settled heading into the opening weekend of the new season but that seems very unlikely. Fofana would be a good signing for Chelsea. His quality is clear for all to see and he would slot in well to the 3-4-2-1 system and is very comfortable on the ball and coming out of the back to start attacks. Leicester would ask for a huge transfer fee for him as they know Chelsea are getting pretty desperate, but the fee could be one worth paying as Chelsea are running out of time, and options. (JPW)July 26 – Denzel Dumfries, center backs now top of Chelsea’s listThomas Tuchel isn’t happy with the amount of players Chelsea have been able to sign this summer and now that it appears that Jules Kounde will be heading to Barcelona instead of Stamford Bridge, the race to sign defenders is well and truly on. A report from 90min says that Pau Torres, Josko Gvardiol and Milan Skriniar are three center back options Chelsea are looking at closely, while Bayern Munich duo Dayot Upamecano and Benjamin Pavard could also be options. Torres and Pavard seem the most likely signings for Chelsea from that lengthy list of defenders as Tuchel needs reinforcements in defense for Chelsea to have any chance of mounting a serious title challenge this season. Right now, Chelsea will line up with Thiago Silva, Kalidou Koulibaly and probably Cesar Azpilicueta at center back for the opening day of the season in their 3-4-2-1 formation. However, Azpilicueta could leave for Barcelona but if the Catalan club sign Jules Kounde ahead of Chelsea that could actually scupper Azpilicueta’s move to Barcelona.If Azpilicueta does move on then Denzel Dumfries will likely arrive at right wing-back, with the Dutch international said to be Chelsea’s main target for that position according to the London Evening Standard. The Inter Milan defender, 26, could play as the right wing-back in the 3-4-2-1 formation and Reece James could switch to be the right-sided center back for Chelsea. That could solve their center back issue, at least in the short-term, as Chelsea will likely bring in a new central defender (or two) before the transfer window shuts on September 1. Things are getting very interesting for Tuchel and the new Chelsea owners as deals need to be completed fast if they’re going to seriously compete for trophies this season. (JPW)July 26 – Timo Werner could leave ChelseaFabrizio Romano has indicated that Timo Werner could leave Chelsea this summer, with Juventus and RB Leipzig linked with a move for the German international. Werner’s comments during preseason upset Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, as the striker revealed he could be happy at whatever club he was playing at. After struggling for goals, and minutes, during the 2021-22 campaign, Werner’s playing time could be reduced further this season after the arrival of Raheem Sterling. Werner, 26, is loved by Chelsea fans for his work rate but he has scored just 10 goals in 56 Premier League games over the last two seasons and 23 goals in 89 appearances in all competitions. He has been guilty of snatching at big chances and not being clinical enough in front of goal.Another report from Bild in Germany states that Newcastle want to sign Werner. Heading to Newcastle or back to Leipzig seems like a very good move for Werner, with the former probably his best bet. In the right system he will cause havoc but Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 formation just doesn’t suit his style of play and he is much better in a team that plays two up front or a traditional 4-3-3 where wide players are forwards. Werner wants to lock in his spot in Germany’s World Cup roster and playing regularly has to be his aim between now and November. He isn’t going to get that at Chelsea as Sterling, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech all appear to be ahead of him in the pecking order for the three attacking roles. (JPW)\nTimo Werner could really leave Chelsea this summer.

Koulibaly, 31, is exactly the kind of center back Chelsea needed to rebuild their defense and Tuchel has added real quality in Koulibaly and Sterling. Who’s next? Probably another few defenders with Presnel Kimpembe and Jules Kounde targeted. Koulibaly is perfect for the 3-4-2-1 formation and will replace Antonio Rudiger as the commanding force in the Chelsea defense who will step out and be aggressive. Koulibaly and Thiago Silva have plenty of experience and it will be intriguing to see who Thomas Tuchel lines up alongside them this season.

It seems like this deal for 18-year-old USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina has dragged on and on, but there is no real rush on either side as Slonina will be heading back to the Chicago Fire on loan. As we’ve said below, Slonina will eventually head to Chelsea over the next year or so and his next step is to head out on loan in Europe. The American goalkeeper has a very bright future and this is a good move for him to enter the European market and have a huge club like Chelsea handling his development.

The center back, 27, was linked with a move back to Chelsea but that won’t happen and according to reports, the Blues aren’t delighted about the move stalling late on. With Presnel Kimpembe potentially on his way to partner Kalidou Koulibaly, Chelsea should have plenty of options at center back but probably need one more signing to back-up Thiago Silva and Cesar Azpilicueta (if he stays) as youngster Levi Colwill will also be on the move.

Sterling will be the main man in attack for Thomas Tuchel and will give him them the clinical edge and pace they need in attack. This is a massive upgrade for Chelsea and proves the ambition of their new owners, as Sterilng will excel in the 3-4-2-1 formation in one of the underneath roles, or even up top as the central striker. (JPW)\nHe\'s here! 😁#SterlingIsChelsea\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 13, 2022July 12 – Blues interested in Serge Gnabry?A report from the Daily Mail claims that Chelsea have turned their attention to Serge Gnabry after Raphinha appears to be heading to Barcelona. Gnabry, 26, is valued at $53 million by Bayern Munich and the Germany international has just one year left on his contract, with Chelsea reaching out to Bayern about his availability. The silky winger creates and scores goals galore and with Chelsea set to add Raheem Sterling and chasing other forward options, it is clear Thomas Tuchel wants to freshen up his attack. Romelu Lukaku has been loaned out to Inter Milan, Hakim Ziyech could be leaving for AC Milan, while the likes of Christian Pulisic and Timo Werner have also been linked with moves away.Would Gnabry slot in well at Chelsea? Everything suggests so. He is versatile, clinical in the final third and along with Sterling would give Chelsea’s attacking unit a totally different look. Tuchel prefers to play without a target forward and Sterling and Gnabry could start underneath Havertz, or one of them could even start up top with Mason Mount in the attacking midfield position. Gnabry would give Tuchel flexibility and the German coach loves that from his team. Gnabry doesn’t appear to be closer to agreeing a new contract at Bayern Munich and Chelsea could take advantage of that situation. (JPW)July 12 – Nathan Ake, Kalidou Koulibaly lined upAccording to Fabrizio Romano, Napoli and Senegal center back Kalidou Koulibaly remains on Chelsea’s wish list as they aim to sign new center back. Negotiations for Nathan Ake are continuing too, as Thomas Tuchel looks to rebuild his defense. Matthijs de Ligt seems to be heading to Bayern Munich from Juventus, so Chelsea have given up pursuing the Dutch center back. Koulibaly has a huge contract offer on the table from Napoli but per the report, talks with his agent have continued and he is seen as a key man for the Blues.David Ornstein is now reporting that Chelsea are even closer to signing Koulibaly for a deal worth over $40 million.\n🚨 Chelsea close to agreements on fee + personal terms to sign Kalidou Koulibaly.

In a word, huge. After losing Antonio Rudiger to Real Madrid and Andreas Christensen to Barcelona on free transfers, captain Cesar Azpilicueta could also be heading to Barca and that leaves Chelsea very short in defense. Ake and Koulibaly would be perfect fits for Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 system and Koulibaly would be a very good direct replacement for Antonio Rudiger. Koulibaly will be expensive but he does have just one year left on his contract at Napoli and the 31-year-old may feel like now is the time to take his talents to the Premier League after what seems like constant links in every single transfer window of the last five years. (JPW)July 12 – Gabriel Slonina deal back on?Just when it looked like USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina, 18, would not be heading to Chelsea, it appears the deal is back on. According to Fabrizio Romano, a deal for Slonina is back in the works as Todd Boehly is dealing with it personally. The American goalkeeper is regarded as one of the top young prospects in the world and Real Madrid were said to be pushing Chelsea to sign him. Per the report, Slonina will stay at Chicago Fire on loan and the deal will be worth over $10 million plus add ons. It appears that Slonina will be one for the future for Chelsea as Edouard Mendy will be their goalkeeper for many years to come. That said, Slonina could come in as the No. 2 in the next few years and gain valuable experience, plus this move opens up the opportunity to head elsewhere in Europe on loan. (JPW)\nChelsea have reached verbal agreement with Chicago Fire for Gabriel Slonina, after direct talks between Todd Boehly and MLS club. 10m deal plus add-ons, he\'d stay at Chicago on loan. 🔵🇺🇸 #CFC \nChelsea are expected to submit official bid this week in order to get the deal done. pic.twitter.com/965dJHuI6w\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) July 11, 2022July 12 – Raphinha edging closer to Barcelona moveThis really has become a saga but it appears that Raphinha’s move to Barcelona is closer to completion. Fabrizio Romano has said that Leeds have finally accepted a bid from Barca and now the only wait is until the Catalan club can afford to register Raphinha and complete the deal. Raphinha, 25, was wanted by a host of Premier League clubs and it looked like he would join Chelsea after they had a bid accepted. However, his dream has always been to play for Barcelona and the Brazil international looks to have got his move with Chelsea now moving for Raheem Sterling and perhaps another wide forward (see above). As for Raphinha, he will play a key role at Barcelona who are likely to move on plenty of other players this summer as Xavi freshens up his squad. It is quite likely that Raphinha, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres will be Barcelona’s main men in attack. (JPW)July 11 – Manchester United, Arsenal linked with Kante moveNow, N’Golo Kante is still probably in the top three defensive midfielders in the world when he’s fully fit, so why would Chelsea sell him? Kante, 31, has just one year left on his contract at Chelsea and it appears he may be ready for a new challenge. With that in mind, the Daily Star claims that Manchester United want to rival Arsenal to sign Kante this summer. Kante is currently in the UK and not on Chelsea’s preseason tour of the U.S. due to his vaccination status not allowing him to enter the United States of America.Should Chelsea cash in on Kante now? They will likely get close to $50 million for him if they sold him this summer and the French international struggled increasingly with injuries last season. When he’s fit and firing on all cylinders there are still few defensive midfielders better than him in the world but it seems like Thomas Tuchel wants to freshen up his midfield options with Jorginho also coming towards the end of his contract at Stamford Bridge and plenty of replacements, such as Matheus Nunes and Frenkie de Jong, have been linked with Chelsea in recent weeks. (JPW)July 6 – Chelsea, Man City reportedly agree Sterling feeRaheem Sterling has agreed to join Chelsea after seven seasons at Manchester City, according to multiple reports.The 27-year-old England star would move with the World Cup coming up, and the move could alter the club futures for fellow international stars Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, and Hakim Ziyech.What would this transfer mean for Chelsea? More details and analysis, here. (NM)July 6 – Blues set to bid for Sporting Lisbon’s Matheus NunesAccording to a report from A Bola in Portugal, Chelsea are set to bid for Sporting Lisbon midfielder Matheus Nunes. Per the report, Chelsea will bid over $45 million to sign the silky, two-way central midfielder. Could that mean the likes of Jorginho (who was linked with Juventus) may leave Chelsea this summer? Thomas Tuchel and new chairman Todd Boehly — who is also acting as a temporary head of recruitment — are trying to make plenty of moves as they are chasing Nathan Ake, Jules Kounde and Matthijs de Ligt to strengthen their defense, plus chasing deals for Raheem Sterling, Raphinha and Cristiano Ronaldo. Apparently the idea of Nunes heading to Chelsea came up with Jorge Mendes (also Ronaldo’s agent) met with Boehly recently.What type of player is Nunes? He’s a creative box-to-box midfielder who loves to dictate the tempo of the game and the 23-year-old is regarded as one of the top young midfielders in the game. Is this an area of the pitch Chelsea need to strengthen? Potentially. Jorginho is getting towards the end of his career, Kante was injury prone last season and Mateo Kovacic also had injury issues. Nunes seems to be exactly the kind of midfielder Tuchel likes in his 3-4-2-1 system as he gets on the ball, drives forward, keeps it well and is precise with his passing. (JPW)July 6 – Chelsea could move for Benjamin PavardBenjamin Pavard is reportedly a target for Chelsea, according to the Daily Mirror. And our partners at Sky in Germany believe that the 26-year-old could move on from Bayern Munich this summer after the reigning German champs signed Noussair Mazaroui from Ajax. Per the report Chelsea believe that their main defensive target, Matthijs de Ligt, could be heading to Bayern instead so they are lining up alternatives. As for Pavard, he is a right back primarily but is very comfortable playing anywhere in defense and the French international has an eye for goal and can deliver real quality on the ball going forward.Pavard is exactly the kind of player who would slot into Thomas Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 formation seamlessly and this feels like a long-term replacement for Cesar Azpilicueta. Chelsea have been linked with plenty of players in recent weeks as the new ownership have finally arrived at the club and chairman Todd Boehly is trying to get plenty of deals done before the Blues head on their tour of the U.S. this summer. Pavard would be perfect and with Nathan Ake, Prisnel Kimpembe and Jules Kounde all linked with a move to Chelsea, defensive reinforcements are right at the top of Tuchel’s wish-list after Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger moved on this summer. (JPW)July 6 – Gabriel Slonina’s move to Chelsea appears to be offIt seems like Gabriel Slonina, 18, will not be heading to Chelsea. According to the London Evening Standard, a deal for Slonina to head to Stamford Bridge has been halted. Real Madrid and Wolves have also been linked with a move for the Chicago Fire product, who was close to joining Chelsea in January before sanctions were placed on the club and several key individuals on the recruitment side have since left. Slonina is highly-rated and has already been in the full USMNT squad as he continues to shine in MLS week after week. His future definitely lies in Europe but it seems like he won’t be signing for Chelsea. (JPW)July 4 – Chelsea once again linked with Cristiano Ronaldo moveA report from The Athletic claims that Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly has been in talks with Jorge Mendes about a potential deal for Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, 37, has reportedly told United he wants to move on this summer and he did not turn up for the first day of preseason due to ‘family reasons’ as it appears his second spell at Old Trafford is coming to an abrupt end. Per this report, Chelsea are exploring if they could do a deal for Ronaldo but there are apparently some hestitations from Thomas Tuchel about Ronaldo being a good fit for the Blues.Would this work? Firstly, it would be shocking if Man United sold Ronaldo to a direct top four rival in the Premier League. Why would they do that? Ronaldo is under contract for another season so they would rather keep him against his will for one season rather than strengthen a rival. Secondly, it’s quite clear that Ronaldo would score plenty of goals at Chelsea but would his arrival upset the balance of the squad as it did at United? The second point is wading into muddy waters as Chelsea have had success in bringing in a superstar veteran (Thiago Silva) and if Ronaldo is willing to work with their talented youngsters, he will get plenty of chances to score. Chelsea need a new No. 9 after loaning out Romelu Lukaku and Ronaldo wants to play in the Champions League, which Chelsea are in. On the face of it, this makes sense for everyone aside from Manchester United. That is the big problem. (JPW)July 4 – Contrasting reports over Chelsea’s push to sign Raheem SterlingOur partners in the UK at Sky Sports have heard contrasting reports when it comes to Raheem Sterling to Chelsea. One source said a fee is close to being agreed, while another played that down. What we do know is that Thomas Tuchel wants to sign Sterling, 27, and now is probably a good time for him to move on from Man City. Sterling has one year left on his contract at City and Pep Guardiola rotated him in and out of the team more than he would have liked last season. Sterling would be a big upgrade on Chelsea’s current attacking options and Tuchel wants to inject more pace and incisiveness into his attack. Sterling would provide that and even if many believe he should have scored more goals for City, he has still banged in 131 goals in 339 appearances over the last seven seasons and has been ridiculously consistent. (JPW)July 4 – Christian Pulisic not keen to leave Chelsea despite Juventus interestChristian Pulisic has a big summer ahead of him as the USMNT star will be thinking long and hard about his future at club level. Should he stay at Chelsea? Should he leave? Where should he go? The latest report on his situation is from\xa0The Daily Mail, as they say Christian Pulisic wants to stay at Chelsea despite interest in him from Juventus. Per the report, Pulisic is not keen on a move to Juve.This follows a report on his future from\xa0The Daily Telegraph, as they said that Chelsea have offered Juventus one of Pulisic and Timo Werner, plus cash, for Matthijs de Ligt. Of course, USMNT fans will be hoping whatever happens with Christian Pulisic at Chelsea will be best for the U.S. ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This is a very tough decision for Pulisic as he could stay at Chelsea but move behind Raheem Sterling, and other potential new signings, in the pecking order. Or he could head somewhere else and it may take him time to settle in too. It really is a 50/50 decision for the American star and it also depends heavily on whether or not Thomas Tuchel plans on giving him a big role this season. (JPW)June 30 – Blues want to bring back Nathan AkeOnce a Chelsea prospect, Dutch defender Nathan Ake is wanted by Thomas Tuchel for the first team at Stamford Bridge.The 27-year-old ex-Bournemouth star has not played as much as he’d like at Manchester City but the Premier League champions rate him much higher than the proposed Chelsea bid.The Blues are said to be willing to offer around $36 million, about half of the reported City valuation. What fee would it take to get City to sell a player to a would-be title rival. If Gabriel Jesus moved to London for $55 million, albeit with less time on his deal, perhaps that’s nearer to the bullseye. (NM)June 29 – Romelu Lukaku loaned back to Inter MilanFULL STORYRomelu Lukaku to Inter Milan confirmed: Lukaku’s second spell at Chelsea came to another unceremonious end on Wednesday, when Inter Milan re-signed the Belgian striker on a season-long loan.This time around, Lukaku scored 15 goals in 44 appearances (all competitions – 8 in 26 in the Premier League), bringing his Chelsea career total to 15 goals. In total, Chelsea have paid roughly $155 million for Lukaku. Quick math says, $10 million per goal. (AE)June 28 – Chelsea, Leeds reportedly agree fee for RaphinhaThe Todd Boehly revolution is well underway at Stamford Bridge, where Brazilian attacker Raphinha is set to arrive from Leeds United.It’s a deal that could reach $80 million, according to Fabrizio Romano, and certainly loads up Jesse Marsch’s transfer kitty at Leeds.This, of course, assumes that Chelsea can come to an agreement on a contract with Raphinha, who has also been linked with Barcelona and Arsenal.Raphinha scored 11 times with three assists for Leeds last Premier League season, a year after scoring six times and adding nine assists following a transfer from Stade Rennais.What a move this would be for a Chelsea team already loaded with attackers, just the latest sign that no one besides (probably) Kai Havertz and Mason Mount are safe in their status with Thomas Tuchel’s Blues. Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic, and others all could move by the end of the window.All that said… you still need center backs to contend for a league, too. It’s not even July 1, though, so this transfer season may just be warming up. (NM)June 27 – Chelsea consider Richarlison bidIs there a winger Chelsea don’t want to sign this summer!? After being linked with moves for Raheem Sterling and Ousmane Dembele in recent days and weeks, our partners in the UK at Sky Sports are now stating that Chelsea want to rival Tottenham to try and sign Richarlison. The 25-year-old Brazilian is a man in demand and has apparently told Frank Lampard he wants to leave Everton this summer and wants to play in the Champions League. With Chelsea letting Romelu Lukaku leave on loan, plus the likes of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic all likely to move on this summer, it appears that Thomas Tuchel is seriously freshening up his attack as Chelsea’s new owners try to make a splash.Would Richarlison to Chelsea make sense? Actually, yes, it would. A lot of sense. Richarlison is a mobile forward who can plan centrally in Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 formation but he can also play as one of the underneath forwards. If Chelsea signed Richarlison, Sterling and Dembele this summer, then that would be a huge upgrade on their current attacking options and all three players would suit Tuchel very well. Richarlison would probably cost upwards of $65 million, with Sterling slightly less expensive and Dembele is available on a free. If Chelsea move on Ziyech, Werner and Pulisic for decent fees, or even decent loan fees, then this could work out very well. Defensively they still need a couple of new center backs but new chairman Todd Boehly is certainly busy early on at Chelsea as Petr Cech and Marina Granovskaia are both out and he’s taking a leading role in lining up these transfers, at least on an interim basis to start with. (JPW)June 26 – Thomas Tuchel makes contact with Raheem SterlingA report from The Telegraph states that Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has reached out directly to Raheem Sterling to discuss a possible move to Stamford Bridge this summer. The England international, 27, could well be surplus to requirements at Manchester City next season and Chelsea need to freshen up their attack. With Romelu Lukaku on his way to Inter Milan, Hakim Ziyech in talks over a loan move to AC Milan and Timo Werner likely leaving too, it’s clear that Tuchel wants to rebalance his attack and Sterling is one of his top targets. Per the report, City value Sterling at $61-73 million and Chelsea will now make a bid after Tuchel spoke directly with the player.Would this be a good move for both Sterling and Chelsea? Probably. Sterling has been a star at Man City over the last seven seasons but he probably isn’t appreciated as much as he should be and with Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez arriving this summer at City, the speedy winger will face even stiffer competition for a starting spot. He struggled for minutes a little last season (2127 compared to 2537 in 2020-21) but his quality is clear for all to see. The way he stretches teams on the break and cuts inside would suit Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 system well, as Sterling could play as the central striker or as one of the two underneath forwards. Sterling has just one year left on his current contract at City and with Gabriel Jesus set to leave this summer for Arsenal, are City going to allow both to move on? Maybe. They have always been pretty good at letting players move on if they want to but Pep Guardiola may feel a little shorthanded if both Sterling and Jesus leave this summer. (JPW)June 26 – Cristiano Ronaldo linked with shock move to Stamford BridgeYes, this is actually a real thing. And yes, Manchester United have denied it could happen. However, there is clearly a bit of a theme rumbling behind-the-scenes here. In the past week there have been reports suggesting Ronaldo is unhappy with the lack of new signings at United, plus there have been reports linking him with a move to Roma, his former club Sporting Lisbon and now Chelsea are said to be interested in signing the Portuguese superstar. According to The Athletic, new Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly discussed the availability of Ronaldo, 37, when he met with ‘super-agent’ Jorge Mendes.Per the report, Ronaldo was discussed and Chelsea are interested in seeing whether or not he can be temped to west London. Given that he only has one year left on his contract and they’d be strengthening a direct top four rival, United would surely rather keep Ronaldo than sell him to Chelsea this summer. United have since briefed plenty of outlets, including our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, that Ronaldo is not for sale and will not leave this summer.But would having an unhappy Ronaldo around be a huge problem for Erik ten Hag? Probably. His love for United is undoubted but it is easier to see why he’s so frustrated. Many believe he will not fit into the tactics deployed by ETH but the Dutch coach is said to believe he can. Let’s see how this goes but it seems like Ronaldo’s future is unexpectedly going to be the topic of much discussion this summer.\xa0(JPW)June 25 – Hakim Ziyech to AC Milan?; Tuchel expecting ‘up to six new players to arrive’A report from our partners at Sky Italy states that Hakim Ziyech could head on loan to AC Milan in a similar deal which will see Romelu Lukaku move to Inter from Chelsea. Per the report, Ziyech is keen on the move and he has been a target for AC Milan for some time. The Moroccan winger has never really settled at Chelsea despite the odd sublime goal and stunning display. With Tuchel looking to freshen up his attack this summer, Ziyech, Werner, Lukaku and even Christian Pulisic appear to be surplus to requirements as Tuchel expects plenty of new arrivals under the new ownership group led by Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly. According to a separate report from The Telegraph the Blues boss expects up to six new players to arrive at Stamford Bridge this summer. With De Ligt, Raheem Sterling, Richarlison and Ousmane Dembele strongly linked with a move to Chelsea, this is going to be a very different looking side, especially in attack. (JPW)June 25 – Timo Werner part of potential deal for De Ligt?A report from Di Marzio in Italy suggests that Timo Werner plus $35 million is the offer Chelsea have put forward for Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt but the Turin club want Werner and closer to $45 million. Per the report both Werner and De Ligt are up for the move, with the Dutch center back set to be the new center-piece of Thomas Tuchel’s defense, while Werner is keen for a fresh start in Italy as his goalscoring woes in the Premier League continue. Would this be a good move for all parties? De Ligt has been much better in recent seasons at Juve but he has struggled at times and perhaps the Premier League would suit his game slightly better. As for Werner, well, he’s beloved by the Chelsea fans for his incredible effort in games but his finishing has really let him down and if he moves on now he can leave with his head held high. (JPW)June 23 – Matthijs de Ligt transfer would set defender recordJuventus center back Matthijs de Ligt’s $126 million release clause and its expectation not to budge much from the price tag may not stop Chelsea, according to Sky Sports.The Blues are pursuing the 22-year-old Dutch star, having lost Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen this summer. Chelsea has to address the crew of Thiago Silva, Malang Sarr, and Trevoh Chalobah.De Ligt cost Juventus about $79 million from Ajax. Amongst defenders, only Virgil van Dijk, Harry Maguire, and Lucas Hernandez have cost more than De Ligt’s transfer fee then and only four players have cost more than his current release clause, which expires in 2024.Should it happen, this would be huge splash from new chairman Todd Boehly? (NM).June 21 – Chelsea linked with RicharlisonIt appears that Richarlison is a man in demand this summer as The Daily Mail reports that Chelsea are set to battle with Tottenham and Arsenal for his signature. The 25-year-old looks likely to leave Everton and it is believed that Thomas Tuchel is a big fan of the Brazilian international. With Romelu Lukaku on his way out, plus doubts over whether or not Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner will stick around, Chelsea are set to freshen up their attacking options. They’ve already been linked with moves for Raheem Sterling and Ousmane Dembele this summer and bringing in a wide forward who is comfortable cutting inside seems a priority.Richarlison can certainly do that and given his experience in the Premier League and his tenacity and work-rate, he seems like a very good fit for Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 system at Chelsea as he could play up top or in one of the two underneath positions. The transfer fee is going to be sizeable (probably $60-70 million) but Richarlison has been consistent at Everton and there’s reason to believe he will create and score plenty of goals in a team who are on the front-foot more often. (JPW)June 21 – West Ham set to bid $37 million for Armando BrojaAccording to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, West Ham are set to bid $37 million to sign young Chelsea and Albania striker Armando Broja. The 20-year-old had a very solid season on loan at Southampton last season as he scored nine goals in all competitions and showed plenty of promise despite playing in a team which struggled to create plenty of chances. Broja may be needed at Chelsea this season as they look set to sell Romelu Lukaku, but per the report the likes of Newcastle, Arsenal and Napoli also want to sign the powerful striker. West Ham seems like a very good fit for Broja as he would compete with Michail Antonio for minutes and the pair could be rotated as the Hammers have the Europa Conference League and Premier League to juggle. Broja is good on the counter, deceptively quick and is very aggressive and that suits West Ham’s style under David Moyes very well. (JPW)June 19 – Chelsea want to sign Raheem SterlingThe Blues are getting going in the transfer market and a report from our partners in the UK at Sky Sports states that Chelsea want to sign Raheem Sterling. Per the report, it would take a bid of over $73 million for City to let Sterling go this summer. The England forward, still just 27 years old, is out of contract next summer and it seems like he could be set for a move this summer.Would this be a good move for Chelsea, and Sterling? It seems like a pretty good fit and if Chelsea can drive down the price a little, they will go all-in for Sterling. That said, City could be selling to potential title rivals so they will want a big transfer fee.Sterling is not really and out-and-out winger and Tuchel doesn’t like to play with pure wingers in his 3-4-2-1 system. He would be very good on the left of the two forwards underneath a central striker and he loves to cut inside and cause havoc. Even though Sterling gets a bad rep for missing big chances he has still scored 62 goals in all competitions for Man City over the last three seasons. That’s 20 goals per season and Chelsea need someone what that production in their forward line as Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech have all struggled to stay fit and in-form. With Erling Haaland arriving this summer at City, Sterling could well struggle for playing time this season at City and he has been in and out of the team over the last 12 months. He could play centrally at Chelsea, as the report suggests, and Tuchel is said to be a big fan of Sterling. Add in all of that to the fact that Sterling grew up in west London and his family connections are in the area and it all kind of makes sense, right? (JPW)June 11 – USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina chased by Chelsea, Real MadridAccording to Fabrizio Romano, a potential deal for USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina, 18, is entering ‘important hours’ as Chelsea and Real Madrid are the frontrunners to sign him. The Chicago Fire goalkeeper has been a Chelsea target for many months and now they have their ownership situation figured out, they can start trying to sign players once again.Should Slonina sign for Real or Chelsea? He’s not going to play for either team regularly but it would allow him to develop next to some of the best goalkeepers in the world and also go out on loan in Europe to gain valuable experience. (JPW)\nImportant hours ahead for Gabriel Slonina transfer. Real Madrid made official bid turned down by Chicago Fire last week – but Chelsea are also in talks to sign him, after being really close last February 🚨🇺🇸 #CFC\nDecision to be made soon – gonna be one of MLS record transfers. pic.twitter.com/yrAYjITU6T\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 11, 2022June 10 – Four players join Antonio Rudiger in leaving Chelsea as free agentsAndreas Christensen, Charly Musonda, Danny Drinkwater and Jake Clarke-Salter have all left Chelsea as free agents. After Antonio Rudiger left as a free agent and signed for Real Madrid, this quartet were also expected to leave at the end of their deals. Chelsea had been keen to keep Danish center back Christensen around but he is expected to join Barcelona this summer.If that move doesn’t happen due to Barca’s financial situation, Christensen will not be short of options. With the futures of Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Romelu Lukaku and several other forwards (see below) uncertain, it is building up to be a very intriguing summer at Chelsea. And, oh yeah, they also have new billionaire owners who are keen to make their mark. (JPW)June 9 – Chelsea could also sell Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, Hakim ZiyechThomas Tuchel is going to be remaking Chelsea’s defense this summer, but the attack may also see a shift In personnel as the Blues are reportedly willing to listen to offers for\xa0Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, and Christian Pulisic.Of course, one of those names will jump off the page on this site. Pulisic, 23, has made no secret of his desire to play and there are plenty of clubs who’d welcome the chance to give him that opportunity.Pulisic and Werner are on the list of CIES’ top 100 transfer values in the world, and could fetch a pretty penny for a Chelsea club who may also be losing a third name on that list: Romelu Lukaku.Was he really underutilized last season, and is the same true for Werner? or Ziyech? Or Lukaku? We take a deeper dive here (NM).June 8 – Chelsea want big money to loan Romelu Lukaku back to Inter MilanFollowing his failed return to Stamford Bridge this season, Romelu Lukaku is hoping to leave the club once again this summer. He wants to go back to Inter Milan, and Inter Milan would like to have him back, but there’s just one problem: Chelsea have already sunk roughly $155 million into the signing (transfer fee plus first season’s wages), thus they would like to be compensated (handsomely) in order to re-(un)-acquire the 29-year-old Belgian striker, even on loan. According to a report from the Guardian, the Blues could demand as much as $31 million for the initial loan fee, plus a significant chunk of Lukaku’s $21-million annual salary. (AE)June 8 – Ibrahim Sangare to Chelsea or Man UnitedPSV Eindhoven midfielder Ibrahim Sangare has been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea in reports that say the combative midfielder plans to be in the Premier League next season.Sangare, 24, has a $44 million release clause and three years left on his PSV contract, having moved from then-Ligue 2 side Toulouse at the start of 2020-21 season.He registered the third-most tackles in Eredivisie last season with 95 and the third-most interceptions with 74, chipping in three goals while passing the ball at nearly 87 percent. (NM)June 1 – Chelsea still interested in USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel ‘Gaga’ SloninaA report from Goal.com states that Chelsea are still interested in signing USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina. The 18-year-old is a starter for the Chicago Fire and recently turned down a call-up to the Poland national team to represent the USMNT. Real Madrid reportedly also want to sign Slonina, who is one of the top young goalkeeping prospects on the planet. Would this move be a good one for the young American? He’d almost certainly go out on loan and getting regular minutes is key as he wouldn’t be close to challenging Edouard Mendy for the starting spot. (JPW)May 31 – Romelu Lukaku could move back to Inter Milan on loanAccording to Fabrizio Romano, the Inter Milan board will meet with Lukaku’s reps today. He claims that Lukaku ‘dreams of a return’ to Inter but nothing has been discussed with Chelsea. Lukaku, 29, only joined Chelsea from Inter last summer for a huge $122.6 million fee. However, after a good start to the season his form dipped massively and he scored just eight Premier League goals in 16 starts. Chelsea’s attack was their main issue all season long and Tuchel wants to revamp it this summer as Lukaku, Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Christian Pulisic could all be on the move. It has been reported elsewhere that Lukaku could initially head back to Inter on loan. (JPW)\nInter board will meet Romelu Lukaku\'s laywer in the coming hours.

Chelsea have agreed to pay $32.6 million (plus add ons) for Gusto as the 19-year-old right defender is touted as one of the best young full backs in Europe.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)\nIs this the end for the USMNT star at Chelsea? According to a report in Marca, the agents of Christian Pulisic have said that AC Milan have opened talks with Chelsea about signing the winger. Pulisic, 24, is out injured for at least another month and after Chelsea signed Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix and Noni Madueke so far in January, they have loaded up on new attacking midfielders and wingers. Pulisic’s time at Stamford Bridge appears to be up as he has just 18 months left on his current contract. This move to Milan seems like it would be a very good one for Pulisic. They are the reigning Italian champs, have the likes of Olivier Giroud, Sergino Dest and Fikayo Tomori in their squad who know Pulisic well, and he will get regular minutes in a team which competes in the UEFA Champions League. On top of that, Serie A will suit his playing style better than the Premier League. (JPW)\nThere’s going to be change around Everton, and Chelsea may be taking advantage of it.\nThe Blues are said to be moving for Amadou Onana and Anthony Gordon, with the former coming on an immediate permanent move and the latter signing for Chelsea before a loan back to Everton for the rest of the season.\nThis is all according to Metro. At some point Chelsea won’t be able to spend more money but Everton needs it and seemingly Gordon’s figure has dropped a little given his drop down the Toffees’ pecking order.\nIt all seems wild, but this is Chelsea in 2022-23. (NM)\nA report from the Guardian says that Chelsea are going back in for Enzo Fernandez. Are failing to sign the Young Player of the 2022 World Cup earlier in January, the report says Chelsea are due to restart talks this week with Benfica about signing the Argentine star. The central midfielder is exactly what Graham Potter needs and his aggression, skill and drive from central areas was a huge reason for Argentina’s success at the World Cup. Fernandez was very keen on joining Chelsea but after talks stalled with Benfica he has refocused and has been playing well for the Portuguese giants. Still, Fernandez has made it clear he wants the move and Chelsea may try to pay less than his $131 million release clause.\nAnother report from Football.London says that Chelsea still want to sign Brighton’s 21-year-old midfielder Moises Caicedo. They say Chelsea have had a $68 million bid rejected by Brighton but the Blues are willing to go back in and will up their offer for their Ecuador star. Roberto De Zerbi has admitted it will be tough for Brighton to keep Caicedo but he would prefer if he left in the summer rather than January. Let’s see what offer Chelsea make next.

As they close in on a loan move for Joao Felix (see below), they are also reportedly interested in signing French international striker Marcus Thuram from Borussia Monchengladbach. According to The Times, Chelsea want to sign Thuram, 25, and his contract runs out in the summer. The forward was part of France’s 2022 World Cup squad and has the ability to lead the line but can also make runs in-behind to create space for others. With Christopher Nkunku expected to arrive this summer, plus Felix coming in and others linked, it looks like Chelsea want to overhaul their entire attacking unit. Thuram has scored 13 goals in 17 appearances in all competitions for ‘Gladbach this season and Chelsea desperately need someone to come in and add a clinical edge to their play.\nAccording to the same report, Chelsea are also interested in signing Noni Madueke, 20, from PSV Eindhoven. The England U21 winger has been linked with so many Premier League clubs in the past. His talent is undoubted but do Chelsea really need more wide attacking players right now? They have Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount, Hakim Ziyech, Raheem Sterling and are about to add Joao Felix to that mix. It seems like they could probably strengthen in other areas and it also seems like their recruitment plan hasn’t really been properly figured out with so many new figures joining their technical staff in recent months.\xa0(JPW)\nThis one came out of nowhere, right? Joao Felix is heading to Chelsea on loan from Atletico Madrid according to David Ornstein from The Athletic. Felix has stalled at Atleti and per the report, the Portugal international likes the project at Chelsea and has chosen to join them ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal. Given Chelsea’s current struggles under Graham Potter, particularly in the final third and creating and finishing off chances, Felix will be a great addition. In the right system he can be an excellent addition and he is able to play up top or across the attacking midfield roles.

The report states that Kante, 31, may well sign a new contract at Chelsea as it was feared he would leave as a free agent when his current deal expires in the summer of 2023. Keeping Kante around, and fit, will be key, but the report also suggests that Chelsea know signing a central midfielder is going to cost them a lot. But they’re keen to crack on and do it anyway. Rice is a former Chelsea academy star and has long been linked with a move back to Stamford Bridge, while Bellingham is obviously a superstar in the making and Premier League and European giants are lining up to sign him this summer. Chelsea will be in the mix and even though they have Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and Kante in central midfield, they are trying to lock down at least one world-class midfielder who will be the heartbeat of their team for the next five to six years.

A report from The Athletic states that Chelsea have offered to pay Leipzig more than Nkunku $60 million release clause (which kicks in next summer) and want to wrap up a deal which would see the 24-year-old French international arrive at Stamford Bridge next summer. The report says that Nkunku has already agreed to the deal, while our partners in the UK at Sky Sports believe the prolific striker (who has already scored six goals in eight Bundesliga games this season) has yet to make up his mind.\n\nNkunku scored 20 goals last season and added 13 assists as he was named the Bundesliga Player of the Season. His quality is undoubted and he would be a perfect forward addition to Chelsea’s fluid attacking system under Potter. Nkunku learning from Aubameyang, one of the most prolific strikers in the game, is surely a recipe for success. After moving on Timo Werner and Romelu Lukaku this summer, it is clear that Chelsea are keen to freshen up their attack and that could also mean the likes of Christian Pulisic, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech may be surplus to requirements.\nAt the other end of the pitch a report from the Daily Telegraph suggests that Chelsea are also looking to wrap up a deal to sign Leipzig’s Croatian center back Gvardiol. Per the report, Gvardiol has a release clause close to $45 million and Chelsea are willing to meet it. The 20-year-old is considered to be one of the top center back prospects in Europe and was chased by Chelsea, among many others, this summer. With Wesley Fofana and Kalidou Koulibaly signed up in the summer, Chelsea already have extensive, and quality, options at center back.

The arrival of Fofana takes Chelsea’s spending to over $290 million this summer, as he joins Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly and Marc Cucurella in signing for the Blues. Fofana will add class to Chelsea’s defense and is likely to line up alongside Thiago Silva and Koulibaly.

The tricky winger will hope playing regularly for Leverkusen, who are in the UEFA Champions League, will get him back to his best and help him make a late push for the England squad ahead of the World Cup this summer. After being linked with Newcastle, Leicester and Southampton, this is a good move for CHO and he will become a key man for Bayer in the Bundesliga. (JPW)\nA report from the Guardian says that Chelsea have renewed their interest in Wilfried Zaha as the Crystal Palace winger has less than a year left on his current contract. Zaha, 29, has been linked with Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal on multiple occasions over the years and a report from The Independent says his agent is pushing for a move to Chelsea. The Guardian says that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still Chelsea’s top target but Zaha is another option.\nZaha is probably the best player in the Premier League outside the top six. His brief spell at Manchester United as a youngster didn’t work out but he’s been consistently excellent for Palace and the South London club would be devastated to lose him. However, he has less than a year left on his contract so if they’re going to get anything for him, now is the time. Previously Palace wanted $90 million for Zaha, which is understandable given that he’s the focal point of their attack and one of the main reasons they’ve stayed in the Premier League consistently over the last eight seasons.\nChelsea are on the lookout for players who can provide more of a cutting edge in attack and Zaha definitely does that, while his pace, directness and trickery on the counter could give Thomas Tuchel exactly what he needs. Per the report from The Independent, Arsenal are also said to be interested in Zaha (they are chasing Pedro Neto from Wolves but he could prove too difficult to sign) as Mikel Arteta wants to sign one more attacking players before the window shuts. (JPW)\nIt seems like Chelsea and Leicester City have finally agreed a fee for Wesley Fofana, as The Athletic believe an agreement is in place.

Chelsea need a clinical finisher to put away the chances Tuchel’s side create game after game and having Auba, Raheem Sterling and Mason Mount in attack is a very good trio.

(AE)\nChelsea are set to step up their pursuit of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, as a meeting is scheduled to discuss doing a deal for Aubameyang. Per the report from Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea will soon make their opening bid to Barcelona for Aubameyang as the 33-year-old is a top target in the final weeks of the transfer window.\nAubameyang is loved by Thomas Tuchel and was lethal when he played up front for him at Borussia Dortmund. In fairness, Aubameyang has been lethal pretty much wherever he’s played. Barcelona boss Xavi is said to want to keep Aubameyang but given Barca’s financial situation, if a good offer comes in from Chelsea they may sell the Gabonese striker. For Chelsea, this is exactly what they need, as their draw at home against Tottenham proved their need for a clinical forward. (JPW)\nPierre Aubameyang deal. Meeting in the next hours, scheduled since last Sunday – main focus will be on the personal terms. Lenght of contract and salary will be discussed today with Chelsea. 🚨🔵 #CFC\nRight after, Chelsea will prepare their first official bid to Barcelona. pic.twitter.com/msuDbFNZuX\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) August 18, 2022\n\nThis is getting quite repetitive, isn’t it? Chelsea really want to sign Gordon, 21, and Everton really don’t want to sell him. The England U21 international is the next big star to come out of Everton’s academy and his importance to the Toffees, especially after losing Richarlison earlier this summer, is clear. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Chelsea have upped their bid to over $54 million but that still isn’t enough as Everton rejected it and don’t want to sell their prized asset. This will likely end in Chelsea offering over $65 million for Gordon, who has a couple of decent seasons in the PL and shown plenty of promise, and Everton accepting that. As much potential as Gordon has, that price would be enough for Frank Lampard to buy two proven internationals to replace him and strengthen elsewhere, probably up front. (JPW)\nAccording to multiple reports out of the UK, Chelsea offered Everton $48.2 million for 21-year-old midfielder Anthony Gordon, the breakout star and a rare bright spot in the Toffees’ 2021-22 season, but the Blues were swiftly rejected with a further bid expected in the not-so-distant future.\nIt would appear that, under the direction of new owner Todd Boehly, Chelsea have made it a priority to target young English talent in the transfer market. Less than two weeks ago, the Blues paid as much as $24.1 million to sign 18-year-old Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa. Now, the reported bid for Gordon. It’ll get rather expensive paying the domestic-talent premium for too many more young Lions, but it’s clear that Boehly and Co., are taking a long-range view of Chelsea’s future rather than focusing solely on the here and now. We’ll see how Thomas Tuchel feels about that, if he doesn’t get all the signings he feels he needs before transfer deadline day. (AE)\nChelsea continued to be linked with moves for Barcelona duo Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Our partners in the UK at Sky Sports say that De Jong, 25, is open to a move to Chelsea as they play in the Champions League. Per the report, Chelsea will match the $87 million bid Manchester United for Frenkie de Jong earlier this summer. However, the issue remains that De Jong is owed over $20 million in deferred wages and Barcelona also want him to take a pay cut if he is to stay at the Nou Camp. Hence a few reasons why he could be on the move. But seriously, who knows what is going to happen at Barcelona from one day to the next right now!?\nWhen it comes to Aubameyang, there is definitely interest from both parties as the Gabonese striker, 33, has fallen down the pecking order at Barcelona after the summer arrivals of Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha. Aubameyang has three years left on his Barcelona contract but is said to be open to a return to the Premier League and London. He thrived under current Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel when the duo worked together at Borussia Dortmund and you can see him slotting in very nicely as the lone forward in Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 formation. As for De Jong, well, Chelsea’s priority is to sign a center back but with Jorginho and N’Golo Kante coming towards the twilight of their careers, De Jong is a very similar player and would slot in very nicely to safeguard the future of Chelsea’s midfield. (JPW)\nCallum Hudson-Odoi believes the writing is on the wall regarding his Chelsea career: If he has not yet convinced Thomas Tuchel he should be a more important figure in the team, he is not likely to ever do so, therefore a move away is required. Fortunately for the 21-year-old, he won’t be without plenty of options. According to a report from the Guardian, Southampton are interested in a loan move, while Leicester and Borussia Dortmund are keen to sign Hudson-Odoi permanently. Dortmund previously sought a loan for Hudson-Odoi last summer. Chelsea previously rejected bids of more than $25 million from Bayern Munich prior to Tuchel’s arrival at the club. (AE)\nNow, this is getting out of hand, isn’t it? Wesley Fofana, 21, is a very good center back and is a star of the future. But according to the Guardian, Chelsea are willing to pay a world-record $102 million to sign Fofana. That would be a world-record fee for a defender. It would surpass what Manchester United paid for Harry Maguire and what Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk. There is, of course, a Premier League premium on this deal and Leicester City also say they don’t need to sell Fofana. They probably don’t but if Fofana is open to the move, which reports suggest he is, then the Foxes should probably snap up this fee as they h ave Jonny Evans, Jannik Vestergaard and Caglar Soyuncu around at center back and can use the money to significantly improve their squad (which they need to do after not signing a single player this summer).\nWhen it comes to Chelsea, are they overpaying for players this summer? Marc Cucurella, Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly have all arrived for huge transfer fees and it seems like Chelsea’s new owners are paying somewhat of a premium because they are, well, Chelsea’s new owners. Todd Boehly is getting a lot of stick for paying over the odds and only time will tell if Cucurella, Fofana and Co. are worth these huge transfer fees. The focus at Chelsea will likely now be on selling players and they will have to move on a lot of fringe players to offset this huge spending spree. (JPW)\nChelsea are willing to go to £85m for Fofana and believe that would be enough to get him. Would take their spending over £200m and could be more beyond that (FDJ, Casadei, Auba targeted). So are they going to be able to make anything back on sales? #cfc\n— Jacob Steinberg (@JacobSteinberg) August 6, 2022\n\nChelsea remain undeterred in their pursuit of Leicester center back Wesley Fofana, who is now the subject of an $84.5-million bid by the Blues, according to a report. Brendan Rodgers has insisted the 21-year-old is not for sale, but new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly is expected to return with an even bigger bid if the latest offer is rejected. Interesting negotiating strategy, that, but it’ll likely result in Chelsea getting what they want in the end. (AE)\nChelsea\'s latest bid for Wesley Fofana is over £70m and won\'t be the last one made if rejected. Brendan Rodgers again said Fofana isn\'t for sale, but Todd Boehly means business. Fofana is Chelsea\'s number one target between now and when window shuts.\n— Ben Jacobs (@JacobsBen) August 5, 2022\n\nOne of the biggest shock signings of the summer has been completed, with Spanish left back Marc Cucurella signing for Chelsea from Brighton for a reported $75 million fee ($66 million up front, with $9 million in add ons). Cucurella, 24, looked set to join Manchester City for most of the summer but the reigning PL champs baulked at the price Brighton wanted for him. So in stepped Chelsea. They have also sent promising young defender Levi Colwill to Brighton on loan as part of the deal.\nAs for Cucurella, his rise has been meteoric. He had a phenomenal season at Brighton in 2021-22 after arriving from Getafe last summer and he is a superb attacking left back who will perfectly slot into Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 as a left wing-back. Marcos Alonso is expected to move to Barcelona after this deal was confirmed and Cucurella and Ben Chilwell will battle it out for the starting spot at Chelsea. There’s a lot of talk about Chelsea overpaying for Cucurella, especially when they already have Chilwell, and there’s logic in that. He is a quality player, though, and Chelsea now need to sign a couple of center backs and probably another striker and this will have been a very good window for them. (JPW)\nA message from Marc! 👋 #CucurellaIsChelsea pic.twitter.com/Gm2l7WF5Q7\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) August 5, 2022\n\nLongtime Chelsea leader and captain Cesar “Dave” Azpilicueta is not going back to Spain after all.\nThe Osasuna academy graduate who then went to Marseille before moving to the Premier League was expected to sign for Barcelona but things have been drawn out when it comes to Barca opening up room for wages.\nIt’ll be a two-year contract for Azpilicueta according to several reports but Chelsea has not yet announced the move. It does feel right that the 32-year-old defender remain at Stamford Bridge deeper into his career, if not to the finish line.\nMeanwhile, Football.London says that Brighton manager Graham Potter has removed Marc Cucurella from first-team training amid reports of a fee agreement with Chelsea.\nNow that agreement has been denied by Brighton, but it does make it seem like Cucurella is moving closer to getting his transfer request. Keep an eye on this space. (NM)\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, Chelsea are considering a move for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The 33-year-old joined Barcelona in January but given the financial restrictions at Barca, plus the fact that they continue to sign new players, it appears that the Catalan club are offering up the Gabonese superstar. Why? Well, it is all about money. Per the report, Aubameyang’s wages will rise next year and Barcelona want to avoid paying that.\nWould Aubameyang be a good fit for Chelsea? He would fit their system and we know he’s a great finisher. Aubameyang could also add plenty of experience to a very youthful attack and if he’s happy and teams are playing to his strengths. Thomas Tuchel will be wary of Aubameyang potential throwing his toys out of the pram like he did at Arsenal but the player and coach know each other extremely well from their time together at Borussia Dortmund, which was hugely successful for Auba.\nWith Kalidou Koulibaly coming in at center back, Chelsea have proved they are willing to sign winners, leaders and experienced stars to balance their largely youthful squad. Aubameyang fits the bill but the jury may be out as to whether he can fit into their fluid 3-4-2-1 system as the lone forward. (JPW)\nIt’s official: one of the top midfield prospects in the game has joined Chelsea from Aston Villa. Carney Chukwuemeka, 18, left Villa with less than a year left on his contract and Chelsea have pounced to sign the central midfielder. Chukwuemeka is expected to go straight into Thomas Tuchel’s first team squad and once again Chelsea are putting faith in youth. (JPW)\nBlue suits you, @Chukwuemekaa10! 😍\nRead all about it! ⤵️#ChukwuemekaIsChelsea\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) August 4, 2022\n\nMarc Cucurella’s transfer from Brighton to Chelsea is nearing completion after all involved parties agreed terms with one another on Wednesday. According to Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea will pay $60.7 million to Brighton, who will also receive a top prospect, 19-year-old defender Levi Colwill, in the exchange. Colwill was a standout performer for nearly-promoted Championship side Huddersfield Town last season, as he appeared in 29 league games as a teenager. Manchester City, who previously made a run at signing the 24-year-old Cucurella, weren’t willing to go up to $60 million in their negotiations, let alone with a first team-ready prospect also included.

Rather than lose him for nothing in next summer, Steven Gerrard’s Villans have sold Chukwuemeka to the Blues for a reported $24 million. Not a bad return. (NM)\nMarc Cucurella’s move to Manchester City appears to have collapsed as the reigning Premier League champs won’t up their offer. But that doesn’t mean the Spanish left back won’t be playing in the Champions League this season… A report from the Daily Mail says that Chelsea are ready to sign Cucurella and will offer cash plus promising center back Levi Colwill. Other reports have since stated that talks between Chelsea and Brighton are advanced. With Chelsea set to let Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta move on this summer, they need defensive reinforcements and this could be a good deal for all involved. Cucurella has told Brighton he wants to move but Man City aren’t willing to pay what Brighton want for him (close to $60 million) so it appeared he would not get his dream move and would stay at Brighton and be unhappy. However, this could be a very good compromise. (JPW)\nChelsea are pushing to hijack Marc Cucurella deal!

First call @CraigHope_DM pic.twitter.com/Md7hJpAFkU\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) August 1, 2022\n\nA report from Sport in Spain says that Chelsea are pushing hard to sign Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona. Per the report, Chelsea will also sell Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso to Barcelona and then spend $82 million on the Dutch midfielder. De Jong, 25, has been linked with a move to Manchester United all summer long but doesn’t appear to be keen on playing for a team not in the UEFA Champions League. Chelsea are of course in the Champions League and with N’Golo Kante and Jorginho coming towards the end of their careers, Thomas Tuchel needs to look to the future. The report also says Barca will make a move for Bernardo Silva if they sell De Jong, as the Catalan club have spoken glowingly about the Man City and Portugal star over the last few months.\nAs for De Jong, his sublime control on the ball and positioning would be pretty perfect for Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 system. He and Mateo Kovacic could hold things down together for the next five years. Now, the main issue is whether or not De Jong wants to leave Barcelona. Up to now he’s said he’s very happy at Barca but club president Joan Laporta and his manager Xavi continue to put pressure on him. Both keep saying they don’t want to sell him but they also mention the ‘economic situation’ as reports suggest Frenkie de Jong is being asked to take a wage cut, even though he is reportedly owed close to $20 million in wage deferrals from 2020. If Chelsea pip Manchester United to signing Frenkie de Jong then Erik ten Hag will not be a happy man as he will lose out on the player he wants to build his midfield around, while a top four rival will also be strengthened. (JPW)\nChelsea’s interest in Leicester City center back Wesley Fofana was first reported this week, and the Blues have reportedly decided to press forward in their pursuit of the 21-year-old Frenchman (not yet capped at senior level for France). A deal won’t come cheap for Chelsea, though, as David Ornstein reported on Sunday that Leicester value Fofana at $100 million, give or take a few million either way. Fofana burst onto the Premier League scene as a 19-year-old in his first season with the Foxes before suffering a broken leg on the eve of the 2021-22 season, keeping him out of action from August to mid-March.\nInter Milan right back Denzel Dumfries is another name reportedly high atop Thomas Tuchel’s shopping list, with captain Cesar Azpilicueta set to turn 33 later this month and frequently linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old Dutch international (35 caps) joined Inter last summer and won the Coppa Italia in his first season at the San Siro. (AE)\nOur partners in the UK at Sky Sports are reporting that Chelsea are interested in Leicester City center back Wesley Fofana. The French defender, 21, missed most of last season after breaking his leg in preseason but is highly-regarded as one of the top young defenders in Europe under the age of 22. Fofana only recently signed a new two-year contract extension at Leicester and it would take a pretty massive offer to sign him. Chelsea are desperate for central defenders, though, as Kalidou Koulibaly has arrived this summer but they lost Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger on free transfers to Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively.\nWith the future of Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso still up in the air amid interest from Barcelona, plus long-term target Jules Kounde looking likely to sign for Barcelona instead of Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel has cut a frustrated figure in recent weeks, especially after their 4-0 friendly defeat to Arsenal. He wants his squad to be settled heading into the opening weekend of the new season but that seems very unlikely. Fofana would be a good signing for Chelsea. His quality is clear for all to see and he would slot in well to the 3-4-2-1 system and is very comfortable on the ball and coming out of the back to start attacks. Leicester would ask for a huge transfer fee for him as they know Chelsea are getting pretty desperate, but the fee could be one worth paying as Chelsea are running out of time, and options. (JPW)\nThomas Tuchel isn’t happy with the amount of players Chelsea have been able to sign this summer and now that it appears that Jules Kounde will be heading to Barcelona instead of Stamford Bridge, the race to sign defenders is well and truly on. A report from 90min says that Pau Torres, Josko Gvardiol and Milan Skriniar are three center back options Chelsea are looking at closely, while Bayern Munich duo Dayot Upamecano and Benjamin Pavard could also be options. Torres and Pavard seem the most likely signings for Chelsea from that lengthy list of defenders as Tuchel needs reinforcements in defense for Chelsea to have any chance of mounting a serious title challenge this season. Right now, Chelsea will line up with Thiago Silva, Kalidou Koulibaly and probably Cesar Azpilicueta at center back for the opening day of the season in their 3-4-2-1 formation. However, Azpilicueta could leave for Barcelona but if the Catalan club sign Jules Kounde ahead of Chelsea that could actually scupper Azpilicueta’s move to Barcelona.\nIf Azpilicueta does move on then Denzel Dumfries will likely arrive at right wing-back, with the Dutch international said to be Chelsea’s main target for that position according to the London Evening Standard. The Inter Milan defender, 26, could play as the right wing-back in the 3-4-2-1 formation and Reece James could switch to be the right-sided center back for Chelsea. That could solve their center back issue, at least in the short-term, as Chelsea will likely bring in a new central defender (or two) before the transfer window shuts on September 1. Things are getting very interesting for Tuchel and the new Chelsea owners as deals need to be completed fast if they’re going to seriously compete for trophies this season. (JPW)\nFabrizio Romano has indicated that Timo Werner could leave Chelsea this summer, with Juventus and RB Leipzig linked with a move for the German international. Werner’s comments during preseason upset Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, as the striker revealed he could be happy at whatever club he was playing at. After struggling for goals, and minutes, during the 2021-22 campaign, Werner’s playing time could be reduced further this season after the arrival of Raheem Sterling. Werner, 26, is loved by Chelsea fans for his work rate but he has scored just 10 goals in 56 Premier League games over the last two seasons and 23 goals in 89 appearances in all competitions. He has been guilty of snatching at big chances and not being clinical enough in front of goal.\nAnother report from Bild in Germany states that Newcastle want to sign Werner. Heading to Newcastle or back to Leipzig seems like a very good move for Werner, with the former probably his best bet. In the right system he will cause havoc but Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 formation just doesn’t suit his style of play and he is much better in a team that plays two up front or a traditional 4-3-3 where wide players are forwards. Werner wants to lock in his spot in Germany’s World Cup roster and playing regularly has to be his aim between now and November. He isn’t going to get that at Chelsea as Sterling, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech all appear to be ahead of him in the pecking order for the three attacking roles. (JPW)\nTimo Werner could really leave Chelsea this summer.

Koulibaly, 31, is exactly the kind of center back Chelsea needed to rebuild their defense and Tuchel has added real quality in Koulibaly and Sterling. Who’s next? Probably another few defenders with Presnel Kimpembe and Jules Kounde targeted. Koulibaly is perfect for the 3-4-2-1 formation and will replace Antonio Rudiger as the commanding force in the Chelsea defense who will step out and be aggressive. Koulibaly and Thiago Silva have plenty of experience and it will be intriguing to see who Thomas Tuchel lines up alongside them this season.

It seems like this deal for 18-year-old USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina has dragged on and on, but there is no real rush on either side as Slonina will be heading back to the Chicago Fire on loan. As we’ve said below, Slonina will eventually head to Chelsea over the next year or so and his next step is to head out on loan in Europe. The American goalkeeper has a very bright future and this is a good move for him to enter the European market and have a huge club like Chelsea handling his development.

The center back, 27, was linked with a move back to Chelsea but that won’t happen and according to reports, the Blues aren’t delighted about the move stalling late on. With Presnel Kimpembe potentially on his way to partner Kalidou Koulibaly, Chelsea should have plenty of options at center back but probably need one more signing to back-up Thiago Silva and Cesar Azpilicueta (if he stays) as youngster Levi Colwill will also be on the move.

Sterling will be the main man in attack for Thomas Tuchel and will give him them the clinical edge and pace they need in attack. This is a massive upgrade for Chelsea and proves the ambition of their new owners, as Sterilng will excel in the 3-4-2-1 formation in one of the underneath roles, or even up top as the central striker. (JPW)\nHe\'s here! 😁#SterlingIsChelsea\n— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) July 13, 2022\n\nA report from the Daily Mail claims that Chelsea have turned their attention to Serge Gnabry after Raphinha appears to be heading to Barcelona. Gnabry, 26, is valued at $53 million by Bayern Munich and the Germany international has just one year left on his contract, with Chelsea reaching out to Bayern about his availability. The silky winger creates and scores goals galore and with Chelsea set to add Raheem Sterling and chasing other forward options, it is clear Thomas Tuchel wants to freshen up his attack. Romelu Lukaku has been loaned out to Inter Milan, Hakim Ziyech could be leaving for AC Milan, while the likes of Christian Pulisic and Timo Werner have also been linked with moves away.\nWould Gnabry slot in well at Chelsea? Everything suggests so. He is versatile, clinical in the final third and along with Sterling would give Chelsea’s attacking unit a totally different look. Tuchel prefers to play without a target forward and Sterling and Gnabry could start underneath Havertz, or one of them could even start up top with Mason Mount in the attacking midfield position. Gnabry would give Tuchel flexibility and the German coach loves that from his team. Gnabry doesn’t appear to be closer to agreeing a new contract at Bayern Munich and Chelsea could take advantage of that situation. (JPW)\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, Napoli and Senegal center back Kalidou Koulibaly remains on Chelsea’s wish list as they aim to sign new center back. Negotiations for Nathan Ake are continuing too, as Thomas Tuchel looks to rebuild his defense. Matthijs de Ligt seems to be heading to Bayern Munich from Juventus, so Chelsea have given up pursuing the Dutch center back. Koulibaly has a huge contract offer on the table from Napoli but per the report, talks with his agent have continued and he is seen as a key man for the Blues.\nDavid Ornstein is now reporting that Chelsea are even closer to signing Koulibaly for a deal worth over $40 million.\n🚨 Chelsea close to agreements on fee + personal terms to sign Kalidou Koulibaly.

In a word, huge. After losing Antonio Rudiger to Real Madrid and Andreas Christensen to Barcelona on free transfers, captain Cesar Azpilicueta could also be heading to Barca and that leaves Chelsea very short in defense. Ake and Koulibaly would be perfect fits for Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 system and Koulibaly would be a very good direct replacement for Antonio Rudiger. Koulibaly will be expensive but he does have just one year left on his contract at Napoli and the 31-year-old may feel like now is the time to take his talents to the Premier League after what seems like constant links in every single transfer window of the last five years. (JPW)\nJust when it looked like USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina, 18, would not be heading to Chelsea, it appears the deal is back on. According to Fabrizio Romano, a deal for Slonina is back in the works as Todd Boehly is dealing with it personally. The American goalkeeper is regarded as one of the top young prospects in the world and Real Madrid were said to be pushing Chelsea to sign him. Per the report, Slonina will stay at Chicago Fire on loan and the deal will be worth over $10 million plus add ons. It appears that Slonina will be one for the future for Chelsea as Edouard Mendy will be their goalkeeper for many years to come. That said, Slonina could come in as the No. 2 in the next few years and gain valuable experience, plus this move opens up the opportunity to head elsewhere in Europe on loan. (JPW)\nChelsea have reached verbal agreement with Chicago Fire for Gabriel Slonina, after direct talks between Todd Boehly and MLS club. 10m deal plus add-ons, he\'d stay at Chicago on loan. 🔵🇺🇸 #CFC\nChelsea are expected to submit official bid this week in order to get the deal done. pic.twitter.com/965dJHuI6w\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) July 11, 2022\n\nThis really has become a saga but it appears that Raphinha’s move to Barcelona is closer to completion. Fabrizio Romano has said that Leeds have finally accepted a bid from Barca and now the only wait is until the Catalan club can afford to register Raphinha and complete the deal. Raphinha, 25, was wanted by a host of Premier League clubs and it looked like he would join Chelsea after they had a bid accepted. However, his dream has always been to play for Barcelona and the Brazil international looks to have got his move with Chelsea now moving for Raheem Sterling and perhaps another wide forward (see above). As for Raphinha, he will play a key role at Barcelona who are likely to move on plenty of other players this summer as Xavi freshens up his squad. It is quite likely that Raphinha, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres will be Barcelona’s main men in attack. (JPW)\nNow, N’Golo Kante is still probably in the top three defensive midfielders in the world when he’s fully fit, so why would Chelsea sell him? Kante, 31, has just one year left on his contract at Chelsea and it appears he may be ready for a new challenge. With that in mind, the Daily Star claims that Manchester United want to rival Arsenal to sign Kante this summer. Kante is currently in the UK and not on Chelsea’s preseason tour of the U.S. due to his vaccination status not allowing him to enter the United States of America.\nShould Chelsea cash in on Kante now? They will likely get close to $50 million for him if they sold him this summer and the French international struggled increasingly with injuries last season. When he’s fit and firing on all cylinders there are still few defensive midfielders better than him in the world but it seems like Thomas Tuchel wants to freshen up his midfield options with Jorginho also coming towards the end of his contract at Stamford Bridge and plenty of replacements, such as Matheus Nunes and Frenkie de Jong, have been linked with Chelsea in recent weeks. (JPW)\nRaheem Sterling has agreed to join Chelsea after seven seasons at Manchester City, according to multiple reports.\nThe 27-year-old England star would move with the World Cup coming up, and the move could alter the club futures for fellow international stars Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, and Hakim Ziyech.\nWhat would this transfer mean for Chelsea? More details and analysis, here. (NM)\nAccording to a report from A Bola in Portugal, Chelsea are set to bid for Sporting Lisbon midfielder Matheus Nunes. Per the report, Chelsea will bid over $45 million to sign the silky, two-way central midfielder. Could that mean the likes of Jorginho (who was linked with Juventus) may leave Chelsea this summer? Thomas Tuchel and new chairman Todd Boehly — who is also acting as a temporary head of recruitment — are trying to make plenty of moves as they are chasing Nathan Ake, Jules Kounde and Matthijs de Ligt to strengthen their defense, plus chasing deals for Raheem Sterling, Raphinha and Cristiano Ronaldo. Apparently the idea of Nunes heading to Chelsea came up with Jorge Mendes (also Ronaldo’s agent) met with Boehly recently.\nWhat type of player is Nunes? He’s a creative box-to-box midfielder who loves to dictate the tempo of the game and the 23-year-old is regarded as one of the top young midfielders in the game. Is this an area of the pitch Chelsea need to strengthen? Potentially. Jorginho is getting towards the end of his career, Kante was injury prone last season and Mateo Kovacic also had injury issues. Nunes seems to be exactly the kind of midfielder Tuchel likes in his 3-4-2-1 system as he gets on the ball, drives forward, keeps it well and is precise with his passing. (JPW)\nBenjamin Pavard is reportedly a target for Chelsea, according to the Daily Mirror. And our partners at Sky in Germany believe that the 26-year-old could move on from Bayern Munich this summer after the reigning German champs signed Noussair Mazaroui from Ajax. Per the report Chelsea believe that their main defensive target, Matthijs de Ligt, could be heading to Bayern instead so they are lining up alternatives. As for Pavard, he is a right back primarily but is very comfortable playing anywhere in defense and the French international has an eye for goal and can deliver real quality on the ball going forward.\nPavard is exactly the kind of player who would slot into Thomas Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 formation seamlessly and this feels like a long-term replacement for Cesar Azpilicueta. Chelsea have been linked with plenty of players in recent weeks as the new ownership have finally arrived at the club and chairman Todd Boehly is trying to get plenty of deals done before the Blues head on their tour of the U.S. this summer. Pavard would be perfect and with Nathan Ake, Prisnel Kimpembe and Jules Kounde all linked with a move to Chelsea, defensive reinforcements are right at the top of Tuchel’s wish-list after Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger moved on this summer. (JPW)\nIt seems like Gabriel Slonina, 18, will not be heading to Chelsea. According to the London Evening Standard, a deal for Slonina to head to Stamford Bridge has been halted. Real Madrid and Wolves have also been linked with a move for the Chicago Fire product, who was close to joining Chelsea in January before sanctions were placed on the club and several key individuals on the recruitment side have since left. Slonina is highly-rated and has already been in the full USMNT squad as he continues to shine in MLS week after week. His future definitely lies in Europe but it seems like he won’t be signing for Chelsea. (JPW)\nA report from The Athletic claims that Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly has been in talks with Jorge Mendes about a potential deal for Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, 37, has reportedly told United he wants to move on this summer and he did not turn up for the first day of preseason due to ‘family reasons’ as it appears his second spell at Old Trafford is coming to an abrupt end. Per this report, Chelsea are exploring if they could do a deal for Ronaldo but there are apparently some hestitations from Thomas Tuchel about Ronaldo being a good fit for the Blues.\nWould this work? Firstly, it would be shocking if Man United sold Ronaldo to a direct top four rival in the Premier League. Why would they do that? Ronaldo is under contract for another season so they would rather keep him against his will for one season rather than strengthen a rival. Secondly, it’s quite clear that Ronaldo would score plenty of goals at Chelsea but would his arrival upset the balance of the squad as it did at United? The second point is wading into muddy waters as Chelsea have had success in bringing in a superstar veteran (Thiago Silva) and if Ronaldo is willing to work with their talented youngsters, he will get plenty of chances to score. Chelsea need a new No. 9 after loaning out Romelu Lukaku and Ronaldo wants to play in the Champions League, which Chelsea are in. On the face of it, this makes sense for everyone aside from Manchester United. That is the big problem. (JPW)\nOur partners in the UK at Sky Sports have heard contrasting reports when it comes to Raheem Sterling to Chelsea. One source said a fee is close to being agreed, while another played that down. What we do know is that Thomas Tuchel wants to sign Sterling, 27, and now is probably a good time for him to move on from Man City. Sterling has one year left on his contract at City and Pep Guardiola rotated him in and out of the team more than he would have liked last season. Sterling would be a big upgrade on Chelsea’s current attacking options and Tuchel wants to inject more pace and incisiveness into his attack. Sterling would provide that and even if many believe he should have scored more goals for City, he has still banged in 131 goals in 339 appearances over the last seven seasons and has been ridiculously consistent. (JPW)\nChristian Pulisic has a big summer ahead of him as the USMNT star will be thinking long and hard about his future at club level. Should he stay at Chelsea? Should he leave? Where should he go? The latest report on his situation is from\xa0The Daily Mail, as they say Christian Pulisic wants to stay at Chelsea despite interest in him from Juventus. Per the report, Pulisic is not keen on a move to Juve.\nThis follows a report on his future from\xa0The Daily Telegraph, as they said that Chelsea have offered Juventus one of Pulisic and Timo Werner, plus cash, for Matthijs de Ligt. Of course, USMNT fans will be hoping whatever happens with Christian Pulisic at Chelsea will be best for the U.S. ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. This is a very tough decision for Pulisic as he could stay at Chelsea but move behind Raheem Sterling, and other potential new signings, in the pecking order. Or he could head somewhere else and it may take him time to settle in too. It really is a 50/50 decision for the American star and it also depends heavily on whether or not Thomas Tuchel plans on giving him a big role this season. (JPW)\nOnce a Chelsea prospect, Dutch defender Nathan Ake is wanted by Thomas Tuchel for the first team at Stamford Bridge.\nThe 27-year-old ex-Bournemouth star has not played as much as he’d like at Manchester City but the Premier League champions rate him much higher than the proposed Chelsea bid.\nThe Blues are said to be willing to offer around $36 million, about half of the reported City valuation. What fee would it take to get City to sell a player to a would-be title rival. If Gabriel Jesus moved to London for $55 million, albeit with less time on his deal, perhaps that’s nearer to the bullseye. (NM)\nFULL STORY\nRomelu Lukaku to Inter Milan confirmed: Lukaku’s second spell at Chelsea came to another unceremonious end on Wednesday, when Inter Milan re-signed the Belgian striker on a season-long loan.\nThis time around, Lukaku scored 15 goals in 44 appearances (all competitions – 8 in 26 in the Premier League), bringing his Chelsea career total to 15 goals. In total, Chelsea have paid roughly $155 million for Lukaku. Quick math says, $10 million per goal. (AE)\nThe Todd Boehly revolution is well underway at Stamford Bridge, where Brazilian attacker Raphinha is set to arrive from Leeds United.\nIt’s a deal that could reach $80 million, according to Fabrizio Romano, and certainly loads up Jesse Marsch’s transfer kitty at Leeds.\nThis, of course, assumes that Chelsea can come to an agreement on a contract with Raphinha, who has also been linked with Barcelona and Arsenal.\nRaphinha scored 11 times with three assists for Leeds last Premier League season, a year after scoring six times and adding nine assists following a transfer from Stade Rennais.\nWhat a move this would be for a Chelsea team already loaded with attackers, just the latest sign that no one besides (probably) Kai Havertz and Mason Mount are safe in their status with Thomas Tuchel’s Blues. Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic, and others all could move by the end of the window.\nAll that said… you still need center backs to contend for a league, too. It’s not even July 1, though, so this transfer season may just be warming up. (NM)\nIs there a winger Chelsea don’t want to sign this summer!? After being linked with moves for Raheem Sterling and Ousmane Dembele in recent days and weeks, our partners in the UK at Sky Sports are now stating that Chelsea want to rival Tottenham to try and sign Richarlison. The 25-year-old Brazilian is a man in demand and has apparently told Frank Lampard he wants to leave Everton this summer and wants to play in the Champions League. With Chelsea letting Romelu Lukaku leave on loan, plus the likes of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic all likely to move on this summer, it appears that Thomas Tuchel is seriously freshening up his attack as Chelsea’s new owners try to make a splash.\nWould Richarlison to Chelsea make sense? Actually, yes, it would. A lot of sense. Richarlison is a mobile forward who can plan centrally in Chelsea’s 3-4-2-1 formation but he can also play as one of the underneath forwards. If Chelsea signed Richarlison, Sterling and Dembele this summer, then that would be a huge upgrade on their current attacking options and all three players would suit Tuchel very well. Richarlison would probably cost upwards of $65 million, with Sterling slightly less expensive and Dembele is available on a free. If Chelsea move on Ziyech, Werner and Pulisic for decent fees, or even decent loan fees, then this could work out very well. Defensively they still need a couple of new center backs but new chairman Todd Boehly is certainly busy early on at Chelsea as Petr Cech and Marina Granovskaia are both out and he’s taking a leading role in lining up these transfers, at least on an interim basis to start with. (JPW)\nA report from The Telegraph states that Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has reached out directly to Raheem Sterling to discuss a possible move to Stamford Bridge this summer. The England international, 27, could well be surplus to requirements at Manchester City next season and Chelsea need to freshen up their attack. With Romelu Lukaku on his way to Inter Milan, Hakim Ziyech in talks over a loan move to AC Milan and Timo Werner likely leaving too, it’s clear that Tuchel wants to rebalance his attack and Sterling is one of his top targets. Per the report, City value Sterling at $61-73 million and Chelsea will now make a bid after Tuchel spoke directly with the player.\nWould this be a good move for both Sterling and Chelsea? Probably. Sterling has been a star at Man City over the last seven seasons but he probably isn’t appreciated as much as he should be and with Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez arriving this summer at City, the speedy winger will face even stiffer competition for a starting spot. He struggled for minutes a little last season (2127 compared to 2537 in 2020-21) but his quality is clear for all to see. The way he stretches teams on the break and cuts inside would suit Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 system well, as Sterling could play as the central striker or as one of the two underneath forwards. Sterling has just one year left on his current contract at City and with Gabriel Jesus set to leave this summer for Arsenal, are City going to allow both to move on? Maybe. They have always been pretty good at letting players move on if they want to but Pep Guardiola may feel a little shorthanded if both Sterling and Jesus leave this summer. (JPW)\nYes, this is actually a real thing. And yes, Manchester United have denied it could happen. However, there is clearly a bit of a theme rumbling behind-the-scenes here. In the past week there have been reports suggesting Ronaldo is unhappy with the lack of new signings at United, plus there have been reports linking him with a move to Roma, his former club Sporting Lisbon and now Chelsea are said to be interested in signing the Portuguese superstar. According to The Athletic, new Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly discussed the availability of Ronaldo, 37, when he met with ‘super-agent’ Jorge Mendes.\nPer the report, Ronaldo was discussed and Chelsea are interested in seeing whether or not he can be temped to west London. Given that he only has one year left on his contract and they’d be strengthening a direct top four rival, United would surely rather keep Ronaldo than sell him to Chelsea this summer. United have since briefed plenty of outlets, including our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, that Ronaldo is not for sale and will not leave this summer.\nBut would having an unhappy Ronaldo around be a huge problem for Erik ten Hag? Probably. His love for United is undoubted but it is easier to see why he’s so frustrated. Many believe he will not fit into the tactics deployed by ETH but the Dutch coach is said to believe he can. Let’s see how this goes but it seems like Ronaldo’s future is unexpectedly going to be the topic of much discussion this summer.\xa0(JPW)\nA report from our partners at Sky Italy states that Hakim Ziyech could head on loan to AC Milan in a similar deal which will see Romelu Lukaku move to Inter from Chelsea. Per the report, Ziyech is keen on the move and he has been a target for AC Milan for some time. The Moroccan winger has never really settled at Chelsea despite the odd sublime goal and stunning display. With Tuchel looking to freshen up his attack this summer, Ziyech, Werner, Lukaku and even Christian Pulisic appear to be surplus to requirements as Tuchel expects plenty of new arrivals under the new ownership group led by Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly. According to a separate report from The Telegraph the Blues boss expects up to six new players to arrive at Stamford Bridge this summer. With De Ligt, Raheem Sterling, Richarlison and Ousmane Dembele strongly linked with a move to Chelsea, this is going to be a very different looking side, especially in attack. (JPW)\nA report from Di Marzio in Italy suggests that Timo Werner plus $35 million is the offer Chelsea have put forward for Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt but the Turin club want Werner and closer to $45 million. Per the report both Werner and De Ligt are up for the move, with the Dutch center back set to be the new center-piece of Thomas Tuchel’s defense, while Werner is keen for a fresh start in Italy as his goalscoring woes in the Premier League continue. Would this be a good move for all parties? De Ligt has been much better in recent seasons at Juve but he has struggled at times and perhaps the Premier League would suit his game slightly better. As for Werner, well, he’s beloved by the Chelsea fans for his incredible effort in games but his finishing has really let him down and if he moves on now he can leave with his head held high. (JPW)\nJuventus center back Matthijs de Ligt’s $126 million release clause and its expectation not to budge much from the price tag may not stop Chelsea, according to Sky Sports.\nThe Blues are pursuing the 22-year-old Dutch star, having lost Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen this summer. Chelsea has to address the crew of Thiago Silva, Malang Sarr, and Trevoh Chalobah.\nDe Ligt cost Juventus about $79 million from Ajax. Amongst defenders, only Virgil van Dijk, Harry Maguire, and Lucas Hernandez have cost more than De Ligt’s transfer fee then and only four players have cost more than his current release clause, which expires in 2024.\nShould it happen, this would be huge splash from new chairman Todd Boehly? (NM).\nIt appears that Richarlison is a man in demand this summer as The Daily Mail reports that Chelsea are set to battle with Tottenham and Arsenal for his signature. The 25-year-old looks likely to leave Everton and it is believed that Thomas Tuchel is a big fan of the Brazilian international. With Romelu Lukaku on his way out, plus doubts over whether or not Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner will stick around, Chelsea are set to freshen up their attacking options. They’ve already been linked with moves for Raheem Sterling and Ousmane Dembele this summer and bringing in a wide forward who is comfortable cutting inside seems a priority.\nRicharlison can certainly do that and given his experience in the Premier League and his tenacity and work-rate, he seems like a very good fit for Tuchel’s 3-4-2-1 system at Chelsea as he could play up top or in one of the two underneath positions. The transfer fee is going to be sizeable (probably $60-70 million) but Richarlison has been consistent at Everton and there’s reason to believe he will create and score plenty of goals in a team who are on the front-foot more often. (JPW)\nAccording to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, West Ham are set to bid $37 million to sign young Chelsea and Albania striker Armando Broja. The 20-year-old had a very solid season on loan at Southampton last season as he scored nine goals in all competitions and showed plenty of promise despite playing in a team which struggled to create plenty of chances. Broja may be needed at Chelsea this season as they look set to sell Romelu Lukaku, but per the report the likes of Newcastle, Arsenal and Napoli also want to sign the powerful striker. West Ham seems like a very good fit for Broja as he would compete with Michail Antonio for minutes and the pair could be rotated as the Hammers have the Europa Conference League and Premier League to juggle. Broja is good on the counter, deceptively quick and is very aggressive and that suits West Ham’s style under David Moyes very well. (JPW)\nThe Blues are getting going in the transfer market and a report from our partners in the UK at Sky Sports states that Chelsea want to sign Raheem Sterling. Per the report, it would take a bid of over $73 million for City to let Sterling go this summer. The England forward, still just 27 years old, is out of contract next summer and it seems like he could be set for a move this summer.\nWould this be a good move for Chelsea, and Sterling? It seems like a pretty good fit and if Chelsea can drive down the price a little, they will go all-in for Sterling. That said, City could be selling to potential title rivals so they will want a big transfer fee.\nSterling is not really and out-and-out winger and Tuchel doesn’t like to play with pure wingers in his 3-4-2-1 system. He would be very good on the left of the two forwards underneath a central striker and he loves to cut inside and cause havoc. Even though Sterling gets a bad rep for missing big chances he has still scored 62 goals in all competitions for Man City over the last three seasons. That’s 20 goals per season and Chelsea need someone what that production in their forward line as Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech have all struggled to stay fit and in-form. With Erling Haaland arriving this summer at City, Sterling could well struggle for playing time this season at City and he has been in and out of the team over the last 12 months. He could play centrally at Chelsea, as the report suggests, and Tuchel is said to be a big fan of Sterling. Add in all of that to the fact that Sterling grew up in west London and his family connections are in the area and it all kind of makes sense, right? (JPW)\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, a potential deal for USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina, 18, is entering ‘important hours’ as Chelsea and Real Madrid are the frontrunners to sign him. The Chicago Fire goalkeeper has been a Chelsea target for many months and now they have their ownership situation figured out, they can start trying to sign players once again.\nShould Slonina sign for Real or Chelsea? He’s not going to play for either team regularly but it would allow him to develop next to some of the best goalkeepers in the world and also go out on loan in Europe to gain valuable experience. (JPW)\nImportant hours ahead for Gabriel Slonina transfer. Real Madrid made official bid turned down by Chicago Fire last week – but Chelsea are also in talks to sign him, after being really close last February 🚨🇺🇸 #CFC\nDecision to be made soon – gonna be one of MLS record transfers. pic.twitter.com/yrAYjITU6T\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 11, 2022\n\nAndreas Christensen, Charly Musonda, Danny Drinkwater and Jake Clarke-Salter have all left Chelsea as free agents. After Antonio Rudiger left as a free agent and signed for Real Madrid, this quartet were also expected to leave at the end of their deals. Chelsea had been keen to keep Danish center back Christensen around but he is expected to join Barcelona this summer.\nIf that move doesn’t happen due to Barca’s financial situation, Christensen will not be short of options. With the futures of Cesar Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso, Romelu Lukaku and several other forwards (see below) uncertain, it is building up to be a very intriguing summer at Chelsea. And, oh yeah, they also have new billionaire owners who are keen to make their mark. (JPW)\nThomas Tuchel is going to be remaking Chelsea’s defense this summer, but the attack may also see a shift In personnel as the Blues are reportedly willing to listen to offers for\xa0Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, and Christian Pulisic.\nOf course, one of those names will jump off the page on this site. Pulisic, 23, has made no secret of his desire to play and there are plenty of clubs who’d welcome the chance to give him that opportunity.\nPulisic and Werner are on the list of CIES’ top 100 transfer values in the world, and could fetch a pretty penny for a Chelsea club who may also be losing a third name on that list: Romelu Lukaku.\nWas he really underutilized last season, and is the same true for Werner? or Ziyech? Or Lukaku? We take a deeper dive here (NM).\nFollowing his failed return to Stamford Bridge this season, Romelu Lukaku is hoping to leave the club once again this summer. He wants to go back to Inter Milan, and Inter Milan would like to have him back, but there’s just one problem: Chelsea have already sunk roughly $155 million into the signing (transfer fee plus first season’s wages), thus they would like to be compensated (handsomely) in order to re-(un)-acquire the 29-year-old Belgian striker, even on loan. According to a report from the Guardian, the Blues could demand as much as $31 million for the initial loan fee, plus a significant chunk of Lukaku’s $21-million annual salary. (AE)\nPSV Eindhoven midfielder Ibrahim Sangare has been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea in reports that say the combative midfielder plans to be in the Premier League next season.\nSangare, 24, has a $44 million release clause and three years left on his PSV contract, having moved from then-Ligue 2 side Toulouse at the start of 2020-21 season.\nHe registered the third-most tackles in Eredivisie last season with 95 and the third-most interceptions with 74, chipping in three goals while passing the ball at nearly 87 percent. (NM)\nA report from Goal.com states that Chelsea are still interested in signing USMNT goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina. The 18-year-old is a starter for the Chicago Fire and recently turned down a call-up to the Poland national team to represent the USMNT. Real Madrid reportedly also want to sign Slonina, who is one of the top young goalkeeping prospects on the planet. Would this move be a good one for the young American? He’d almost certainly go out on loan and getting regular minutes is key as he wouldn’t be close to challenging Edouard Mendy for the starting spot. (JPW)\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, the Inter Milan board will meet with Lukaku’s reps today. He claims that Lukaku ‘dreams of a return’ to Inter but nothing has been discussed with Chelsea. Lukaku, 29, only joined Chelsea from Inter last summer for a huge $122.6 million fee. However, after a good start to the season his form dipped massively and he scored just eight Premier League goals in 16 starts. Chelsea’s attack was their main issue all season long and Tuchel wants to revamp it this summer as Lukaku, Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Christian Pulisic could all be on the move. It has been reported elsewhere that Lukaku could initially head back to Inter on loan. (JPW)\nInter board will meet Romelu Lukaku\'s laywer in the coming hours.

When this Newcastle side gets going and St James’ Park is fully behind them, there are few teams who can stop them.\nArsenal’s top four hopes unravelled at Newcastle at around this time last season and Arteta will be hoping his young side learned from that harsh lesson. They have still taken a huge, and unexpected, step forward this season as they’ve already qualified for the Champions League. But there is now a negative vibe around the Gunners as defensive mistakes have crept in all over the place over the last few weeks as their title bid has stalled.

"{'content': 'Arsenal transfer news: The January transfer window was interesting (and important) for the Gunners as Mikel Arteta’s side is clearly a big contender for everything the Premier League has to offer… but the summer might have even more interesting subplots.[\xa0VIDEO:\xa0Premier League analysis ]\xa0After finishing two points behind north London rivals Tottenham, due to back-to-back defeats on Matchweeks 36 and 37 with UEFA Champions League qualification nearly in the bag, Arsenal isn’t leaving anything up to chance this go-round as they vie for the Premier League title.The Gunners lead the Premier League and show no signs of slowing down; They’ve been locking down their key performers to new deals as UEFA Champions League life is fast approaching the Arsenal.Following the departures of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Barcelona, in January 2022) and Alexandre Lacazette (end of contract, this summer), Arteta continues to rejuvenate an already stunning attack that includes Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka, and captain Martin Odegaard.[ TRANSFER NEWS: Liverpool | Chelsea | Tottenham | Man City\xa0| Man United ]Below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on Arsenal transfer news as Joe Prince-Wright (JPW), Nicholas Mendola (NM) and Andy Edwards (AE) will guide you through a hectic next few months.\nLatest transfer news\n\n\n\n \n\n\n                                Manchester United transfer news, live!

Latest reports, rumors, updates                            \n\n\n\nArsenal archived transfer news today, live!April 18 – Declan Rice prefers move to Arsenal, not Newcastle, this summerWith just one year remaining on his current contract, Declan Rice is all but certain to leave West Ham this summer, as Arsenal and Newcastle are both 1) preparing to be in next season’s UEFA Champions League, and 2) very interested in the 24-year-old services.However, all signs point toward Rice and Arsenal arranging a deal sometime in the coming weeks and/or months. According to a report from talkSPORT, Rice prefers to make the short move from east London to north London, where the Mikel Arteta requires a defensive-minded midfielder around which to build the next team in his Arsenal project.West Ham will hope to get somewhere in the neighborhood of $125 million for Rice, but that could be a difficult sales pitch to Arsenal, who could simply wait 12 more months and sign him for free. (AE)April 9 – Gunners could vie with Tottenham for Ligue 1 hotshotMontpellier striker Elye Wahi’s 12 goals and three assists this season have Arsenal and Tottenham (as well as PSG) looking to woo the striker to North London this summer, according to French site\xa0Jeunes Footeux.Wahi turned 20 in January and he has a contract through the 2024-25 season so he won’t come cheap. The report says Montpellier’s asking for around $35 million.The center forward’s more than 6-feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday’s league match with Toulouse.The advanced stats say Wahi’s a raw scorer; He carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. Mikel Arteta already has a young English-American center forward coming back from loan in France and a few options already in North London but… maybe? (NM)April 1 – Aurelien Tchouameni targeted by Arsenal (again)Real Madrid splashed a lot of cash on Monaco star Aurelien Tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn’t starting opens him up for a sale, according to Catalan site El Nacional.Long-linked with Arsenal and Liverpool before moving to Real, Tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, and Manchester United.The 23-year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball.Carlo Ancelotti has found minutes for Tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means Real boss Florentino Perez is looking at an $80 million player who is often on the bench to start games. Could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (NM)March 20 – Arsenal wants Galatasaray fullbackMikel Arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to Turkey for a French youngster.Sacha Boey, 22, has been capped by France at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with Galatasaray.Boey has two goals in 23 appearances this year, having moved from Rennes in 2021. He previously racked up 30-plus Ligue 1 appearances between Rennes and Dijon.A report from Turkish site Aksam has Arsenal leading the race of Lyon, Sporting Lisbon, and Premier League clubs Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. (NM)February 27 – Gunners linked with Serie A star striker, midfielderMikel Arteta sees some things he likes in Italy, where World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez and Serbia star Sergej Milinkovic-Savic are reported as targets for the Arsenal.Martinez, 25, had been starring for Inter Milan long before he helped Lionel Messi win a World Cup, and the Argentine has 16 goals and seven assists across all competitions this season.TeamTalk says that Chelsea and Manchester United are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka.Calcio Mercato has the report on Milinkovic-Savic to Arsenal. Could the Lazio star finally make his move to the Premier League after being linked with an England transfer for ages?The 27-year-old has 39 caps and seven goals for Serbia, and he’s twice been Serie A Best XI, including last season. Milinkovic-Savic is Lazio’s two-time defending Player of the Year.Milinkovic-Savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. Newcastle and West Ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him European football. Advantage: Arsenal? (NM)February 25 – Arsenal eye Atalanta strikerCan never have enough finishers, can you?Arsenal is said to be joining Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Newcastle in pursuit of 20-year-old Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund.Twice-capped by Denmark, Hojlund started at home with Copenhagen before heading to Austria’s Sturm Graz.Hojlund has 13 goals and five assists in 29 appearances across all competitions between Sturm Graz and Atalanta, scoring against Dynamo Kiev in Champions League qualification for the latter.He’s one to watch, but it’s also worth noting that Atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for Champions League places in Serie A. He could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the UCL and UEL at a club that spotted him early. Heck, would a club like Arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to Italy? (NM)February 25 – Bukayo Saka, William Saliba approach new dealsReports out of North London say that Arsenal is nearing new deals with 21-year-olds: Center back William Saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker Bukayo Saka.Saka signed his current deal in 2019 and it runs through the end of the 2023-24 season: It’s safe to say his career has since found a new level.London-born and with 24 England caps, Saka is one of the faces of Arsenal’s renaissance. A relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in Premier League play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market.Easy decision for the Gunners, given his status within the team.

The price tag? About $15 million.Sure some Arsenal fans won’t love buying a player off of Chelsea, but Jorginho is one of the great game readers of his generation. The risk is low. (NM)January 29 – Brighton without Caicedo as talks continueA report from the Daily Mail says Arsenal have submitted a second bid for Moises Caicedo, with an improved offer of $86.6 million going in. Brighton are said to want $100 million for Caicedo. He did not play against Liverpool in the FA Cup on Sunday and reportedly he will not be around the team until Feb. 1, after the transfer deadline. Brighton have told Caicedo they want him to stay but his social media posting asking to be allowed to leave has put the writing on the wall. Will Arsenal up their offer and get their main ahead of Chelsea? (JPW)\nDe Zerbi: “Caicedo is a good guy. We will see.

Arsenal reportedly had a $65 million bid for Caicedo rejected as Brighton do not want to sell him in January. Fabrizio Romano has said that Arsenal will go in with an improved offer. Caicedo, 21, has been a revelation for the Seagulls and has been chased by Chelsea, and many other Premier League heavyweights, since the summer. This latest twist could force Brighton’s hand in the final hours of the January window but they are likely to want closer to $85 million for their talented box-to-box midfielder.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)January 26 – Huge offer for Caicedo on the way?It appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder. (JPW)January 25 – One back in (from La Liga), one out to FulhamReports say that Arsenal will led Cedric Soares head on loan to London neighbors Fulham, but not without a replacement.Sky Sports says that Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund are in hot pursuit of Real Valladolid right back Ivan Fresneda.Marca\xa0says that Fresneda missed Valladolid training amid reports that Arsenal matched BVB’s $15 million bid for the back.The 18-year-old has started regularly for Valladolid this season when healthy and has represented Spain at the U-18 and U-19 levels.Valladolid doesn’t have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to FBref.com. (NM)January 24 – Leeds join battle for McKennieAfter USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie was linked with a move to Arsenal, it appears that Leeds United are also keen on the American. According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week? That probably won’t be the case at Arsenal, at least initially. (JPW)\nLeeds are exploring new options for the midfield including Weston McKennie.

Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)January 23 – Declan Rice linked with Arsenal againOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)January 21 – Eduardo Camavinga loan talksThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)January 20 – Leandro Trossard confirmed as newest Arsenal signing\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023January 19 – Trossard talks intensifyIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved. (JPW)\nEXCLUSIVE: Arsenal have opened talks to sign Leandro Trossard from Brighton, negotiations are advanced with official bid ready for permanent move. 🚨⚪️🔴 #AFC\nPersonal terms already agreed — talks will continue to get deal done soon. pic.twitter.com/WgiCtz1jG1\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 19, 2023January 16 – Moussa Diaby a top target?Arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears Bayer Leverkusen’s Moussa Diaby is the latest target. According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)January 16 – Gunners in Declan Rice driver’s seat?The London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.The 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.Rice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)January 16 – Raphinha, Ferran Torres interestAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)January 15 – Gunners have interest in Leandro TrossardAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup. (JPW)January 15 – Mudryk signs in $108 million deal on eight-and-a-half year dealMykhailo Mudryk has signed for Chelsea, as the Blues reportedly offered him double what Arsenal were prepared to pay him in wages. Mudryk, 22, has signed an eight-and-a-half year deal and the Ukrainian winger will be a big part of their future as they continue to expensively revamp their squad.

(AE)January 10 – Mudryk travels with Shakhtar as talks continueThe latest reports on Mykhaylo Mudryk to Arsenal have arrived and although the Gunners seem to be encouraged that they can strike a deal, the Ukraine international winger has flown to Turkey and gone on tour with them. Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.That said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments. The structure of the deal seems to be being worked out and Arsenal really need to add another forward player so they can rotate their attacking lineup.

The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp. Per the report, the issues with his contract talks at Barca involve the financial restraints they are facing and that has caused issues trying to agree new long-term contracts with current players. Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation. Both Arsenal and Newcastle are looking to add players in a structured and sensible way and Balde’s quality, and age, tick all of their boxes in terms of their recruitment model.

Per a report from Jack Rosser of The Sun, Chelsea are ready to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international as Arsenal have yet to agree a transfer fee with Shakhtar Donetsk. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window but Chelsea certainly need some fresh attacking talent too and Shakhtar’s sporting director Darijo Srna is set to hold talks with the Blues this week.

Romano adds that if Arsenal and Shakhtar cannot agree a fee, Chelsea are waiting in the wings to snap up the extremely talented Ukraine international. Mudryk, 21, is Arsenal’s main target in the January window and given their recent recruitment success, it seems likely he will be another key part of Mikel Arteta’s jigsaw.

According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”Per our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)December 27 – Arsenal makes bid for Mykhailo MudrykReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.The Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.Some reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others. He’s scored 10 times with eight assists in 18 matches across all competitions this season.Mudryk is an electric dribbler who plays mainly on the left side, where fellow 21-year-old Gabriel Martinelli has often starred opposite another 21-year-old Bukayo Saka on the right. Relatively elderly Gabriel Jesus, 25, has been the Gunners center forward in front of 23-year-old Eddie Nketiah. The club also has Reiss Nelson and Marquinhos plus long-injured Emile Smith-Rowe.

Caicedo, 21, has been a revelation for the Seagulls and has been chased by Chelsea, and many other Premier League heavyweights, since the summer. This latest twist could force Brighton’s hand in the final hours of the January window but they are likely to want closer to $85 million for their talented box-to-box midfielder.

The 21-year-old has been one of the only bright spots in Everton’s dreadful campaign and the Belgian international is seen as a player Chelsea can sign this month to bolster their midfield and is easier (and much cheaper) to acquire than Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo. Onana arrived at Goodison from Lille last summer for a deal worth up to $40 million. It is believed Chelsea have offered $62 million initially for Onana, who can drive forward from midfield, is tidy on the ball and just always seems to make things happen. One problem: does Onana want to sign for Chelsea? A report from Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad states that Onana has rejected a move to Chelsea and wants to stay at Everton and keep them in the Premier League. There same report also says that a move to Arsenal could be a more realistic option for Onana. Are Arsenal and Chelsea settle to battle it out for yet another player? Keep a close eye on Onana late in this window. (JPW)\nIt appears that Arsenal and Chelsea are going to go head-to-head for plenty of new signings and Moises Caicedo is the latest star player at the center of the battle. A report from the London Evening Standard says that Arsenal could spend $93 million on Caicedo, 21, as Chelsea have baulked at Brighton’s asking price and look to have moved on to other targets. The Ecuadorian midfielder has been a revelation in the Premier League this season and is exactly the kind of player Arsenal have made a habit of recruiting over the last few years: young, hungry, physical and focused. Caicedo has been chased by Chelsea for months and most expected him to join his former Brighton boss Graham Potter at Stamford Bridge in the upcoming transfer windows. Wherever he goes, Caicedo will make Brighton a huge profit and looks set for a brilliant Premier League as a holding midfielder.

According to Fabrizio Romano, McKennie is an option Leeds are looking at. With Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson already at Elland Road, thanks largely to American coach Jesse Marsch, perhaps McKennie will head to Leeds where he will likely play every week?

Per the report, Arsenal are in talks with Juve and are willing to spend around $22-27 million on McKennie. The American midfielder could be part of the mass exodus at Juventus given the recent turmoil at the club, as the Italian giants were just handed a 15-point deduction amid ongoing investigations into finances and the governance of the club. The report says McKennie could be sell to fund the arrival of a new winger. McKennie has long been linked with Tottenham, and other PL clubs, but this move to Arsenal would suit his style of play very well and he would be a great midfielder to rotate in for Xhaka and Partey, while his versatility means he can slot in at right back, center back and elsewhere. (JPW)\nOkay, so Arsenal are definitely trying to sign a central midfielder. And it seems like Declan Rice is their top target for this summer. Rice’s contract at West Ham is ticking down and although Chelsea and Manchester United also wanted to sign the England international, a report from the Guardian says that Rice would prefer a move to Arsenal (JPW)\nThis is a real surprise, isn’t it? According to the London Evening Standard, Arsenal are in talks with Real Madrid over a loan move for Eduardo Camavinga. The 20-year-old France international has struggled to become a regular at Real and it appears he wants more regular action. Will he get that at Arsenal? It’s hard to see the duo of Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey being broken up but maybe Camavinga could play alongside them both in a more defensive midfield setup? Camavinga is a quality player and if Arsenal can get this loan move sealed, it significantly strengthens their options in central midfield.\xa0(JPW)\nNorth London\'s newest arrival. pic.twitter.com/utp1apPmmv\n— Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 20, 2023\n\nIt seems like Leandro Trossard is getting closer to joining Arsenal in January. Per Fabrizio Romano, the Brighton and Belgium star has agreed personal terms and is just waiting for the Gunners and Seagulls to agree a transfer fee. Trossard, 28, has fallen out with Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi and is out of their plans. It has been reported that Brighton want over $33 million for Trossard as he has just six months left on his current contract but Brighton can also trigger an extra year so he basically has 18 months left on his current deal. Would this be a good move for Arsenal? Absolutely, 1000 percent yes. Trossard can slot into several different roles in their wide, midfield and attacking areas and can also do a job at full back or wing-back. He is versatile, has quality on the ball and this season he has added plenty of goals to his name. Mikel Arteta needs extra depth in wide areas and Trossard provides that. It will be key to keeping Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli fresh. This is one of those situations where it is a great deal for all involved.

According to our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, Arsenal have reached out to Leverkusen about the availability of Diaby. The 23-year-old winger is a French international and Leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $108 million. Does that fee sound familiar? It is the transfer fee Chelsea just paid Shakhtar Donetsk for Mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in Europe. Diaby’s speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to Arsenal’s current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. He also creates and scores a lot of goals (25 assists and 23 goals since the start of the 2020-21 season), which is always handy. It seems like a move in the summer is more likely but Arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (JPW)\nThe London Evening Standard’s Nizaar Kinsella says that Arsenal has pulled ahead of Man City, Manchester United, and Chelsea in the race to sign West Ham star Declan Rice.\nThe 24-year-old England midfielder is part of the Irons’ potent midfield with Lucas Paqueta and Tomas Soucek, but has been said to want UEFA Champions League football and 15th-place West Ham is well off top-half standards so far this season.\nRice was long ticketed for old club Chelsea, but the Blues are said to prefer Enzo Fernandez and other options for the center of the park. (NM)\nAccording to 90min Arsenal have enquired about Barcelona duo Raphinha and Ferran Torres. Per the report, Arsenal’s sporting director Edu has held talks with Barca to see if the two wide forwards are available. After missing out on Mudryk, Arsenal still want to sign a new winger. It is believed both Raphinha and Torres could be available as Barcelona need to cut their wage bill further. Raphinha was a key target for Arsenal last summer but joined Barca from Leeds instead but the Brazilian winger has struggled to nail down a starting spot at the Nou Camp. If Arsenal could sign Raphinha for less than the $70 million Barcelona paid for him last summer, that would represent a very good deal for the Gunners. He knows the Premier League inside out and his style of play would suit this Arsenal side extremely well as he could rotate in and out of the lineup with Saka and Martinelli. (JPW)\nAccording to David Ornstein, Arsenal are now interested in signing Leandro Trossard from Brighton. After missing out on Mudryk, the Gunners still want to improve their options out wide and Trossard has six months left on his current deal at Brighton with the Seagulls having an option to extend his contract by a year. Trossard, 28, has been left out of Brighton’s recent squads and his agents released a statement saying his time at Brighton is basically up after falling out with manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard is proven in the Premier League and will be a very good option to rotate into Arsenal’s attacking lineup.

Shakhtar are currently on a midseason break and Mudryk, 22, has been on holiday and working with a personal trainer to keep himself sharp. He is now heading away with the team for training and friendly games, so a deal does not appear to be imminent.\nThat said, a report from the Daily Express suggests that Shakhtar are finally open to negotiating down their asking price of $100 million and some compromises are being found. This all hinges on how much Arsenal are willing to pay up front and how much Shakhtar are willing to accept in installments.

The versatile 19-year-old has become a regular for the Spanish giants this season but is yet to sign a new contract at the Nou Camp.

Newcastle and Arsenal have both reached out about Balde’s availability as his current contract runs out in the summer of 2024. Already a Spanish international, Balde is a huge talent and per the report his agent, Jorge Mendes, has told Barcelona that they could sell him to generate cash to help their financial situation.

According to Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin, Arsenal are speaking with the Ukrainian club and they are haggling over a transfer fee. Arsenal have reportedly had an offer of over $66 million rejected by Shakhtar. The Ukrainian giants are said to want close to $100 million. Palkin spoke on Thursday and said: “Negotiations are continuing. We receive offers, but they are not the ones we would like to see on our table. Now, literally in five minutes, I will have a phone conversation with Arsenal. We are open to negotiations, ready to exchange ideas and figures. If we will agree, then let it be so. If we will not, then let it be another time.”\nPer our partners in the UK at Sky Sports, there is ‘cautious optimism’ the deal can be completed as Mudryk’s representatives have reportedly already agreed personal terms and are now waiting on the two teams to agree a transfer fee. What would Mudryk bring? He fits Arsenal’s model of being a young, hungry player who can is technically gifted but also has incredible work rate. If he arrives he could allow the likes of Saka and Martinelli to play in slightly different roles and he adds real quality into their attacking rotation. As we’ve seen with the injury to Gabriel Jesus, this Arsenal squad is still pretty thin. But if Arsenal does sign Mudryk, it makes perfect sense and slots in with their identity as a club. Whenever Arsenal have spent big in recent seasons (Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel, Thomas Partey, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White are just a few examples) they have got it largely spot on. (JPW)\nReports say that Arsenal has approached Shakhtar Donetsk with a $67 million bid for in-demand forward Mykhailo Mudryk.\nThe Ukrainian club is said to want over $100 million for the winger, who has eight caps for Ukraine and turns 22 on Jan. 5.\nSome reports have said the move is “imminent,” but Mudryk’s been linked with Manchester City amongst others.

Unless they buck up, the classes of ‘23 will record their club’s worst seasons this century – and in Liverpool’s case since the 1960s.\nJurgen Klopp’s side currently sit eighth in the Premier League table and it’s testament to the club’s consistency over decades they’ve not finished lower than that since Bill Shankly led them into the top flight in 1962.\nIn the following 60 completed seasons, Liverpool have finished higher than their present position on 56 occasions – 14 times as champions.\nOn the other four occasions they have finished eighth. 1962/63 was their first season back after a decade in the Second Division and Graeme Souness was sacked midway through the 1993/94 campaign.\nIn this century, both Kenny Dalglish and Jurgen Klopp presided over eighth-place finishes but can offer impressive cup runs as mitigation.\nLiverpool are at risk of their lowest-placed finish in the top-flight since the 1962 season\nChelsea are in a similarly difficult position and find themselves 11th in the Premier League table\nDalglish’s team reached two Wembley finals in 2011/12, winning the League Cup, though it didn’t save King Kenny who was fired by owner John W Henry.\nKlopp’s debut season arriving midway through 2015/16 also brought moderate league results though the German can point to steering the club to a Europa League final.\nVictories over two legs in that competitions against Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund meant sacrificing points domestically and they ended a busy campaign by winning only one of their final five league games.\nKlopp’s current side don’t have that excuse having ended all cup commitments by mid-March.\nA challenge for the top-four looks remote given they are 10 points behind Newcastle and Manchester United but they still need points to avoid embarrassment.\nThey are only ahead of ninth-place Brentford on goal difference and if they are overtaken by Thomas Frank’s side in the final reckoning, it would represent their worst league season for 61 years – incentive for Jordan Henderson and his galaxy of international stars.\nChelsea too are set for record-breaking disappointment – despite an unprecedented £550million spent in two transfer widows by new owner Todd Boehly.\nThe Blues, who have turned to club legend Frank Lampard as interim having sacked Graham Potter, have not finished in the bottom half of the table this Century.\nTheir worst placing was 10th in 2015/16 when Jose Mourinho had a meltdown and Guus Hiddink was drafted in to steady the ship.\nThe last time Chelsea finished in the bottom half of the table was well before Roman Abramovich in 1995/96, when they were 11th.\nBoth sides took home a point after their Premier League encounter ended 0-0 on Tuesday\nBruno Saltor (L) took charge of the Blues for the first-time since Graham Potter's sacking\nTo find a time when they finished even lower than that, you have to scroll back to 14th in 1993/94. though player-manager Glenn Hoddle had the consolation of taking his team to Wembley to face Manchester United in the FA Cup final.\nAvoiding those modest targets wasn’t what Boehly expected when signing off a British transfer record on Enzo Fernandez and millions more on Wesley Fofana, Raheem Sterling and Mykhaylo Mudryk.\nChelsea’s get-out card remains the Champions League. If they upset Real Madrid to reach the semi-final, some of the league pain may be softened.\nIf not and they fail to overtake smaller west London neighbours Brentford and Fulham, this will be the worst season at Stamford Bridge for 27 years.\nShare what you think\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group""}",Mykhaylo Mudryk,en

Here’s how it works.\n\nArsenal want Declan Rice as their headline signing this summer – but have a backup in the form of one Everton ace\nArsenal are targeting a £62 million Everton star as the shock backup option to Declan \xa0Rice.\nThat\'s according to one report that says that the Gunners have a Plan B for if they cannot lure West Ham United captain Rice from east London to north this summer. Arsenal could be about to smash their transfer record for the defensive midfielder but with competition from rivals – not to mention a steep asking price – the deal is far from simple.\nThe table-toppers have been beaten to high-profile targets, too, in recent times. January saw Chelsea gazump their rivals for Mykhaylo Mudryk, while the season before, Dusan Vlahovic rejected them for Juventus. Arsenal have failed to meet the asking prices for Moises Caicedo, Pedro Neto and Douglas Luiz in the last year, too.\n\nAs a backup option to Rice, Belgian outlet\xa0Het Nieuwsblad (opens in new tab) has made the claim that Arsenal sporting director Edu Gaspar has been in ""constant contact"" with Everton star Amadou Onana’s entourage.\nThe 21-year-old moved to Merseyside last summer from Lille for a reported £33m including add-ons (opens in new tab) but with the Toffees flirting with relegation, has not had the chance to showcase what he\'s truly capable of.\nIt\'s thought that Onana has a bold price of £62m on his head now – and if Everton were to be relegated this summer, the club may have to sell a number of their assets. There\'s a lot of interest in the Belgian, who could be one of the first out the door.\nWest Ham, ironically, were interested in the player, only getting beaten to his signing late on by Everton. He could still be on their radar in a scenario in which they have to sell Rice.\n\nArsenal are also said to remain keen Moises Caicedo. Brighton rebuffed their approach towards the end of the transfer window, with Jorginho joining instead.\nOnana is valued at €42m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).\nArsenal striker\xa0Gabriel Jesus has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, sparking rumours that the Gunners could have to fight to keep their No.9. Manager Mikel Arteta has\xa0identified nine players who could leave\xa0this summer – while\xa0Rasmus Hojlund is a target up front, along with\xa0Leeds star Wilfried Gnonto.\nElsewhere,\xa0Gabri Veiga has been rumoured to be on Arsenal\'s radar, as has\xa0AC Milan star Brahim Diaz. Declan Rice is thought to be this summer\'s big target, with\xa0Oleksandr Zinchenko sharing a word with him when Ukraine played England, setting tongues wagging.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\nThe best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.\nMark White has been a staff writer on FourFourTwo since joining in January 2020, writing pieces for both online and the magazine.

Das Ergebnis ist desaströs. Beim Aus in der Champions League laufen die Fans weg. Für Besitzer Todd Boehly gab es schon zuvor Spott.\nPermalink: \nhttps://www.faz.net/-i25-b7mda\nVor dem Hinspiel vor einer Woche hatte Todd Boehly den Mund ziemlich voll genommen – nicht nur beim nach eigener Aussage „sehr guten“ Mittagessen, sondern auch bei der Vorhersage für das anstehende Hinspiel im Viertelfinale der Fußball-Champions-League. Der neue Besitzer des FC Chelsea prognostizierte einen 3:0-Sieg seiner Mannschaft. Es kam anders. Real Madrid gewann im heimischen Bernabéu-Stadion mit 2:0 und ließ am Dienstagabend einen weiteren Sieg in dieser Höhe an der Stamford Bridge folgen. Die Spanier zogen ungefährdet ins Halbfinale ein.\nSpätestens als Rodrygo in der 80. Minute auf seinen Führungstreffer zum 0:1 (58.) ganz frei vor dem Tor von Chelsea stand, den Ball stoppte und ihn aus kurzer Distanz über die Linie schoss, hatten auch die immer noch hoffenden Anhänger der Londoner es satt und verließen zu großen Teilen vor dem Abpfiff das Stadion im Stadtteil Fulham, um nach dem Aus ihres Klubs zumindest nicht auch noch im Stau stehen zu müssen. Zu deutlich war der Unterschied zwischen einem Favoriten auf den Titel in der Königsklasse und einer Mannschaft, die derzeit nur schwer als solche zu bezeichnen ist.\nMehr als 600 Millionen Euro hat Boehly in dieser Saison an Transferzahlungen in den Kader gesteckt. Zu sehen ist davon wenig – und das liegt nicht nur daran, dass Interimstrainer Frank Lampard in der entscheidenden Partie gegen Real Madrid im Mittelfeld zunächst lieber auf Eigengewächs Conor Gallagher als auf 70-Millionen-Euro-Zugang Mykhaylo Mudryk setzte. Immer wieder blitzte die fraglos vorhandene Klasse einzelner Spieler auf. Doch eine Idee, geschweige denn ein Plan, wie diese Zusammenstellung von teuren Einzelstücken zu gemeinsamem, dauerhaftem Erfolg kommen will, ist nicht ersichtlich.\nDabei war mehr Spannung am Dienstagabend durchaus möglich. Chancen zur Chelsea-Führung gab es. Doch sie wurden teils kläglich vergeben. N’Golo Kanté traf freistehend im Strafraum einen Volleyschuss nicht richtig (11.), Marc Cucurella scheiterte am herausstürzenden Torwart Thibaut Courtois (45.+1). Wie es besser geht, zeigte Real Madrid, das die wenigen Möglichkeiten, die es gab, zwei Mal eiskalt ausnutzte. Nach einem Fehler von Trevoh Chalobah an der Seitenlinie stürmte Rodrygo allein\xa0Richtung Tor und vollendete, als er am Ende des Wirrwarrs wieder an den Ball kam. Das 0:2 war nur noch ein Kinderspiel.\nWie der Brasilianer den Ball vor dem Tor im Fünfmeterraum noch annehmen konnte, spiegelte die Unterlegenheit Chelseas in diesem Gesamtduell. Zu den Lücken in der Abwehr kam eine erstaunliche Schwäche beim Abschluss, die schon im Hinspiel erkennbar war. Sechs Partien hat der Klub im April absolviert, nur ein Tor hat die Mannschaft geschossen. Zum Aus in der Champions League kommt ein blamabler elfter Platz in der Tabelle der Premier League. Sieben Spieltage vor Schluss sind die Plätze, die in der nächsten Saison zur Teilnahme am Europapokal berechtigen, realistisch nicht mehr erreichbar.\nBeim 1:2 gegen Brighton & Hove Albion am vergangenen Wochenende, bei dem der kleine Klub von der Südküste den Machern an der Stamford Bridge zeigte, dass es nicht Unsummen braucht, um erfolgreich Fußball spielen zu können, kam Boehly in die Kabine. Was genau er dort getan und gesagt hat, darüber gehen die Aussagen auseinander. Lampard spielte den Besuch des Amerikaners als völlig normal herunter. Der frühere Nationalspieler Gary Lineker, bekannt durch pointierte Beobachtungen, schrieb ironisch: „Ich wette, das hat geholfen.“ Eher nicht, wie das Spiel am Dienstagabend zeigte.\nMehr zum Thema\n1/\nGroßer Druck für Frank Lampard\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDarts mit verbundenen Augen beim FC Chelsea\nAus in der Champions League\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlle Träume von Chelsea und Lampard platzen\nManCity in Premier League\n            \n: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHaaland schießt sich warm für den FC Bayern\nKlublegende Lampard, der bei Derby County, Chelsea und Everton als Trainer wenig erfolgreich war und die Zeit bis Saisonende überbrücken soll, redete die Unterlegenheit gegenüber Real schön. „Wir haben 60 Minuten gut gespielt.

"{'content': 'Ediciones:\nFutbol/premier-league\nLa nefasta temporada del Chelsea tras su astronómica inversión ha generado problemas en el club londinense que encara la recta final de la temporada sin opciones de ganar ningún título\nLa reciente eliminación del Chelsea de la Champions League a costa del Real Madrid ha dejado al conjunto \'blue\' sin la posibilidad de ganar ningún título, ya que fueron eliminados de ambas copas, tanto Carabao como FA, por el Manchester City. Y por si fuera poco, los de Lampard son undécimos y están más cerca el descenso (10 puntos) que la zona europea (14 puntos).\nUna temporada nefasta para un club que ha hecho una inversión astronómica en fichajes esta temporada. Un gasto total de 611 millones en fichajes a costa de Todd Boehly, sucesor de Abramovich que tiró la \'casa por la ventana\' en el mercado de fichajes con incorporaciones como Enzo Fernández, Wesley Fofana, Mykhaylo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella, Raheem Sterling... Desembolsó, entre verano e invierno, 611 millones, una cifra de gasto récord en la historia del fútbol.\n\nEl Chelsea tiene un evidente problema ya no solo de rendimiento sino de vestuario. Según mail online, en Inglaterra han vinculado a algunas de las estrellas del Chelsea con una posible salida del club londinense. Según este medio, jugadores como Joao Félix, Ziyech, Pulisic, Sterling, Aubameyang, Koulibaly y Havertz podrían abandonar la disciplina \'blue\' debido a su bajo rendimiento esta temporada.\nTiempos revueltos en un Chelsea que también tiene la incógnita de quién va a ser su entrenador la próxima temporada, ya que Lampard ha encadenado cuatro derrotas en los cuatro partidos en los que ha estado en el banquillo de Stamford Bridge. Suena Naglesmann para que sea el encargado de dirigir desde la banda al conjunto \'blue\' a partir de la temporada que viene, aunque no hay nada decidido según comentan en Mail online.\nDespués de su enorme gasto en fichajes, el Chelsea busca cumplir con las regulaciones del Fair Play financiero después de este desorbitado gasto de fichajes desde el verano pasado. Casi sin opciones de jugar competición europea la próxima temporada , la situación no es sostenible en cuanto a salarios y se buscarán salidas. Todo ello sumado a la más que posible incorporación tanto de Christopher Nkunku y Malo Gusto para la temporada que viene y la vuelta de algunos jugadores de cesiones. Thiago Silva, uno de los pesos pesados del Chelsea habló tras la eliminación del Chelsea en la Champions y dijo que necesitan una estrategia de cara a la próxima temporada.\nAlgunos no pueden formar parte del equipo. Necesitamos parar y poner en marcha una estrategia, de lo contrario, la próxima temporada podríamos cometer los mismos errores\nDespués de la derrota del Chelsea frente al Brighton por 1-2 en Stamford Bridge, el dueño estadounidense del conjunto londinense, según informó Telegraph, bajó al vestuario para dirigirse a los jugadores y pronunciar un discurso en el que describió la temporada de su equipo como ""vergonzosa"".\nMichael Owen, leyenda del fútbol inglés, atacó, sin piedad en \'Talk Sport\' la política de \'comprar cromos\' instaurada por Boehly: ""El error que cometieron al comprar tantos jugadores les va a afectar donde más duele, en el bolsillo. Van a tener que deshacerse de muchos jugadores y algunos no querrán irse, así que tendrán que indemnizarles. Ha sido un error que les va a salir muy caro"".\n""Es uno de los grandes misterios de todos los tiempos, ¿cómo te puedes gastar 600 millones y no traer un jugador que marque goles?\nPepentrao\nLa lista de fichajes asombra, la mitad ni los conozco y por la otra mitad han pagado el triple de lo razonable.\nPQTQuejas\nEs el momento de endiñarles a Hazard como revulsivo\n©  Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

"{'content': 'Ediciones:\nFutbol/premier-league\nLos \'blues\' no tienen opción a ningún título, no jugarán en Europa la próxima temporada, no tienen un \'9\'... y buscan entrenador\nTodd Boehly entró en el mundo del fútbol con un poderoso lema por bandera: ""Poderoso caballero es don Dinero"".Compró el Chelsea a cambio de 4.700 millones de euros, despidió aMarina Granovskaia (mano derecha de Abramovich), dejó ir a Bruce Buck (presidente) y Petr Cech (exjugador y asesor técnico) y se \'autocoronó\' director deportivo.\nEl sucesor de Abramovich tiró la \'casa por la ventana\' en el mercado de fichajes: Enzo Fernández, Wesley Fofana, Mykhaylo Mudryk, Marc Cucurella, Raheem Sterling... Desembolsó, entre verano e invierno, 611 millones, una cifra de gasto récord en la historia del fútbol que ha llevado a los \'blues\' a convertirse en el primer equipo inglés que acumula 1.000 millones en pérdidas.\nEl problema es que, en fútbol, rara vez 1+1 suman 2 y esa inversión no ha dado réditos sobre el \'verde\'. En parte, nuevamente, por culpa de la volátil política deportiva de Boehly. El sucesor de Abramovich celebró que se cumplían 100 días de su toma de posesión destituyendo a Thomas Tuchel y pagando 20 millones al Brighton por el segundo entrenador más caro de la historia:Graham Potter.\nEl fichaje de Potter tampoco salió bien. El Chelsea, por primera vez desde 1989, dijo adiós a la Copa y a la Copa de la Liga en la primera eliminatoria. Mientras tanto, se \'desangraba\' en la Liga: cogió al equipo cuarto, a cinco puntos del Arsenal, y lo dejó undécimo.\nEl fichaje a la desesperada de Lampard -Bruno Saltor dirigió un partido entre medias- no ha hecho sino empeorar las cosas. \'Frankie\' se ha convertido en el primer entrenador en la historia del Chelsea que pierde sus primeros cuatro partidos. Cuatro tropiezos que han supuesto que los \'blues\' digan adiós a la Champions frente al Real Madrid -el único torneo que optaban a ganar ya- y digan adiós a las escasas opciones que tenían de jugar en Europa vía Premier.\nAhora mismo, están más cerca del descenso (12 puntos) que de los puestos de Europa League (14) y de Champions (17). Lo peor es que tienen siete partidos por delante... sin nada en juego.\nLa crisis del Chelsea ha desatado la ira en Inglaterra. ""Conocí este club con cierta clase durante la era Abramovich, pero hoy me falta. Me cuesta mucho ver cómo se deshacían de ciertas personas... deberían volver a los principios y valores que tenían. Ya no reconozco mi club"",aseguró Didier Drogba tras caer ante el Madrid. ""Son comentarios de Drogba"", se limitó a responder Lampard, que \'resiste\' mientras los \'blues\' negocian con Luis Enrique y Julian Nagelsmann con vistas a la próxima temporada.\nMichael Owen atacó, sin piedad en \'Talk Sport\' la política de \'comprar cromos\' instaurada por Boehly: ""El error que cometieron al comprar tantos jugadores les va a afectar donde más duele, en el bolsillo. Van a tener que deshacerse de muchos jugadores y algunos no querrán irse, así que tendrán que indemnizarles. Ha sido un error que les va a salir muy caro"".\nCometieron un fallo comprando tantos jugadores. Van a tener que deshacerse de muchos y algunos no querrán irse, por lo que tendrán que indemnizarles. Les puede salir muy caro\nNo le alta razón a Owen, que cuestionó también la incomprensible falta de un \'9\'. Sólo tiene uno sano de garantías, Aubameyang, y en enero le retiró de la lista de la Champions. ""Es uno de los grandes misterios de todos los tiempos, ¿cómo te puedes gastar 600 millones y no traer un jugador que marque goles? No tienen mordiente arriba. Lo han hecho al revés de como deberían"".\nEs uno de los grandes misterios de todos los tiempos, ¿cómo te puedes gastar 600 millones y no traer un jugador que tenga influencia en los goles?\nLe sobran, eso sí, jugadores de tres cuartos de campo en adelante: Havertz, Mount, Joao Félix, Sterling, Mudryk, Madueke, Pulisic, Ziyech... No es de extrañar, con ese panorama, que sólo hayan marcado 30 goles en 31 jornadas de Premier, menos que Haaland (32). Lo dicho: el Chelsea de Boehly \'hace aguas\'.\nPeteLange\nhay mucha gente que cree que la Premier es mejor porque pagan barbaridades por jugadores mediocres, Cucurella 70 kilos....ahi es ná\nRealBetis35\nOtro se gastaron 450 entre Coutinho dembele y Griezmann y fue acierto.!!!\n© Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

He has implemented an attractive style of attacking football.\nSpurs are also keen on Julian Nagelsmann but reports in The Sun claimed chairman Daniel Levy had reservations about the 35-year-old German because of his age.\nHowever, it is not thought to be a deal-breaker and Nagelsmann remains the favourites with the bookies.\nHe had been the leading contender for the Chelsea job before he pulled out of the race after being spooked by the club's process and thinking he was a shoo-in for the role.\nMail Sport previously reported Spurs are exploring an interest in Sporting Lisbon head coach Ruben Amorim.\nThe Portuguese is rated among the best emerging coaches in Europe and is on Tottenham’s radar. He has also been on Chelsea’s radar.

"{'content': 'Arsenal have released a statement to criticise the behaviour of a minority inside the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night against Chelsea after an arrest was made\nArsenal have condemned the behaviour of one of their supporters after an arrest was made following the win over Chelsea on Tuesday night.\nA 21-year-old Arsenal fan has been arrested for shining a laser into the eyes of Chelsea winger Mykhaylo Mudryk during the home side’s 3-1 win. Mudryk was booed by the Gunners supporters during the match before a green laser was visible on his face in the second half of the match.\nAn Arsenal statement said: “An arrest has been made following the use of a laser during last night’s match. This behaviour is dangerous and totally unacceptable, and we will fully support the police with their enquiries. We will obviously take the strongest possible action.”\nA Metropolitan Police statement said: ""A 21-year-old man was arrested at the Emirates Stadium during the Arsenal v Chelsea match on 2 May on suspicion of a public order offence. He has been taken into custody.\n""As the result of an anti-ticket touting operation before the Arsenal v Chelsea match, three men were arrested on suspicion of ticket touting and one man arrested on suspicion of breaching his football banning order. They were taken into custody.""\nMudryk posted a picture of the laser shining on his face on his Instagram account alongside the caption “it’s ok”. He was playing at the Emirates Stadium for the first time after joining Chelsea in a £88.5million transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk in January.\nThe Ukraine international had been Arsenal’s number one transfer target, but ended up moving to west London after Chelsea owner Todd Boehly gazumped the Gunners. He had a relatively quiet 19 minutes against Arsenal after coming on for Enzo Fernandez in the second half.\nChelsea made it six straight defeats under the management of Frank Lampard, with Arsenal blowing them away inside the opening 34 minutes. Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard scored the opening two goals before Gabriel Jesus made the game safe.\nNoni Madueke pulled a goal back in the second half, but the score could have been worse had it not been for goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. The win sent Arsenal back to the top of the Premier League as they ended a run of four games without a win, while Chelsea are now languishing in 12th.\n“As a team, we put in a good effort today after the four games we didn’t win, and I think we needed the three points. It was very important,” Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka said.\n“We needed a reaction for the fans, for ourselves as well to come back with confidence and hopefully we can continue like this for the next four games.”\nComing into the game Arsenal had drawn against Liverpool, West Ham and Southampton before being thrashed 4-1 by Manchester City. They are now two points ahead of City, but Pep Guardiola’s side have two games in hand and remain heavy favourites for the title.\n“We have to do our job to take as many points as possible,” Xhaka added. “After that, we have to hope a little bit because we don’t have everything in our hands.\n“In the Premier League everything is possible. People are speaking about us in a good and bad way, but this is part of our job. We have to focus on ourselves, do our job and let’s see after.”\nCan Arsenal challenge for the title?

A Wenger\n\n\nBy Bulldog Drummond\nThrough this season we have, before most matches, had a look at the league table based on the last six games, as this can often indicate which way a match is likely to turn, better than looking at the conventional table for the whole season.\nAnd normally in doing this we don’t run the whole “last six” table, but just the bit at the top showing Arsenal, and wherever the club Arsenal are playing is sitting.\nBut really, to fully appreciate the drop in Arsenal’s form of late and the position of Chelsea, we do need to see the full table…\n\nYes indeed.\xa0 Arsenal, in terms of current form, are a mid-table team, and Chelsea are on the edge of relegation.\nOf course this doesn’t actually mean that Arsenal are not qualifying for the Champions League next season, nor that Chelsea are heading for the Championship, but it does show the decline in both clubs of late.\nBut there is more to this “last six” table than expressing our dismay at how the challenge for the league title fell apart in one prolonged blip (as we have been calling these downturns).\xa0 And that is the level of goals.\xa0 \xa0In the past six games, despite the downturn,\xa0 Arsenal have scored 16 goals, while Chelsea have scored… err…. three.\nAnd that is with Mykhaylo Mudryk who cost €70.00m, Raheem Sterling at €56.20m, Noni Madueke (€35.00m), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (€12.00m), David Datro Fofana (€12.00m), and João Félix on loan for a hefty fee (of which no one is quite sure how much it is).\nAll of which really ought to indicate to everyone, that buying players can help but is not guaranteed to help.\xa0 Tactical awareness and careful planning is needed.\nOf course there was a time in the long dim and distant past that Chelsea used to beat Arsenal.\xa0 For example between April 2004 and February 2017 the clubs played each other 32 times in the Premier League, Champions League, Community Shield, FA Cup and League Cup.\xa0 Chelsea won 19 of those games, seven were draws and just six were won by Arsenal.\xa0 \xa0 Put another way, 59% of the games were won by Chelsea and just 19% by Arsenal.\nIt really is a frightening statistic, not least because it starts in 2004 just after the end of the unbeaten season, when Arsenal were still a force and a half to be reckoned with.\nBut let us move on.\xa0 Between 27 May 2017 and 6 November 2022 the clubs played each other 17 times and in those games Chelsea won four, there were four draws and Arsenal won nine.\xa0 24% won by Chelsea, and 53% won by Arsenal.\xa0 \xa0One might consider a metaphor of a pendulum at this point.\nThis change of fortune and the change in league position with Chelsea now lying 12th in the league also comes at a cost.\xa0 \xa0Abramovich is said to have bought Chelsea for £140m, spend £1.6 billion on the club after that, and then been forced to walk away because of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.\nSo there we have it.\xa0 After buying Chelsea in 2003, Abramovich ended up with nothing. Not even a return of the 1.6 billion pounds of loans he had to write off to allow the club to be sold and continue playing.\nAs for the club, Chelsea spent £546.1m last summer and in the January 2023 transfer window while Arsenal spent £171.8m.\xa0 \xa0And yet despite the greatest and clearest proof ever that just buying and buying and buying does not in any way ensure success on the pitch, the media’s coverage of football day by day is still by and large, about transfers most of which will, of course, never happen.\nOh yes and Manchester United looks like it might be sold to a very rich person.\nNext up: the team.\nYes Chelsea spent £546.1m. But they did it without  buying a centre forward, the one position everyone could see they needed to fill. Looking deeper its not clear what their strategy actually was or if they even had one. The big difference from the Abramovich era is that Roman would hire a manager then go out and buy the players the manager wanted. Then when the manager was inevitably fired he’d do the same thing again.  The current owners on the other hand  bought a bunch of players then hired a manager to try and turn them into a team. So yes spending doesn’t ensure success but its worked pretty well for Manchester City over the years and Chelsea under the Russian. Clearly though its not just how much you spend but how well you spend it. Chelsea have spent about as badly as its possible to spend.\njod\nVery well said.\nI have said, and have demonstrated it many times with statistics, that spending big is the ONLY way to succeed.\nYes, you can spend big and fail, especially now as so many teams spend big, but you cannot, not spend big and expect to succeed.\nWe are back were we are not simply because we have Arteta, but because we have Arteta, AND we have allowed him to spend a lot of money, in fact one hell off a lot more money that Wenger was ever allowed to spend.\nChelsea are where they are because they have an idiot owner who has so much more money than sense.

They will also sign RB Leipzig forward Christopher Nkunku and Lyon right-back Malo Gusto, showing that Chelsea's ownership will continue splashing cash to land talented young players.\nHowever, having already spent hundreds of millions of pounds to acquire players like Enzo Fernández, Mykhaylo Mudryk, Wesley Fofana, and João Félix, Chelsea will need to focus on outgoings even more than incoming transfers this time around.\nUnder former manager Graham Potter, Chelsea had so many first-team players that training sessions featured 9-vs-9 practice games as well as 11-on-11 games. This signals how badly Chelsea's squad must be cut.\nMidfielder Mason Mount is entering the final year of his contract and seems likely to leave over the summer, while long-serving N'Golo Kanté is out of contract following the season.\nJoão Félix could be returned to Atlético Madrid when his loan ends, while United States international Christian Pulisic seems a strong bet to leave. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been strongly linked with a return to FC Barcelona.\n©  Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.\nFollow us""}",Mykhaylo Mudryk,en
