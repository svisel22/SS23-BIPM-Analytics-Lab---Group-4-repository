" manchester united are set to improve their squad further this summer, with a player dubbed the next thierry henry on the radar manchester united are preparing a big move for a player dubbed 'the new thierry henry'. the red devils have hit the buffers of late after winning the league cup, struggling in recent matches against the likes of liverpool and southampton. while there is an acceptance that they need to strengthen across the field, the lack of a world-class striker alongside marcus rashford on the left flank is one of the clearest weaknesses in the team. manchester united have been linked extensively with harry kane and victor osimhen in recent weeks - but with both players comes the problem of negotiating with the infamously hard-nosed tottenham hotspur and napoli. a solution may have presented itself, however. according to\xapianetamilan (opens in new tab) in italy, rafael leao is on the radar for the red devils, as well as being a target for the likes of real madrid, paris saint-germain and united's neighbours, manchester city. the ac milan man was integral to i rossoneri's first scudetto title in years last term striking goals in last season and has hitting another eight in the league this season. crucially for a manager who enjoys positional rotation like erik ten hag, leao is capable from either the left flank or as a centre-forward - similar to the talismanic rashford. the portuguese is locked in contract talks with milan, who he joined in . there is a possibility that he may have outgrown italian football, however - and with his current deal expiring in , this summer might be the best time to cash in on him. compared favourably with the legendary thierry henry, leao has a similar running style for his height and build, coming off the left flank to finish chances centrally. his strength and physicality make him a solid option as a lone no. to complement rashford out left - though he has the pace and trickier to operate on the touchline. after representing his nation at every youth level, leao made his portugal debut in , two years after moving to italy from lille. a % sell-on clause (opens in new tab) was included in his move to milan, however, meaning that the seven-time european champions will likely demand a much higher fee than the EUR million that they paid for his services. leao is valued at EURm by transfermarkt (opens in new tab). the\xaglazer ownership are not guaranteed to sell up\xa- despite bids from\xalifelong fan, sir jim radcliffe\xaand\xasheikh jassim bin hamad al thani. meanwhile,\xamarcus rashford has underlined the importance of positive mentality\xaat old trafford. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR *read free articles per month without a subscription join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.

" tottenham will reject any bids for kane, despite the risk of losing the manchester united target on a free transfer a year later tottenham hotspur will reject any approach for captain harry kane this summer despite the risk of losing him on a free transfer a year later, say reports. the england skipper enters the final year of his spurs contract at the end of the season and has been linked with manchester united. however, sky sports news (opens in new tab) reports that the north london club are ready to take a firm stance this summer amid interest in their all-time top scorer. spurs won't sell kane regardless of whether the -year-old agrees to a contract extension or not, with that prospect looking very unlikely as things stand. tottenham view keeping the striker for another season as more valuable than any transfer fee they would gain from his sale. there were reports earlier on tuesday that united are already looking at alternative targets as they don't want to negotiate with spurs chairman daniel levy and end up facing a drawn-out transfer saga. things could change in january , when kane will be free to agree a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club if he hasn't extended - a situation that could bring bayern munich back into the frame. doubts over kane's future haven't been helped by the club's performances on the pitch this season. manager antonio conte is under pressure after his side suffered a meek exit from the champions league by losing - on aggregate to ac milan in the last-. spurs were knocked out of the fa cup by sheffield united earlier this month too, meaning another trophyless season beckons. champions league qualification is the only remaining ambition, with tottenham currently in fourth place, four points above newcastle but with the magpies having two games in hand. kane, who is valued at EURm by transfermarkt (opens in new tab), has continued to be a reliable source of goals for the club this season, scoring in premier league games. the\xaglazer ownership are not guaranteed to sell up\xa- despite bids from\xalifelong fan, sir jim radcliffe\xaand\xasheikh jassim bin hamad al thani. meanwhile,\xamarcus rashford has underlined the importance of positive mentality\xaat old trafford. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR *read free articles per month without a subscription join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. alasdair mackenzie is a freelance journalist based in rome, and a fourfourtwo contributor since . when not pulling on the fft shirt, he can be found at reuters, the times and the i. an italophile since growing up on a diet of football italia on channel , he now counts himself among thousands of fans sharing a passion for ross county and lazio. manchester united report: dutch defender confirms, 'my transfer is getting closer' how youtube and editing skills secured yannick bolasie his first big break in english football arsenal vs chelsea live stream, match preview, team news and kick-off time for this premier league match by tom hancock april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by tom hancock april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by tom hancock april by tom hancock april (c)",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-03-14T16:58:26Z
" manchester united are launching a bid for a french forward who has been captivating european football this season manchester united are set to send shockwaves across the premier league with a PS million bid for a french forward to bolster their frontline. the red devils have had a good season, finding themselves in the top three in the table and winning the carabao cup, as erik ten hag looks to reestablish manchester united among the elite. tonight, he takes his side to real betis in a bid to win the europa league for a second time. but as good as united have been this season, there are still concerns over the state of the squad right now. marcus rashford has been in stunning form - though fans recognise that another world-class forward is needed. luckily, it looks like one is being lined up. sportbild (opens in new tab) are claiming that united are prepared to offer around a record bid for eintracht frankfurt star randal kolo muani, who has been in scintillating form all season in the bundesliga. the -year-old moved to germany last summer from nantes and has taken european football by storm this term. kolo muani has goals and assists from matches up front - and was a part of the france squad that reached the world cup final, stepping in for the injured christopher nkunku on the eve of the competition. kolo muani ticks plenty of boxes for united, too. physical, fast and technically blessed, the former nantes man is able to operate across the frontline, though has been deployed as a centre-forward almost exclusively this season. frankfurt's kolo muani is just one of a number of forwards being monitored by united. harry kane and victor osimhen were thought to be the top targets - though both would be difficult to prise away from their respective clubs. still, frankfurt are likely to demand a huge fee for their star player this season. kolo muani is valued at EURm by transfermarkt (opens in new tab). the\xaglazer ownership are not guaranteed to sell up\xa- despite bids from\xalifelong fan, sir jim radcliffe\xaand\xasheikh jassim bin hamad al thani. meanwhile,\xamarcus rashford has underlined the importance of positive mentality\xaat old trafford. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR *read free articles per month without a subscription join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week.

"bayer leverkusen became the third side to beat bayern munich in the bundesliga this season, as the champions slumped to a - loss. both goals were penalties given by the var and borussia dortmund await for bayern. for the second time in three weeks, bayern munich were under pressure to remain top of the table. borussia dortmund put in a dominant performance in a - win over cologne on saturday night. to keep pace, bayern needed to step up against a\xaleverkusen team high off qualifying for the europa league quarterfinals. but the showing from the perennial bundesliga champions in leverkusen's bayarena was, instead, a step in the wrong direction. a first half goal from joshua kimmich was canceled out by two penalties from exequiel palacios, resulting in a - win for the home team. the performance was emblematic of an inconsistent bundesliga campaign, and with the klassiker against dortmund after the upcoming international break, bayern are under pressure again to return to form. ""it's very frustrating,"" kimmich told reporters after the game. ""we can all read the table. we all saw our performance today. we need to show that we have interest in all competitions."" bayern had a rare midweek off having ousted paris saint-germain in the champions league round of the week before. but given how the game started, one would guess that leverkusen were the fresher side despite a trip to hungary to see off ferencvaros in the europa league. leverkusen outshot their guests eight to one in the first half. but that one shot, a powerful but deflected joshua kimmich effort from the top of the penalty area, saw the visiting side - up at halftime. but alonso's side stuck with it, with amine adli earning the hosts two penalties -- the first for\xaa challenge from benjamin pavard and then one from dayot upamecano. adli was initially booked for diving in both incidents before the var intervened to award the hosts penalties. palacios converted both to give leverkusen a much-deserved - lead that\xathey would never relinquish. ""that is not what bayern munich stands for,"" hasan salihamidzic, bayern's head of sport, told reporters after the game. ""we allowed a team that played on thursday to overrun us."" the result was the latest example of bayern's inconsistent performances in the bundesliga despite looking unstoppable in the champions league and german cup. the loss in leverkusen came after a wild - victory against augsburg and a harder-than-expected - win against stuttgart -- sides that should be easy wins for perennial bundesliga winners. when asked by dw about bayern's inconsistent league form, kimmich gave a simple answer, blaming his side's mentality going into bundesliga matches. ""i think a lot of it comes down to concentration,"" kimmich said. ""when i see how we concede goals, it\xaoften comes too easy. it's not often that opponents pick us apart and we don't know how to defend them."" salihamidzic agreed: ""this team is so good when it has a good mentality and play % from kickoff. but we are just as bad when we play like we did today."" kimmich didn't mince words about what the result means for the klassiker against dortmund on april . ""the situation has clearly changed,""\xahe said. ""we have to win to return to the top of the table."" recent performances in the champions league would suggest that a win against dortmund is more than possible. that will only come if, like their opponents today, they turn up for the game. edited by: matt pearson'}",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-03-19T18:30:00Z

" check out the transfer rumours of all the players who could move to old trafford ahead of next season while this approach hasn\'t resulted in a premier league title in years, manchester united are invariably always willing to shell out on yet another high-profile transfer in a bid at glory once again. many of the players they are linked with usually don\'t end up joining the club, but if they do, it\'s usually to great fanfare and plenty of expectation. david de gea is often cited as not being good competent enough with the ball at his feet to play long-term for erik ten hag, but that hasn\'t stopped emi martinez\'s dad from posturing to the red devils. speaking to tyc sports, martinez\'s dad said that he personally hopes a move to manchester united materialises amid links with the argentine goalkeeper. however, other reports also suggest de gea\'s time at old trafford is coming to an end, following mistakes made during the europa league defeat to\xasevilla and the fact he is still yet to finalise a new contract with united. according to\xagivemesport, de gea\'s reluctance to accept a pay cut means that the club are now looking at three options to replace him:\xavalencia\'s\xagirogi mamardashvili,\xaporto\'s\xadiogo costa and\xabrentford\'s\xadavid raya. with valencia struggling in la liga right now and in danger of a shock relegation, mamardashvili could well be bought for far less than his value, which is estimated at around PS million.\xachelsea\xaand\xatottenham hotspur\xaboth want the georgian, too. raya has just a year left on his contract and would seem like the smart buy for united, given that they have other targets to acquire across the pitch. the spaniard is well thought of, however, by rivals, while employers brentford may look to tie him down to better terms - especially if they qualify for europe this season. costa, meanwhile, has a release clause of around PSm. with porto unlikely to budge on that, it seems as if the portuguese may well be a last resort if united fail to negotiate other deals or miss out on targets. caughtoffside\xaare claiming that manchester united want to double the wages of inter milan centre-back alessandro bastoni, who is approaching the end of his contract at san siro. the expensive part of the deal would therefore be the wages, which the outlet claims could easily be negotiated with the red devils willing to pay over the odds. spanish publication\xafichajes also suggests united are keen on bastoni in a bid to strengthen their defence. the italian has a release clause of PS million and just a year left on his contract this summer. reports have suggested he has little intention of extending and with both manchester sides interested, united look well poised to beat city to another deal. a mainstay in the ligue side, disasi is touted to move to old trafford and compete with raphael varane for a starting spot. harry maguire and victor lindelof are both reportedly unhappy with their lack of game time this season, which could pave the way for -year-old disasi to join manchester united. disasi and bastoni aren\'t the only defenders being targeted for this summer, though. at right-back, denzel dumfries has been consistently linked with manchester united in recent years, and could finally make the switch in the summer. inter milan are reportedly interested in diogo dalot, too, meaning there could be potential for a swap deal between the two clubs, according to gazzetta dello sport. other right-back options are on the radar, too. with harry maguire struggling for form, ten hag has reportedly identified englishman fikayo tomori as a potential upgrade in the centre of defence, the daily mail writes. tomori has impressed since moving to serie a, has the kind of recovery pace that maguire lacks and is comfortable on both feet and on both sides of a defensive pairing. the england international has controversially seen his game time under gareth southgate limited, too, as the three lions manager opts for maguire - out-of-favour at club level - over the rock of a serie a title win last season. espn report that barcelona midfielder gavi could be available for free in the summer, should the catalan side fail to register him with first-team by july . with la liga unhappy with barcelona flouting their spending limits, it has refused to recognise gavi\'s latest contract with the club, meaning it is null and void. according to the sun, brighton winger kaoru mitoma is high up on erik ten hag\'s shortlist, the manchester united manager impressed with the japan international\'s dazzling displays on the south coast this season. psv midfielder xavi simons desires a move to old trafford this summer to work with compatriot erik ten hag, the -year-old impressed with the former ajax manager\'s coaching ability. global transfer expert ekrem konur believes manchester united share the same interest, and could pounce for him in the transfer window. with manchester united still light in central midfield, the sun are reporting that fulham\'s joao palhinha is a top target for the side. the portuguese midfielder has impressed at craven cottage this season, and would be the perfect replacement for casemiro if the brazilian is ever missing. he will be available on a cut-price deal, though it is still possible negotiations between mount and chelsea will make a breakthrough towards the end of the season. brighton midfielder alexis mac allister will seemingly be highly-sought after this summer, with manchester united among the interested parties. indeed, according to cbs sports, united held discussions with the argentine\'s representatives since world cup . however, brighton will likely command a transfer fee exceeding PS million. manchester united are ""already negotiating"" a deal for ruben neves, in a bid to strengthen their midfield, according to spanish outlet\xasport. belgian journalist\xasacha tavolieri has claimed that\xasouthampton\xastar romeo lavia is on the radar for the -time english champions - which is sure to anger rivals manchester city, who sold him to the south coast last summer. marcel sabitzer has hinted that we wants to stay at\xamanchester united\xabeyond his loan spell, which runs until the end of the season. sabitzer has fuelled rumours in an interview with german outlet\xabild, saying: ""this is initially a project until the summer, then we\'ll see.\xauntil then, i want to give everything here.\xait\'s a loan deal with no options; the situation will be assessed in the summer."" a bonkers swap deal between manchester united and tottenham hotspur could be on the cards, with the former offering dean henderson plus cash in exchange for harry kane. after manchester evening news (opens in new tab) suggested that tottenham are demanding a nine-figure fee upfront for kane, espn reported that manchester united were willing to get creative in their pursuit for england\'s record goalscorer. that involves adding henderson, currently on loan at nottingham forest, into a potential deal between the two sides. kane is also said to be interested in a move to old trafford, with the allure of trophies set to bring his time at tottenham to an end. however, sky sports believe spurs chairman daniel levy isn\'t willing to negotiate for his star striker whatsoever - despite him having just a year left on his contract in the summer. victor osimhen is also heavily linked with a transfer, with manchester united lacking a dominant striker up front. while this would involve a hefty price tag - PS million, according to il mattino - osimhen has said it is an ""ambition"" to move to the premier league one day. napoli president aurelio de laurentiis, meanwhile, recently told\xatnt sports\xavia\xateamtalk that sometimes ""offers can\'t be refused,"" seemingly referencing his star striker, claiming, ""i will never say never. sometimes there are offers you can't refuse, so you never know. to me, though, i hope we'll see them shine for a long time."" should manchester united miss out on both kane and osimhen, there are still alternatives. portuguese outlet correio da manha\xahave claimed that united have held a series of talks with jorge mendes over his client, goncalo ramos. benfica have set a PSm (EURm) exit clause in his deal, with the striker contracted until .\xahowever, he might be available for cheaper. should manchester united look for cheaper alternatives, then brighton\'s evan ferguson might be the answer. the -year-old has scored seven goals in his first appearances for the seagulls, who are challenging for champions league qualification. according to\xafootball insider, united\'s scouts have been watching ferguson closely as they consider making a move before the start of next season. the\xabenfica\xaphenomenon caught attention in qatar as the only player to net a hat-trick at the world cup - and with players portuguese league successfully transitioning to the premier league in recent years, united have reason to believe that the move would work. ac milan\'s raphael leao is also on the radar for manchester united, and could dovetail well with marcus rashford on either the left-wing or as a centre-forward, depending on erik ten hag\'s tactical plan. according to pianetamilan, leao would welcome a move to the premier league, with his contract expiring in . sportbild are claiming that manchester united are prepared to offer around a record bid for\xaeintracht frankfurt\xastar randal kolo muani, who has been in scintillating form all season in the bundesliga. the -year-old moved to germany last summer from nantes and has taken european football by storm this term. kolo muani has goals and assists from matches up front - and was a part of the france squad that reached the world cup final, stepping in for the injured christopher nkunku on the eve of the competition. manchester united\xaare considering a summer swoop for joao felix, with\xachelsea set to opt against making the forward\'s loan from\xaatletico madrid\xapermanent. felix, , joined the blues in january on a deal until the end of the season, having extended his atletico contract until before the move. as such, his price tag will have shot up -

" manchester united captain harry maguire is not in erik ten hag\'s plans - could arsenal provide a solution? manchester united captain harry maguire is set to leave this summer - and arsenal could be the ones that the red devils thank for facilitating the move. maguire has failed to establish himself in erik ten hag\'s set-up since the dutchman arrived at old trafford in the summer. the centre-back was given the captaincy early in his red devils career but it\'s now clear that he has no future at manchester united, with raphael varane and lisandro martinez establishing themselves as the first-choice central defensive partnership. there is a worry, however, that united may not be able to shift their captain (opens in new tab), due to the contract he\'s on, which has been described as ""insane"". yet arsenal might provide an unlikely escape route. west ham united are believed to be interested in three manchester united stars (opens in new tab), maguire, scott mctominay and anthony martial. with the hammers languishing towards the bottom of the table, there is an obvious need to strengthen this summer. and with arsenal said to be in ""pole position"" for PS million-rated declan rice (opens in new tab), it could well be the gunners who finance a move for maguire. united are expected to accept a huge loss on the england international - they bought him for around PSm - but an influx of cash at west ham could give them more to spend on wages. maguire would almost certainly take a pay cut to leave for the london stadium but would still be a high earner, should he make the move. rather like when manchester city bought jack grealish for PSm, west ham may receive a windfall to rebuild, starting with maguire, who is looking to rebuild his reputation. maguire has consistently been picked for england during his time at manchester united (opens in new tab), despite inconsistent form at club level. under gareth southgate, however, he has been one of the three lions\' more reliable performers, giving hope to any club that buys him that he can iron out his issues and thrive once more. the -year-old is valued at EURm by transfermarkt (opens in new tab). the\xaglazer ownership are not guaranteed to sell up\xa- despite bids from\xalifelong fan, sir jim radcliffe\xaand\xasheikh jassim bin hamad al thani. meanwhile,\xamarcus rashford has underlined the importance of positive mentality\xaat old trafford. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR *read free articles per month without a subscription join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. manchester united report: james maddison to move this summer for PS-m arsenal set to lose \'most promising\' wonderkid talent this summer: report how youtube and editing skills secured yannick bolasie his first big break in english football by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by tom hancock april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by ben hayward april by tom hancock april by tom hancock april by tom hancock april (c)",jeremie frimpong,en,2023-03-28T09:58:45Z

(ae)  Carter-Vickers Signs! welcome back to #celticfc, @cameroncv! :four_leaf_clover: -- tottenham hotspur (@spursofficial) june , follow @andyedmls and whether spurs are a top-four team or not at the end of the premier league season will make quite a difference to their recruitment team's works. [\xavideo:\xapremier league analysis ] another central midfielder (more on the attacking than defensive side) might make spurs more dangerous, more consistently, going forward. [ transfer news: liverpool |\xachelsea\xa|\xaman city |\xaarsenal | man united ] below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on tottenham transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. twenty-year-old montpellier striker elye wahi has attracted lots of interest this season with goals and three assists this season. french site\xajeunes footeux says that arsenal and tottenham (as well as psg) have not been put off by that price tag and will look to woo the striker to north london this summer. wahi's a young ,\xa born in january, and he has a contract through the - season so he won't come cheap. the report says montpellier's asking for around $ million. the -foot center forward had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's visit from toulouse. the advanced stats say he can carry the ball above average but basically has been strictly a finisher. sounds like someone could use some schooling from a certain harry kane. (nm) look: a tottenham story that isn't about antonio conte or harry kane... at least entirely. that's because espn says that tottenham's interest in manchester united property/serial loanee dean henderson could be used to lower the cost for kane. henderson was when he joined manchester united from carlisle united in , and he made his senior move in . henderson's on loan to nottingham forest, where it's been no surprise that he shined before going down to injury. henderson was twice sheffield united young player of the year, on loan, and won the championship golden glove in boosting the blades into the premier league. club legend hugo lloris has not been himself this season and is currently hurt, fraser forster is only under contract through -, and young keepers brandon austin and alfie whiteman have limited experience and all on loan. a solution will be needed, and soon. (nm) is a london return on the cards for longtime chelsea man antonio rudiger? maybe, according to spanish language site fichajes. you'll remember that the german center back wasn't exactly angling to leave the blues but uncertainty over the club's ownership following russia's invasion of ukraine and roman abramovich's links to his country's president vladimir putin led to rudiger moving to real madrid. the -year-old has been a regular starter at the bernabeu but the report says continued real links with new backs including rb leipzig's josko gvardiol may unsettle rudiger, who just wants regular playing time and a stable situation. (nm) ins arnaut danjuma - villarreal (loan) jude soonsup-bell - chelsea outs matt doherty (contract termination) as one full back is set to arrive in north london, another has left. right back matt doherty is now expected to join atletico madrid after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract with tottenham. (ae) matt doherty may be leaving tottenham on loan to atletico madrid, according to reports, while fullback djed spence will also be leaving on loan. atleti has plenty of success with their last acquisition of a fullback from spurs, as kieran trippier shined at the wanda metropolitano. and spence reportedly turned down a loan to atleti in favor of a move to rennes in ligue , while bryan gil is going on loan to sevilla. all this as tottenham hopes to land pedro porro from sporting lisbon in a move that's been slow-cooking all month and had plenty of complications. the spence and doherty reports will give spurs fans hope that the porro deal is coming. will the second time be the charm for arnaut danjuma when it comes to the premier league? danjuma joins spurs on loan for the rest of the season. he's been playing plenty of center forward and can give harry kane a rest, but will also be plenty happy to head to the left wing. the bournemouth winger scored times last season in la liga and struck six times in uefa champions league games, including in knockout round games against juventus and bayern munich. the -year-old has six goals in matches across all competitions this season for villarreal. (nm) -- lyall thomas (@skysportslyall) january , -- david ornstein (@david_ornstein) january , football.london has a very spurs-like report that tottenham has 'verbally offered' $ million for leandro trossard after the brighton man expressed his wishes to leave the amex stadium. trossard has reportedly fallen out with seagulls boss roberto de zerbi and brighton's been said to want between $- million for the playmaker. spurs landing trossard for under $ million would be at-worst a good risk and at-best an absolute coup, as the belgian has done big things for brighton. playing with a focal point like harry kane could take him to the next level. (nm) as for trossard, this seems like a deal which could happen in january. the daily mail claim that spurs are among several clubs, including chelsea, who are set to move for the belgian winger. trossard, , is out of contract at brighton next summer and didn't feature in their win at everton or in their - fa cup win at middlesbrough. it seems like a move this month could be possible as brighton will aim to recoup some cash for their talented winger/wing-back. trossard has added goals and assists to his game over the last months and was a key cog in graham potter's success as a hybrid wing-back. however, roberto de zerbi could use kaoru mitoma in that role and brighton will look to move on trossard in january. spurs need to upgrade their wing-back potions and if trossard comes in on the left, it would allow ivan perisic to play further up the pitch. alternatively, trossard is also comfortable playing as a winger or attacking midfielder and he is proven in the premier league. is he the type of player who can turn spurs into a guaranteed top four team? probably not. is he a top quality addition who has the potential to slot in seamlessly? he is. (jpw) yes, tottenham's just splashed plenty of cash on a star left winger in richarlison, but would the versatility of martin terrier make him a great fit to compete with the brazilian as well as heung-min son? free-scoring rennes forward terrier is said to be a target for tottenham and manchester united\xaas both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the ligue outfit regarding the -year-old. price tag? it reportedly starts around $ million. terrier has scored and assisted on the regular in france's top flight. he scored goals last season and has eight in matches this season. the left wing can also play center forward amongst other positions. he's chipped in three goals in the europa league this campaign and also had provided assists across all competitions since the start of last season. very strong in the air and plenty good in combination play, terrier has posted impressed xg and xa numbers and could combine with kane but also deputize for the exhaustively-used cf. he may be a better fit for spurs but might man united before more willing to spend to get him? (nm) in richarlison - everton ($ million) - more yves bissouma - brighton ($ million) djed spence - middlesbrough (up to $ million) iyenoma udogie - udinese ($ million - loaned back) clement lenglet - barcelona (loan) ivan perisic - inter milan (free transfer) - more fraser forster - southampton (free transfer) out steven bergwijn - ajax ($. million) cameron carter-vickers - celtic ($. million, plus $. million possible add-ons) jack clarke - sunderland (undisclosed) pierluigi gollini - atalanta (end of loan) and there it is: a five-year contract for the below-mentioned teenage left back, the first year going back to udine on loan. iyenoma ""destiny"" udogie has very promising advanced stats according to fb reference, comparable to atletico madrid star renan lodi, spurs' sergio reguilon, gladbach's joe scally, and brentford's sergi canos. (nm) :studio_microphone: ""it\'s a big dream come true"" -- tottenham hotspur (@spursofficial) august , but there's a twist. there's always a twist. with superstar paul pogba arriving back at juventus this summer and expected to eat up plenty of the minutes mckennie was previously getting, pogba has just gone down with a knee injury in preseason. that requires surgery and it means juve may not move on mckennie this summer after all. another twist? mckennie is yet to feature on juventus' preseason tour of the united states of america as he was unused substitute in each of their games against barcelona and chivas guadalajara. during the tour juve boss max allegri has stated that mckennie is working his way back to full fitness, so maybe there's nothing to read into here, but it is a little odd that juventus haven't given any minutes to one of the best usmnt players on their u.s. tour, right? perhaps they aren't risking him being injured as a transfer away is imminent? mckennie seems fairly happy at juventus but it seems inevitable he will end up in the premier league at some point.

[ more:\xahow to watch premier league in usa\xa] but, yes, all focus is on goodison park, where everton did what it needed to claim another season in the premier league and fans made sure the club knew that one day of success doesn't make amends for two seasons of big struggles. here's where our writers are living, as joe prince-wright (jpw), andy edwards (ae), and nicholas mendola (nm) share their observations from across the most recent pl games. . toffees shake off slow start, save premier league status (everton - afc bournemouth): everton was set up with five at the back from the start and it was too negative. sean dyche got it right though. all they needed was one loose ball to drop to the right on-rushing central midfielder and it did in the second half as abdoulaye doucoure hammered home. it was a brilliant finish in what wasn't a brilliant game (dyche called it ""hideous""). but everton and dyche don't care. with loads of injuries they found a way to get it done and the history books show that everton have still never been relegated from the premier league and only arsenal have a longer active top-flight streak as they will be playing at england's top table next season, their th consecutive at the top level. off the pitch there are financial issues to solve which could impact them next season but dyche has done his job and if everton are smart they should give him the tools to rip things up and rebuild the squad. just staying up like this can't happen again to everton. they said that last season but look what happened. this time they have to make sure they are never in the relegation scrap again. a club of everton's size should never be in this situation. (jpw) . too little, too late for foxes as win not enough (leicester - west ham): ""too little, too late"" may go down as the story of the foxes season. leicester did not get its recruitment plans correct -- somewhat forced by financial fair play -- and then put too much faith in brendan rodgers to make things work. dean smith got some performances out of this men, few better than sunday, but this ultimately feels like a\xafait accompli:\xasometimes, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. despite big seasons from harvey barnes and james maddison, this was that. there's also the question of playing for a draw against newcastle on monday, but let's not heap criticism on dean smith for taking a calculated risk. he deserves better. (nm) . leeds final game of relegation campaign too familiar (leeds - spurs): it was a nightmare start for leeds, who needed not only a victory of their own but also points to be dropped by both everton and leicester above them. tottenham's first foray into leeds' penalty area ended with kane hammering the ball past joel robles. the second frame was a new half but same story for leeds, who conceded once again barely a minute into the second half. kane turned provider this time, as he lofted a blind ball into the channel for the overlapping pedro porro, who barely had a sight of goal with robles smothering the near post. but, porro placed a pinpoint strike just inside the far post from a tight angle. big sam couldn't fix the defense and maybe it was unfixable. leeds didn't keep a clean sheet after february . at least they gave their fans a goal in nearly every game during that run to relegation. (ae). . ten hag's men finish strong to reset standards (manchester united - fulham): it's difficult not to talk big picture after a championship sunday like this where the top four was sorted before the matchday began in england. manchester united is in as good shape as it's been in some time because it had success this season\xawhile building upward from its foundation. yes, the club still has some older key pieces in casemiro and raphael varane, but erik ten hag's system looks ready for finer ingredients and the boss will now have a great idea of what pieces work and what pieces are for someone else's project. this was a successful year for manchester united, the type that will make sure that success at manchester united is measured in a relatively new but still very familiar way: by bigger ambition. (nm) . gunners show glimpse that hunger for more remains (arsenal - wolves): it would have been easy for arsenal to mail this one in given their poor finish to the season which stopped them from winning the premier league title. but the young gunners dug in and impressed as they finished with a flourish and proved they are hungry to close the gap on man city next season. they can do it and with smart recruitment in midfield and defense this summer, arsenal can acquire the extra squad depth they need to have more staying power next season. this was more than a - win. it was about showing they are here to stay. and they are. (jpw) . saints show talent to come straight back up (southampton - liverpool): it was a sad day for saints but in james ward-prowse, carlos alcaraz, and kamaldeen sulemana they showed they have talented players who can lead their championship playoff push next season. but will those star players still be around? saints now need to cut the deadwood, start again with a new manager, and try their best to keep the six or so players they have in their current squad who will be starters in the championship. saints need to follow the way fulham and bournemouth rebounded as they hit the reset this summer. there are stars at saints but they needed defensive solidity, a clear playing style and more experience if they're going to get the best out of their undoubted talents. (jpw). . bees finish with win over much-changed champions'\xa(brentford - man city): it was a long wait for the game's only goal, but the brentford fans got to celebrate once more as they closed out a brilliant second season in the top flight. bryan mbeumo laid the ball back to ethan pinnock, who came streaking into the penalty area completely unmarked. pinnock guided a low strike out of ederson's reach to secure victory no. on the bees' season. city started rico lewis, kalvin phillips, cole palmer, and sergio gomez, and its only sub was -year-old newcomer shea charles. they still out-attempted the hosts - while keeping percent of the ball. (ae) . cooper, hodgson finish unexpected jobs well done (crystal palace - nottingham forest): neither nottingham forest boss steve cooper nor palace counterpart roy hodgson would've seen themselves in this exact position earlier this season. yes, cooper might've thought his team would take time to adjust to the premier league but did he expect a final few safe weekends without real repercussions? probably not, but he did very well to navigate what became a dragged-out process and forest did well to stick with the man who got them to the pl. hodgson was retired at the start of the season and it surprised many that palace cut ties with patrick vieira only to bring hodgson back. the club legend did well right away, though, and he'il only be more beloved should he decide to retire (again).

[ more:\xahow to watch premier league in usa\xa] but, yes, all focus is on goodison park, where everton did what it needed to claim another season in the premier league and fans made sure the club knew that one day of success doesn't make amends for two seasons of big struggles. here's where our writers are living, as joe prince-wright (jpw), andy edwards (ae), and nicholas mendola (nm) share their observations from across the most recent pl games. . toffees shake off slow start, save premier league status (everton - afc bournemouth): everton was set up with five at the back from the start and it was too negative. sean dyche got it right though. all they needed was one loose ball to drop to the right on-rushing central midfielder and it did in the second half as abdoulaye doucoure hammered home. it was a brilliant finish in what wasn't a brilliant game (dyche called it ""hideous""). but everton and dyche don't care. with loads of injuries they found a way to get it done and the history books show that everton have still never been relegated from the premier league and only arsenal have a longer active top-flight streak as they will be playing at england's top table next season, their th consecutive at the top level. off the pitch there are financial issues to solve which could impact them next season but dyche has done his job and if everton are smart they should give him the tools to rip things up and rebuild the squad. just staying up like this can't happen again to everton. they said that last season but look what happened. this time they have to make sure they are never in the relegation scrap again. a club of everton's size should never be in this situation. (jpw) . too little, too late for foxes as win not enough (leicester - west ham): ""too little, too late"" may go down as the story of the foxes season. leicester did not get its recruitment plans correct -- somewhat forced by financial fair play -- and then put too much faith in brendan rodgers to make things work. dean smith got some performances out of this men, few better than sunday, but this ultimately feels like a\xafait accompli:\xasometimes, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. despite big seasons from harvey barnes and james maddison, this was that. there's also the question of playing for a draw against newcastle on monday, but let's not heap criticism on dean smith for taking a calculated risk. he deserves better. (nm) . leeds final game of relegation campaign too familiar (leeds - spurs): it was a nightmare start for leeds, who needed not only a victory of their own but also points to be dropped by both everton and leicester above them. tottenham's first foray into leeds' penalty area ended with kane hammering the ball past joel robles. the second frame was a new half but same story for leeds, who conceded once again barely a minute into the second half. kane turned provider this time, as he lofted a blind ball into the channel for the overlapping pedro porro, who barely had a sight of goal with robles smothering the near post. but, porro placed a pinpoint strike just inside the far post from a tight angle. big sam couldn't fix the defense and maybe it was unfixable. leeds didn't keep a clean sheet after february . at least they gave their fans a goal in nearly every game during that run to relegation. (ae). . ten hag's men finish strong to reset standards (manchester united - fulham): it's difficult not to talk big picture after a championship sunday like this where the top four was sorted before the matchday began in england. manchester united is in as good shape as it's been in some time because it had success this season\xawhile building upward from its foundation. yes, the club still has some older key pieces in casemiro and raphael varane, but erik ten hag's system looks ready for finer ingredients and the boss will now have a great idea of what pieces work and what pieces are for someone else's project. this was a successful year for manchester united, the type that will make sure that success at manchester united is measured in a relatively new but still very familiar way: by bigger ambition. (nm) . gunners show glimpse that hunger for more remains (arsenal - wolves): it would have been easy for arsenal to mail this one in given their poor finish to the season which stopped them from winning the premier league title. but the young gunners dug in and impressed as they finished with a flourish and proved they are hungry to close the gap on man city next season. they can do it and with smart recruitment in midfield and defense this summer, arsenal can acquire the extra squad depth they need to have more staying power next season. this was more than a - win. it was about showing they are here to stay. and they are. (jpw) . saints show talent to come straight back up (southampton - liverpool): it was a sad day for saints but in james ward-prowse, carlos alcaraz, and kamaldeen sulemana they showed they have talented players who can lead their championship playoff push next season. but will those star players still be around? saints now need to cut the deadwood, start again with a new manager, and try their best to keep the six or so players they have in their current squad who will be starters in the championship. saints need to follow the way fulham and bournemouth rebounded as they hit the reset this summer. there are stars at saints but they needed defensive solidity, a clear playing style and more experience if they're going to get the best out of their undoubted talents. (jpw). . bees finish with win over much-changed champions'\xa(brentford - man city): it was a long wait for the game's only goal, but the brentford fans got to celebrate once more as they closed out a brilliant second season in the top flight. bryan mbeumo laid the ball back to ethan pinnock, who came streaking into the penalty area completely unmarked. pinnock guided a low strike out of ederson's reach to secure victory no. on the bees' season. city started rico lewis, kalvin phillips, cole palmer, and sergio gomez, and its only sub was -year-old newcomer shea charles. they still out-attempted the hosts - while keeping percent of the ball. (ae) . cooper, hodgson finish unexpected jobs well done (crystal palace - nottingham forest): neither nottingham forest boss steve cooper nor palace counterpart roy hodgson would've seen themselves in this exact position earlier this season. yes, cooper might've thought his team would take time to adjust to the premier league but did he expect a final few safe weekends without real repercussions? probably not, but he did very well to navigate what became a dragged-out process and forest did well to stick with the man who got them to the pl. hodgson was retired at the start of the season and it surprised many that palace cut ties with patrick vieira only to bring hodgson back. the club legend did well right away, though, and he'il only be more beloved should he decide to retire (again).

[ transfer news: liverpool | chelsea | tottenham | man city\xa| man united ] below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on arsenal transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. here is more from sky germany\xareporter uli kohler: ""tuchel had a phone call with rice. i don't know what they were talking about - maybe money, maybe about what he can expect here [in munich]. bayern is keen on him. they need a strong defensive midfielder but everybody knows there are a lot of other clubs interested in him. bayern could afford it. they would like to keep it below EURm [PS.m]. they have to look at their accounts very closely but i think they can afford it."" rice has long been linked with a move to arsenal or manchester united but it is believed that west ham's asking price for their captain and central midfielder (who is out of contract next summer) is putting up premier league clubs. bayern appear to be ready to pay close to the $ million west ham want for rice. is he worth it? he is. there is perhaps no better two-way central midfielder under the age of in europe and rice's ceiling is extremely high. (jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) mikel arteta is targeting -year-old rb leipzig center back mohamed simakan, though he'll face competition from within the premier league according to\xafichajes. simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) with just one year remaining on his current contract, declan rice is all but certain to leave west ham this summer, as arsenal and newcastle are both ) preparing to be in next season's uefa champions league, and ) very interested in the -year-old services. montpellier striker elye wahi's goals and three assists this season have arsenal and tottenham (as well as psg) looking to woo the striker to north london this summer, according to french site\xajeunes footeux. wahi turned in january and he has a contract through the - season so he won't come cheap. the report says montpellier's asking for around $ million. the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. long-linked with arsenal and liverpool before moving to real, tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for paris saint-germain, chelsea, and manchester united. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) a report from the daily mail says arsenal have submitted a second bid for moises caicedo, with an improved offer of $. million going in. brighton are said to want $ million for caicedo. he did not play against liverpool in the fa cup on sunday and reportedly he will not be around the team until feb. , after the transfer deadline. brighton have told caicedo they want him to stay but his social media posting asking to be allowed to leave has put the writing on the wall. will arsenal up their offer and get their main ahead of chelsea?

(jpw) excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc -- fabrizio romano (@fabrizioromano) january , reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. marca\xasays that fresneda missed valladolid training amid reports that arsenal matched bvb's $ million bid for the back. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially.

(jpw) -- arsenal (@arsenal) january , -- fabrizio romano (@fabrizioromano) january , arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place. (jpw) the -year-old england midfielder is part of the irons' potent midfield with lucas paqueta and tomas soucek, but has been said to want uefa champions league football and th-place west ham is well off top-half standards so far this season. rice was long ticketed for old club chelsea, but the blues are said to prefer enzo fernandez and other options for the center of the park.

(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) mikel arteta is targeting -year-old rb leipzig center back mohamed simakan, though he'll face competition from within the premier league according to\xafichajes. simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) with just one year remaining on his current contract, declan rice is all but certain to leave west ham this summer, as arsenal and newcastle are both ) preparing to be in next season's uefa champions league, and ) very interested in the -year-old services. montpellier striker elye wahi's goals and three assists this season have arsenal and tottenham (as well as psg) looking to woo the striker to north london this summer, according to french site\xajeunes footeux. wahi turned in january and he has a contract through the - season so he won't come cheap. the report says montpellier's asking for around $ million. the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. long-linked with arsenal and liverpool before moving to real, tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for paris saint-germain, chelsea, and manchester united. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

"it seems that ""citing gun research without bothering to read it first"" is no longer an affliction specific to judge ho! george washington university law school gadfly jonathan turley watched the state of the union last night and has some thoughts on the prospect of an assault weapons ban to share. and, like judge ho, when he found that these thoughts were bereft of evidentiary support, he just went ahead and mischaracterized whatever evidence he could find. remember folks, he's definitely not using his dwindling credibility for ""wrongful ends."" during the state of the union, president biden cited the assault weapons ban from , stating, ""in the years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. after republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled."" both of these statements are true. we can quibble over whether the ban deserves percent of the credit for this decline or if an identical ban today would deliver the same result, but as far as it goes, there used to be a ban and it corresponded with reduced gun violence. turley does not like that these claims are true. or at least ""the people who give jonathan turley television bookings"" do not like that these claims are true, though at this point that distinction may be moot. so turley fires up his blogging machine to complain that ""the president's factual claim is far from established."" however, the cause-and-effect claim has never been well-established. support for this claim could be based on a \xa study in the journal of trauma and acute care surgery that found that ""mass-shooting related homicides in the united states were reduced during the years of the federal assault weapons ban of to "". however, the authors said that this reduction was merely ""observational"" and that the act was not clearly the cause of the reduction in shootings and deaths. as for what the study actually concluded: mass-shooting fatalities were % less likely to occur during the federal ban period (relative rate, .; % confidence interval, .-.). potato, po-tah-to, tomato, toma-mass murder. he also cites a research brief put out by the national institute of justice that said on page -- turley can't be bothered to read a whole ten-page study -- that maybe there were other contributing factors to the still undisputed through all of turley's citations decline in mass shootings during the policy and corresponding increase after the policy lapsed. can we take a second to consider the profound disrespect turley -- and ho before him -- have for their audience with these cites? it's so easy these days to click on a cite and find out what it actually says, and yet both turley and ho are profoundly confident that no one will expend the modicum of time and effort to check. sadly they're probably right on this score. anyway, we aren't done with turley's whirlwind tour of studies that don't really say what he wants them to say. alas, turley saved the best for last, with a link to a justice department study from that guessed that mass shootings probably wouldn't go through the roof if the ban was lifted. which... did not pan out. but, it's even worse than that! this specific study is routinely cited by the nra as proof that assault weapons bans don't work. in fact, it's cited for this claim so often that the author of the study has publicly debunked this characterization: crackerjack research work for an ostensible legal academic! but then, turley can't even cite himself without getting it wrong so maybe he really just doesn't know what he's talking about. biden repeats dubious call and claim on assault weapons in state of the union [jonathan turley] earlier: judge ho apparently didn't bother to read the cases he cited in domestic abuser gun opinion guns / firearms, jonathan turley, law schools we will never sell or share your information without your consent. see our privacy policy. richard glossip was sentenced to die over something it doesn't look like he did: will the supreme court act? there's chilling free speech, and then there's whatever elon thinks he's doing: advertisers are going to love this. i know a broken clock is right twice a day, but lindsey graham?: support for scotus members to have actual accountability grows. florida wants the death penalty for tomasz roman kosowski: hard to argue against premeditation here. wanna keep that biglaw salary? bill like it: the average for billables has dipped. our sites privacy center | do not sell or share my personal information",jonathan tah,en,2023-02-08T21:46:59Z

"shabbateanism (shabta'ut) was a jewish messianic movement whose widespread influence and profound impact in the th and th centuries remain difficult to comprehend even today. what made so much of world jewry--ashkenazim, sephardim, and mizrahim alike--accept and support the messiahship of shabbtai tzvi and the prophethood of nathan of gaza? what accounts for the reflorescence of mysticism among jewry just as the rationalistic enlightenment was set to dawn in europe? the chmielnicki massacres, which became known as the evil decrees of - (gzeirot tah v'tat), were construed as the cataclysmic events--the birth pangs of messiah (hevlei moshiah)--traditionally believed to usher in the messianic era. in their uprisings against catholic polish feudalism, the cossacks (orthodox christian ruthenians)--and their tatar turkish allies from crimea--slew tens of thousands of jews in a prolonged pogrom: fatality estimates vary widely from , to ,. understandably, the tragedy and trauma of these tumultuous events intensified jewish yearnings for deliverance and expectations of impending redemption. yet while the pogroms were an immediate and important impetus, they were localized in eastern europe and alone cannot account for the meteoric rise of shabbateanism throughout world jewry. \t\t in judaism, after isaac luria (haari/arizal) innovated a speculative and abstruse kabbalistic system, messianism permeated mysticism, and belief in the imminent advent of messiah was prevalent among the sages and the laity alike. by the first half of the th century, the dissemination of lurianic kabbalah, at least among kabbalists and rabbis, had cultivated favorable conditions for the expression of messianic impulses and aspirations. the zohar, lurianic kabbalah, christian millenarianism (chiliasm), and the chmielnicki massacres all combined to foster revolution and foment mania. among the jewish laity tens of thousands became true believers and bandwagoners, ardent adherents swept up in the surging waves of messianic enthusiasm and the momentum of a mass movement whose time had come. with the advent of shabbtai tzvi--and his scattered cadre of apostles--jews were divided into believers (ma'aminim) and infidels (koferim); as the frenzy intensified, tensions and suspicions proliferated, splitting communities and families. what follows is a survey of key shabbateans of the early modern period: a native of smyrna (izmir, turkey), moses pinheiro (c. - ce) studied talmud and kabbalah as a youth with his fellow student shabbtai tzvi. there is no indication that he supported shabbtai's original messianic claim in . around , he migrated to\xaleghorn (livorno, italy), where he became a highly respected scholar. when news of the shabbatean movement reached italy, he became one of its most passionate spokesmen and continued to believe in shabbtai's messiahship long after his\xaapostasy. in , as a delegate of leghorn's jewish community, he visited shabbtai at the height of the excitement, but reached smyrna only post-apostasy. there his faith was bolstered by communications he received from both shabbtai and\xanathan\xaof gaza. in , he returned to italy with a delegation from three other communities. in , he hosted nathan at his house during the latter's visit to italy. moses stood at the center of the shabbateans in leghorn and corresponded with shabbtai over the years. in , he was still considered a believer; when and whether he finally renounced his belief remains uncertain. his daughter was the mother of the well-known kabbalist and rabbi,\xajoseph ergas, who kept silent about his grandfather's shabbatean connections. he was lauded for his piety and asceticism by ergas' disciple,\xamalakhi hakohen\xaof leghorn. several of his recollections of shabbtai are extant. his disciples included abraham miguel cardozo. advertisement abraham miguel cardozo (- ce), a native of rio seco (spain), was born into a family of portuguese conversos from celorico da beira (portugal). he and his older brother fernando isaac studied medicine at university of salamanca (in addition, he studied christian theology); while his brother was studious, abraham was inclined to serenade ladies from beneath their balconies. he completed his training nevertheless and lived for a time with his brother in neighboring madrid. in , he migrated to italy, where he settled first in venice (and became a disciple of moses zacuto) then in neighboring leghorn (livorno). in italy he reverted formally to his ancestral faith of judaism, either in venice or in leghorn, where he established himself as a physician and studied kabbalah under moses pinheiro. he migrated to egypt, where he settled in and around cairo for five years and studied lurianic kabbalah (and may have first met shabbtai tzvi). in /, he migrated to tripoli (libya) and lived there for about a decade. once prosperous--thanks to the recommendation by the grand duke of tuscany to othman, the bey of tripoli--he married two wives. in , with the advent of shabbateanism, he assumed the mantle of a prophet and claimed to have experienced revelations by means of dreams and visions. he dispatched circulars in support of shabbtai and justified the latter's apostasy on the grounds that messiah needed to be counted among sinners to atone for israel's sins (although he opposed the apostasy of other shabbateans, as well as religious antinomianism in general). abraham averred that opposition to shabbtai was necessary so that belief in him would constitute a leap of faith. in , he wrote that the ottoman authorities refrained from executing shabbtai to avoid making a martyr of him and engendering a new religion. that same year, he was accused by the rabbinate of smyrna (izmir, turkey) of being remiss in his religious observance, but was defended in writing by the religious judges (dayyanim) on the rabbinical court (beit din) of tripoli. he corresponded with other leaders of the movement, including nathan of gaza, abraham yakhini, and later heschel tzoref, as well as with shabbtai himself. in , he sent his theological tract boker avraham to shabbtai, but garnered no response. that same year, after intensively propagating shabbateanism, he was banned from tripoli. he migrated to tunis (tunisia), where he became physician to the local ruler and remained for nearly two years. he was additionally excommunicated by the rabbinates of smyrna and venice. in , he returned to leghorn, but the local council soon demanded his isolation from the community. in , he returned to smyrna, where he attracted many disciples among the local shabbateans, including elijah hakohen haitamari and daniel bonafoux. around this time, he conceived of himself as messiah son of joseph (though he later retracted and even denied the claim). in , he was expelled from smyrna and moved to a series of neighboring cities: bursa, istanbul, and gallipoli (gelibolu). he claimed to have received, during a sojourn in neighboring rodosto (tekirdag), epistles from shabbtai's widow yokheved (a.k.a. ""esther"", ""mikhal"", post-apostasy aisha) wherein she proposed marriage to him since he was then the leader of the believers (ma'aminim). when mass apostasy occurred among the jewish community in salonika (thessaloniki, greece), he polemicized in writing against the\xanewly formed donmeh\xasect. he also dissented from nathan of gaza's system of shabbatean kabbalah, preferring instead his own paradoxical theology, which generated controversy. he indited his masterwork boker avraham, a bipartite kabbalistic tract reinterpreting monotheism;

nevertheless, the manuscript was burned as heretical in accordance with the views of learned rabbis in smyrna (izmir, turkey). in , he was embroiled in conflict with\xatzvi hirsch ashkenazi, chief rabbi of the ashkenazic community in amsterdam, regarding the heretical writings (including\xaoz l'elohim) of shabbatean kabbalist nehemiah hiyya hayyun, a newcomer to the city who was welcomed by the sephardic community. nehemiah deemed solomon a crypto-shabbatean, although in amsterdam solomon had acted cautiously in matters concerning the shabbateans. that same year, despite their condemnation as heretical by tzvi hirsch ashkenazi, nehemiah's writings were deemed benign kabbalistic works by solomon and his committee. the dispute engendered tension in amsterdam and generated controversy among other jewish communities, especially in italy. solomon laid charges against tzvi hirsch ashkenazi before the amsterdam magistrates and his opponent was compelled to depart the city, as was nehemiah. in , when nehemiah reappeared in amsterdam, solomon refused to receive him. his extant kabbalistic works evidence their shabbatean character; it is uncertain whether in his later years he abjured his shabbatean convictions. doubtless there is a pitiable aspect to shabbtai tzvi, who in all likelihood would today be diagnosed as bipolar (manic-depressive) or perhaps schizophrenic, a mentally ill and quixotic man whose delusions of grandeur were confirmed and encouraged by his entourage, whose members may have been true believers or may have had self-interested reasons for preserving the pretense. indeed, the movement's most imaginative kabbalists and scholarly theologians--abraham yakhini, nathan of gaza, abraham miguel cardozo, nehemiah hiyya hayyun--ultimately overshadow shabbtai tzvi and reduce him to the movement's figurehead, a preposterous pretender propped up by superiors. despite the support of his apostles, shabbtai tzvi, supposed savior of the jews, elected in the end to save himself. in the wake of his shocking apostasy, disheartened adherents repented their involvement in the mass hysteria and resumed their observance of normative judaism. revulsion and remorse prompted the majority of his disillusioned followers to efface all memory and expunge all mention of the pseudo-messiah and his movement. the believers had been stricken with fever but at last the delirium had passed. for a minority of shabbateans, however, the craze continued. the activities of the shabbatean groups were mainly centered in turkey, greece, italy, poland, and lithuania, where fervid leaders and purported prophets and claimants to the succession to shabbtai tzvi appeared. though there were many believers in other parts of the diaspora, such as morocco, yemen, and kurdistan, the largest of the shabbatean circles were based in the cities of salonika (thessaloniki, greece), smyrna (izmir, turkey), and neighboring istanbul. in and/or , some jewish families in salonika followed in the footsteps of the false messiah and converted to islam en masse, forming the core of the crypto-shabbatean donmeh\xasect, which later divided into three subsects. as time passed and the cohort of early leaders passed away, the shabbatean movement lost its momentum and was driven underground, a process expedited by the antinomianism and nihilism of barukhiah russo and his radicals. the slogan of the extremists, ""the nullification of the torah is its true fulfillment,"" represented an anti-rabbinic and anti-halakhic revolt in judaism. in this and in other ways, the shabbatean movement was the jesus movement redivivus and redux, and it is small wonder that for many jews shabbateanism became a gateway to christianity. in the th century, the shabbatean spirit endured in both moderate and extreme forms. the moderate form found expression within the circles of hasidim in poland, especially in podolia (southwestern ukraine), which emerged prior to hasidism proper. these prototypical hasidim practiced a type of pious asceticism that featured a salient element of shabbateanism. the extreme form manifested itself in frankism, a semi-jewish/semi-christian religion, and frankists gradually evolved from feigned to authentic catholics. the founder of\xahasidism, israel ben eliezer (ba'al shem tov/besht), was reportedly so distraught by the mass conversion of the frankists to catholicism that he suffered a depression from which he never fully recovered. unlike shabbateanism, frankism had no lasting impact on judaism. the frankists lasted until around , by which time they had been absorbed into mainstream christianity, whereas by the late th century , donmeh remained, primarily in istanbul, izmir, and neighboring adrianople (edirne). the paradox of kabbalah is that it springs from creativity but can eventuate in destruction: historically, kabbalah study and practice has evidenced a tendency to engender antinomianism, nihilism, heresy, sectarianism, dissimulation, charlatanism, copycatism, apostasy, and conversion to christianity or islam. for this reason, ashkenazic rabbis erected fences around kabbalah, striving to circumscribe its study to mature and grounded initiates anchored to the propaedeutics of torah and talmud and moored to the realities of this world. for world jewry, modernity arose in the aftermath of shabbateanism. jews learned to recognize and to appreciate kabbalah for what it is: mystical speculation--benign in theory, parlous in praxis. while theoretical mysticism demonstrates the ingenuity of the human imagination, applied mysticism engenders subversion, transgression, and division. if there is a moral to glean from the melodramatic saga and tragic debacle of shabbateanism, perhaps it is that messiahship is best declared never by messiah but only by others, never in the present but only in hindsight. or, as the insightful and farsighted rabban yohanan ben zakkai advised: ""if you're holding a sapling in your hand and someone tells you, 'come quickly, messiah is here!', first finish planting the tree and then go to greet messiah.""

nevertheless, the manuscript was burned as heretical in accordance with the views of learned rabbis in smyrna (izmir, turkey). in , he was embroiled in conflict with\xatzvi hirsch ashkenazi, chief rabbi of the ashkenazic community in amsterdam, regarding the heretical writings (including\xaoz l'elohim) of shabbatean kabbalist nehemiah hiyya hayyun, a newcomer to the city who was welcomed by the sephardic community. nehemiah deemed solomon a crypto-shabbatean, although in amsterdam solomon had acted cautiously in matters concerning the shabbateans. that same year, despite their condemnation as heretical by tzvi hirsch ashkenazi, nehemiah's writings were deemed benign kabbalistic works by solomon and his committee. the dispute engendered tension in amsterdam and generated controversy among other jewish communities, especially in italy. solomon laid charges against tzvi hirsch ashkenazi before the amsterdam magistrates and his opponent was compelled to depart the city, as was nehemiah. in , when nehemiah reappeared in amsterdam, solomon refused to receive him. his extant kabbalistic works evidence their shabbatean character; it is uncertain whether in his later years he abjured his shabbatean convictions. doubtless there is a pitiable aspect to shabbtai tzvi, who in all likelihood would today be diagnosed as bipolar (manic-depressive) or perhaps schizophrenic, a mentally ill and quixotic man whose delusions of grandeur were confirmed and encouraged by his entourage, whose members may have been true believers or may have had self-interested reasons for preserving the pretense. indeed, the movement's most imaginative kabbalists and scholarly theologians--abraham yakhini, nathan of gaza, abraham miguel cardozo, nehemiah hiyya hayyun--ultimately overshadow shabbtai tzvi and reduce him to the movement's figurehead, a preposterous pretender propped up by superiors. despite the support of his apostles, shabbtai tzvi, supposed savior of the jews, elected in the end to save himself. in the wake of his shocking apostasy, disheartened adherents repented their involvement in the mass hysteria and resumed their observance of normative judaism. revulsion and remorse prompted the majority of his disillusioned followers to efface all memory and expunge all mention of the pseudo-messiah and his movement. the believers had been stricken with fever but at last the delirium had passed. for a minority of shabbateans, however, the craze continued. the activities of the shabbatean groups were mainly centered in turkey, greece, italy, poland, and lithuania, where fervid leaders and purported prophets and claimants to the succession to shabbtai tzvi appeared. though there were many believers in other parts of the diaspora, such as morocco, yemen, and kurdistan, the largest of the shabbatean circles were based in the cities of salonika (thessaloniki, greece), smyrna (izmir, turkey), and neighboring istanbul. in and/or , some jewish families in salonika followed in the footsteps of the false messiah and converted to islam en masse, forming the core of the crypto-shabbatean donmeh\xasect, which later divided into three subsects. as time passed and the cohort of early leaders passed away, the shabbatean movement lost its momentum and was driven underground, a process expedited by the antinomianism and nihilism of barukhiah russo and his radicals. the slogan of the extremists, ""the nullification of the torah is its true fulfillment,"" represented an anti-rabbinic and anti-halakhic revolt in judaism. in this and in other ways, the shabbatean movement was the jesus movement redivivus and redux, and it is small wonder that for many jews shabbateanism became a gateway to christianity. in the th century, the shabbatean spirit endured in both moderate and extreme forms. the moderate form found expression within the circles of hasidim in poland, especially in podolia (southwestern ukraine), which emerged prior to hasidism proper. these prototypical hasidim practiced a type of pious asceticism that featured a salient element of shabbateanism. the extreme form manifested itself in frankism, a semi-jewish/semi-christian religion, and frankists gradually evolved from feigned to authentic catholics. the founder of\xahasidism, israel ben eliezer (ba'al shem tov/besht), was reportedly so distraught by the mass conversion of the frankists to catholicism that he suffered a depression from which he never fully recovered. unlike shabbateanism, frankism had no lasting impact on judaism. the frankists lasted until around , by which time they had been absorbed into mainstream christianity, whereas by the late th century , donmeh remained, primarily in istanbul, izmir, and neighboring adrianople (edirne). the paradox of kabbalah is that it springs from creativity but can eventuate in destruction: historically, kabbalah study and practice has evidenced a tendency to engender antinomianism, nihilism, heresy, sectarianism, dissimulation, charlatanism, copycatism, apostasy, and conversion to christianity or islam. for this reason, ashkenazic rabbis erected fences around kabbalah, striving to circumscribe its study to mature and grounded initiates anchored to the propaedeutics of torah and talmud and moored to the realities of this world. for world jewry, modernity arose in the aftermath of shabbateanism. jews learned to recognize and to appreciate kabbalah for what it is: mystical speculation--benign in theory, parlous in praxis. while theoretical mysticism demonstrates the ingenuity of the human imagination, applied mysticism engenders subversion, transgression, and division. if there is a moral to glean from the melodramatic saga and tragic debacle of shabbateanism, perhaps it is that messiahship is best declared never by messiah but only by others, never in the present but only in hindsight. or, as the insightful and farsighted rabban yohanan ben zakkai advised: ""if you're holding a sapling in your hand and someone tells you, 'come quickly, messiah is here!', first finish planting the tree and then go to greet messiah."" (avot d'rabbi natan b) the chmielnicki massacres, which became known as the evil decrees of - (gzeirot tah v'tat), were construed as the cataclysmic events--the birth pangs of messiah (hevlei moshiah)--traditionally believed to usher in the messianic era. in their uprisings against catholic polish feudalism, the cossacks (orthodox christian ruthenians)--and their tatar turkish allies from crimea--slew tens of thousands of jews in a prolonged pogrom: fatality estimates vary widely from , to ,. understandably, the tragedy and trauma of these tumultuous events intensified jewish yearnings for deliverance and expectations of impending redemption. yet while the pogroms were an immediate and important impetus, they were localized in eastern europe and alone cannot account for the meteoric rise of shabbateanism throughout world jewry. \t\t in judaism, after isaac luria (haari/arizal) innovated a speculative and abstruse kabbalistic system, messianism permeated mysticism, and belief in the imminent advent of messiah was prevalent among the sages and the laity alike. by the first half of the th century, the dissemination of lurianic kabbalah, at least among kabbalists and rabbis, had cultivated favorable conditions for the expression of messianic impulses and aspirations. the zohar, lurianic kabbalah, christian millenarianism (chiliasm), and the chmielnicki massacres all combined to foster revolution and foment mania. among the jewish laity tens of thousands became true believers and bandwagoners, ardent adherents swept up in the surging waves of messianic enthusiasm and the momentum of a mass movement whose time had come. with the advent of shabbtai tzvi--and his scattered cadre of apostles--jews were divided into believers (ma'aminim) and infidels (koferim); as the frenzy intensified, tensions and suspicions proliferated, splitting communities and families. what follows is a survey of key shabbateans of the early modern period: a native of smyrna (izmir, turkey), moses pinheiro (c. - ce) studied talmud and kabbalah as a youth with his fellow student shabbtai tzvi. there is no indication that he supported shabbtai's original messianic claim in . around , he migrated to\xaleghorn (livorno, italy), where he became a highly respected scholar. when news of the shabbatean movement reached italy, he became one of its most passionate spokesmen and continued to believe in shabbtai's messiahship long after his\xaapostasy. in , as a delegate of leghorn's jewish community, he visited shabbtai at the height of the excitement, but reached smyrna only post-apostasy. there his faith was bolstered by communications he received from both shabbtai and\xanathan\xaof gaza. in , he returned to italy with a delegation from three other communities. in , he hosted nathan at his house during the latter's visit to italy. moses stood at the center of the shabbateans in leghorn and corresponded with shabbtai over the years. in , he was still considered a believer; when and whether he finally renounced his belief remains uncertain. his daughter was the mother of the well-known kabbalist and rabbi,\xajoseph ergas, who kept silent about his grandfather's shabbatean connections. he was lauded for his piety and asceticism by ergas' disciple,\xamalakhi hakohen\xaof leghorn. several of his recollections of shabbtai are extant. his disciples included abraham miguel cardozo. advertisement abraham miguel cardozo (- ce), a native of rio seco (spain), was born into a family of portuguese conversos from celorico da beira (portugal). he and his older brother fernando isaac studied medicine at university of salamanca (in addition, he studied christian theology); while his brother was studious, abraham was inclined to serenade ladies from beneath their balconies. he completed his training nevertheless and lived for a time with his brother in neighboring madrid. in , he migrated to italy, where he settled first in venice (and became a disciple of moses zacuto) then in neighboring leghorn (livorno). in italy he reverted formally to his ancestral faith of judaism, either in venice or in leghorn, where he established himself as a physician and studied kabbalah under moses pinheiro. he migrated to egypt, where he settled in and around cairo for five years and studied lurianic kabbalah (and may have first met shabbtai tzvi). in /, he migrated to tripoli (libya) and lived there for about a decade. once prosperous--thanks to the recommendation by the grand duke of tuscany to othman, the bey of tripoli--he married two wives. in , with the advent of shabbateanism, he assumed the mantle of a prophet and claimed to have experienced revelations by means of dreams and visions. he dispatched circulars in support of shabbtai and justified the latter's apostasy on the grounds that messiah needed to be counted among sinners to atone for israel's sins (although he opposed the apostasy of other shabbateans, as well as religious antinomianism in general). abraham averred that opposition to shabbtai was necessary so that belief in him would constitute a leap of faith. in , he wrote that the ottoman authorities refrained from executing shabbtai to avoid making a martyr of him and engendering a new religion. that same year, he was accused by the rabbinate of smyrna (izmir, turkey) of being remiss in his religious observance, but was defended in writing by the religious judges (dayyanim) on the rabbinical court (beit din) of tripoli. he corresponded with other leaders of the movement, including nathan of gaza, abraham yakhini, and later heschel tzoref, as well as with shabbtai himself. in , he sent his theological tract boker avraham to shabbtai, but garnered no response. that same year, after intensively propagating shabbateanism, he was banned from tripoli. he migrated to tunis (tunisia), where he became physician to the local ruler and remained for nearly two years. he was additionally excommunicated by the rabbinates of smyrna and venice. in , he returned to leghorn, but the local council soon demanded his isolation from the community. in , he returned to smyrna, where he attracted many disciples among the local shabbateans, including elijah hakohen haitamari and daniel bonafoux. around this time, he conceived of himself as messiah son of joseph (though he later retracted and even denied the claim). in , he was expelled from smyrna and moved to a series of neighboring cities: bursa, istanbul, and gallipoli (gelibolu). he claimed to have received, during a sojourn in neighboring rodosto (tekirdag), epistles from shabbtai's widow yokheved (a.k.a.

nevertheless, the manuscript was burned as heretical in accordance with the views of learned rabbis in smyrna (izmir, turkey). in , he was embroiled in conflict with\xatzvi hirsch ashkenazi, chief rabbi of the ashkenazic community in amsterdam, regarding the heretical writings (including\xaoz l'elohim) of shabbatean kabbalist nehemiah hiyya hayyun, a newcomer to the city who was welcomed by the sephardic community. nehemiah deemed solomon a crypto-shabbatean, although in amsterdam solomon had acted cautiously in matters concerning the shabbateans. that same year, despite their condemnation as heretical by tzvi hirsch ashkenazi, nehemiah's writings were deemed benign kabbalistic works by solomon and his committee. the dispute engendered tension in amsterdam and generated controversy among other jewish communities, especially in italy. solomon laid charges against tzvi hirsch ashkenazi before the amsterdam magistrates and his opponent was compelled to depart the city, as was nehemiah. in , when nehemiah reappeared in amsterdam, solomon refused to receive him. his extant kabbalistic works evidence their shabbatean character; it is uncertain whether in his later years he abjured his shabbatean convictions. doubtless there is a pitiable aspect to shabbtai tzvi, who in all likelihood would today be diagnosed as bipolar (manic-depressive) or perhaps schizophrenic, a mentally ill and quixotic man whose delusions of grandeur were confirmed and encouraged by his entourage, whose members may have been true believers or may have had self-interested reasons for preserving the pretense. indeed, the movement's most imaginative kabbalists and scholarly theologians--abraham yakhini, nathan of gaza, abraham miguel cardozo, nehemiah hiyya hayyun--ultimately overshadow shabbtai tzvi and reduce him to the movement's figurehead, a preposterous pretender propped up by superiors. despite the support of his apostles, shabbtai tzvi, supposed savior of the jews, elected in the end to save himself. in the wake of his shocking apostasy, disheartened adherents repented their involvement in the mass hysteria and resumed their observance of normative judaism. revulsion and remorse prompted the majority of his disillusioned followers to efface all memory and expunge all mention of the pseudo-messiah and his movement. the believers had been stricken with fever but at last the delirium had passed. for a minority of shabbateans, however, the craze continued. the activities of the shabbatean groups were mainly centered in turkey, greece, italy, poland, and lithuania, where fervid leaders and purported prophets and claimants to the succession to shabbtai tzvi appeared. though there were many believers in other parts of the diaspora, such as morocco, yemen, and kurdistan, the largest of the shabbatean circles were based in the cities of salonika (thessaloniki, greece), smyrna (izmir, turkey), and neighboring istanbul. in and/or , some jewish families in salonika followed in the footsteps of the false messiah and converted to islam en masse, forming the core of the crypto-shabbatean donmeh\xasect, which later divided into three subsects. as time passed and the cohort of early leaders passed away, the shabbatean movement lost its momentum and was driven underground, a process expedited by the antinomianism and nihilism of barukhiah russo and his radicals. the slogan of the extremists, ""the nullification of the torah is its true fulfillment,"" represented an anti-rabbinic and anti-halakhic revolt in judaism. in this and in other ways, the shabbatean movement was the jesus movement redivivus and redux, and it is small wonder that for many jews shabbateanism became a gateway to christianity. in the th century, the shabbatean spirit endured in both moderate and extreme forms. the moderate form found expression within the circles of hasidim in poland, especially in podolia (southwestern ukraine), which emerged prior to hasidism proper. these prototypical hasidim practiced a type of pious asceticism that featured a salient element of shabbateanism. the extreme form manifested itself in frankism, a semi-jewish/semi-christian religion, and frankists gradually evolved from feigned to authentic catholics. the founder of\xahasidism, israel ben eliezer (ba'al shem tov/besht), was reportedly so distraught by the mass conversion of the frankists to catholicism that he suffered a depression from which he never fully recovered. unlike shabbateanism, frankism had no lasting impact on judaism. the frankists lasted until around , by which time they had been absorbed into mainstream christianity, whereas by the late th century , donmeh remained, primarily in istanbul, izmir, and neighboring adrianople (edirne). the paradox of kabbalah is that it springs from creativity but can eventuate in destruction: historically, kabbalah study and practice has evidenced a tendency to engender antinomianism, nihilism, heresy, sectarianism, dissimulation, charlatanism, copycatism, apostasy, and conversion to christianity or islam. for this reason, ashkenazic rabbis erected fences around kabbalah, striving to circumscribe its study to mature and grounded initiates anchored to the propaedeutics of torah and talmud and moored to the realities of this world. for world jewry, modernity arose in the aftermath of shabbateanism. jews learned to recognize and to appreciate kabbalah for what it is: mystical speculation--benign in theory, parlous in praxis. while theoretical mysticism demonstrates the ingenuity of the human imagination, applied mysticism engenders subversion, transgression, and division. if there is a moral to glean from the melodramatic saga and tragic debacle of shabbateanism, perhaps it is that messiahship is best declared never by messiah but only by others, never in the present but only in hindsight. or, as the insightful and farsighted rabban yohanan ben zakkai advised: ""if you're holding a sapling in your hand and someone tells you, 'come quickly, messiah is here!', first finish planting the tree and then go to greet messiah."" (avot d'rabbi natan b) the zohar, lurianic kabbalah, christian millenarianism (chiliasm), and the chmielnicki massacres all combined to foster revolution and foment mania. among the jewish laity tens of thousands became true believers and bandwagoners, ardent adherents swept up in the surging waves of messianic enthusiasm and the momentum of a mass movement whose time had come. with the advent of shabbtai tzvi--and his scattered cadre of apostles--jews were divided into believers (ma'aminim) and infidels (koferim); as the frenzy intensified, tensions and suspicions proliferated, splitting communities and families. what follows is a survey of key shabbateans of the early modern period: a native of smyrna (izmir, turkey), moses pinheiro (c. - ce) studied talmud and kabbalah as a youth with his fellow student shabbtai tzvi. there is no indication that he supported shabbtai's original messianic claim in . around , he migrated to\xaleghorn (livorno, italy), where he became a highly respected scholar. when news of the shabbatean movement reached italy, he became one of its most passionate spokesmen and continued to believe in shabbtai's messiahship long after his\xaapostasy. in , as a delegate of leghorn's jewish community, he visited shabbtai at the height of the excitement, but reached smyrna only post-apostasy. there his faith was bolstered by communications he received from both shabbtai and\xanathan\xaof gaza. in , he returned to italy with a delegation from three other communities. in , he hosted nathan at his house during the latter's visit to italy. moses stood at the center of the shabbateans in leghorn and corresponded with shabbtai over the years. in , he was still considered a believer; when and whether he finally renounced his belief remains uncertain. his daughter was the mother of the well-known kabbalist and rabbi,\xajoseph ergas, who kept silent about his grandfather's shabbatean connections. he was lauded for his piety and asceticism by ergas' disciple,\xamalakhi hakohen\xaof leghorn. several of his recollections of shabbtai are extant. his disciples included abraham miguel cardozo. advertisement abraham miguel cardozo (- ce), a native of rio seco (spain), was born into a family of portuguese conversos from celorico da beira (portugal). he and his older brother fernando isaac studied medicine at university of salamanca (in addition, he studied christian theology); while his brother was studious, abraham was inclined to serenade ladies from beneath their balconies. he completed his training nevertheless and lived for a time with his brother in neighboring madrid. in , he migrated to italy, where he settled first in venice (and became a disciple of moses zacuto) then in neighboring leghorn (livorno). in italy he reverted formally to his ancestral faith of judaism, either in venice or in leghorn, where he established himself as a physician and studied kabbalah under moses pinheiro. he migrated to egypt, where he settled in and around cairo for five years and studied lurianic kabbalah (and may have first met shabbtai tzvi). in /, he migrated to tripoli (libya) and lived there for about a decade. once prosperous--thanks to the recommendation by the grand duke of tuscany to othman, the bey of tripoli--he married two wives. in , with the advent of shabbateanism, he assumed the mantle of a prophet and claimed to have experienced revelations by means of dreams and visions. he dispatched circulars in support of shabbtai and justified the latter's apostasy on the grounds that messiah needed to be counted among sinners to atone for israel's sins (although he opposed the apostasy of other shabbateans, as well as religious antinomianism in general). abraham averred that opposition to shabbtai was necessary so that belief in him would constitute a leap of faith. in , he wrote that the ottoman authorities refrained from executing shabbtai to avoid making a martyr of him and engendering a new religion. that same year, he was accused by the rabbinate of smyrna (izmir, turkey) of being remiss in his religious observance, but was defended in writing by the religious judges (dayyanim) on the rabbinical court (beit din) of tripoli. he corresponded with other leaders of the movement, including nathan of gaza, abraham yakhini, and later heschel tzoref, as well as with shabbtai himself. in , he sent his theological tract boker avraham to shabbtai, but garnered no response. that same year, after intensively propagating shabbateanism, he was banned from tripoli. he migrated to tunis (tunisia), where he became physician to the local ruler and remained for nearly two years. he was additionally excommunicated by the rabbinates of smyrna and venice. in , he returned to leghorn, but the local council soon demanded his isolation from the community. in , he returned to smyrna, where he attracted many disciples among the local shabbateans, including elijah hakohen haitamari and daniel bonafoux. around this time, he conceived of himself as messiah son of joseph (though he later retracted and even denied the claim). in , he was expelled from smyrna and moved to a series of neighboring cities: bursa, istanbul, and gallipoli (gelibolu). he claimed to have received, during a sojourn in neighboring rodosto (tekirdag), epistles from shabbtai's widow yokheved (a.k.a.

"the unofficial guide to official washington. the unofficial guide to official washington. loading you are already subscribed something went wrong by eugene daniels, rachael bade and ryan lizza // : am edt presented by with help from eli okun and garrett ross a pair of fresh stories out this morning illuminate two emerging storylines in the early jockeying for the campaign ... on the democratic side: white house aides tell us that president joe biden is likely to announce a final decision on the reelection in the coming weeks. and as he gears up for a likely reelection, he appears to be shimmying back to the ideological middle (an easy move when there's no real primary challenge). there are three issues in particular where this inching toward the center has been clearest in recent weeks, our jonathan lemire and daniella diaz write, and where biden's recent posturing has ticked off some of his most progressive supporters: in each of those areas, the biden administration has taken positions that are at odds with some of the loudest and most influential voices in his coalition (and which seem to make it much harder to follow through on some of his campaign promises). and jonathan and daniella's story is chock full of quotes from crestfallen progressives who were singing biden's praises not that long ago. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.): ""i think the devil is in the details and we will see what happens. ... but has he made decisions that progressives disagree with? absolutely. we will see what comes up in the next year."" rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.): ""if the president supports d.c. statehood, he should govern like it."" biden aides are quick to emphasize that there's no ""coordinated, deliberate strategy to move to the center,"" as they told our colleagues. but it's hard to ignore what our colleagues call the ""emerging gulf between the president and his progressive base,"" as it ""provides a window into how biden world views the looming presidential campaign."" on the republican side: our olivia beavers spoke with (nearly) every republican of the florida congressional delegation to see which florida man they plan on supporting in the gop primary: former president donald trump or gov. ron desantis, who has yet to officially announce a bid. the members are torn over what to do. they fear trump's wrath, worry about retaliation against those he sees as disloyal and fret about the long-term need to get closer to desantis, who is three decades younger than trump and has a much longer runway ahead of him. conversations with nearly every member ""point to clear future fractures over which candidate to support. and decision time is quickly approaching, as early polling shows the party primary trending towards a two-way battle between the two floridians,"" olivia writes. rep. neal dunn: ""oh, wow. you really are trying to get me into a situation here."" (dunn added that while he had ""pretty much"" made up his mind on who he'd endorse, he plans to keep it secret for now, because ""i don't need to make myself a target for a year."") rep. aaron bean likened it to ""sophie's choice."" rep. paulina luna: ""who am i supporting, gov. desantis or trump? trump. i love desantis. i don't think anyone will ever be able to compete with him as governor, and i'll be sad to see if he leaves early. ... i love them both."" and one anonymous florida republican said this in response to olivia's query: ""do you think i want to talk about that? you think i'm crazy?"" happy st. patrick's day. thanks for reading playbook. drop us a line: rachael bade, eugene daniels, ryan lizza. a message from amazon: nearly two-thirds of college students in the u.s. say they struggle with the cost of their education. that's why amazon offers prepaid and fully-funded tuition to nearly million employees and delivery partners.

""cry me an atmospheric river,"" one of \'s best song titles, imagines the earth\'s climate system as an apex predator that has no pity for the ones who turned up the thermostat. ""i will always be here, heating and cooling / it doesn't matter to me what happens to the humans,"" arm sneers against a maelstrom of mutoid psych rock. ""cascades of crap,"" another great title, follows a similar unsubtle but effective tack. there\'s also ""here comes the flood,"" which lampoons anti-vaxxers and ivermectin users,\xawhile ""human stock capital"" aims its darts at the ugly gig economy many of us are stuck in. the album does have a couple sweet moments too: ""paul herman\'s hermits"" is an ode to pere ubu\'s on-again-off-again guitarist, and the album ends with ""little dogs,"" a tribute to arm\'s pomeranian, russell. (""sure they get wound up, but they're easy to distract / just pick 'em up or give 'em a tasty tiny snack""). plastic eternity may not be as essential as superfuzz bigmuff or every good boy deserves fudge, but it\'s always good to have them back. as arm puts it, ""some people have poker night or whatever the fuck, and they have the excuse to get together with their friends. for us, mudhoney is that. this is what we do."" may they never stop. -- public interest - spiritual pollution (erste theke tontraeger)chris natividad of marbled eye offers off up a bleak vision on his second public interest album -- james holden - imagine this is a high dimensional space of all possibilities (border community)a work of hallucinatory post-rave beauty from this veteran uk producer -- marta and tricky - when it\'s going wrong (false idols)tricky vocalist goes solo...sort of -- erlend oye - winter companion (bubbles records)the kings of convenience co-founder\'s quickly recorded ep is highlighted by a cover of glen campbell\'s ""wichita lineman"" ""it\'s been a dream for me to release songs that i have written while they are still fresh out of the oven,""\xaerlend oye of kings of convenience, a duo known for taking their time with their records, getting every note and detail right.\xahis new solo ep proudly states\xaon the cover that it was\xa""recorded in mexico city january "" and two of the songs were written then as well. the dashed off nature of this ep is felt -- it\'s pretty slight but nonetheless fun. the first two songs are\xaspider and sharks that could almost be children\'s songs, while the best two tracks are covers: jimmy webb/glen campbell\'s ""wichita lineman"" which he pronounces ""witchie-tah"" and the moore brothers\' affecting ""new for you."" i appreciate\xaoye\'s usual tendency to sweat the small stuff, but it\'s also great to hear him just put\xasongs out in the world like this. and check out what\'s new in our shop. --'}",jonathan tah,en,2023-04-07T14:12:31Z
" ""after kicking off espn's college football future power rankings with quarterbacks, the series switches to the other side of the ball with the defenses. georgia and other recent national champions will appear below, but so will several teams that have yet to reach the college football playoff and might struggle to ever take that leap. iowa, for example, has become a mainstay on this list because of a historically opportunistic defense (offsetting a historically inept offense), but the hawkeyes' best cfp finish was no. in . programs such as utah, nc state and san diego state have risen in their respective conferences because of their strength on defense. the biggest challenge here was assessing the lost production for perennial top defenses and how much, if at all, they will fall off. as a reminder, these rankings cover the top defenses during the next three seasons -- , and -- and examine both current rosters and future recruiting. coaching and consistency also factor into which teams make the cut. here's a look at last year's future power rankings for defense. now, for the latest rundown. future defense power ranking: scouting the bulldogs: one of the major curiosities entering last season was how georgia's defense would fare after losing a record five nfl first-round draft picks, several other notable players and coordinator dan lanning. the unit wasn't quite as dominant but barely dropped off in helping the team to its second straight national title. the bulldogs led the nation in rushing defense, ranked second in third-down efficiency and fifth in points allowed. they don't lose as much star power this season, although jalen carter is irreplaceable in the middle of the line, and standouts such as linebacker nolan smith and defensive backs christopher smith and kelee ringo also exit athens. georgia looks loaded at positions such as inside linebacker and safety. smael mondon and jamon dumas-johnson combined for tackles, including for loss (four sacks by dumas-johnson). free safety malaki starks and star javon bullard help anchor a secondary that also brings back starting cornerback kamari lassiter. carter leaves a massive void, but georgia's overall line depth is strong with sacks leader mykel williams as well as veterans nazir stackhouse, tramel walthour and warren brinson. there's some turnover at outside linebacker, but sophomore chaz chambliss is expected to emerge alongside second-year jalon walker, who also has worked inside. georgia also has overtaken clemson as the nation's premier defensive recruiting operation. the team's six highest-rated recruits for play defense, headlined by linebacker raylen wilson (espn's no. overall recruit) and safety joenel aguero (espn's no. overall). georgia also has commitments from four defensive recruits ranked in espn's top nationally, led by cornerback ellis robinson iv (no. overall). future defense power ranking: scouting the tigers: despite a step back last fall, clemson projects well through . coordinator wes goodwin is no longer new, but the unit loses several mainstays, including linemen myles murphy, bryan bresee and k.j. henry, and linebacker trenton simpson. but clemson retained more production than some expected, as linemen tyler davis, xavier thomas and ruke orhorhoro are all back for their fifth or sixth seasons. davis is a three-time all-acc selection who earned all-america honors in , while thomas and orhorhoro both have earned third-team all-acc honors. senior end justin mascoll is another veteran presence. the key is building for and with junior tackles payton page and tre williams, among others. clemson adds peter woods, espn's top defensive tackle and no. overall recruit for the class, as well as four other espn line recruits. linebacker also looks strong with jeremiah trotter jr., a second-team ap all-america selection, leading the group alongside barrett carter, who earned first-team all-acc honors. the two combined for sacks and tackles for loss in . sophomore wade woodaz emerged last season and will take on an even bigger role, especially in . clemson will look to second-year players t.j. dudley and kobe mccloud to provide more depth. injuries hit clemson's secondary hard in , but there were some bright spots, such as safety jalyn phillips, who returns for his final year, and cornerbacks sheridan jones and nate wiggins. toriano pride jr. and jeadyn lukus, both sophomores, help the cornerback outlook beyond . safety andrew mukuba, the acc defensive rookie of the year in , will try to rebound from a disappointing season. clemson has nice depth at safety with senior r.j. mickens. the team also has two espn recruits committed for . future defense power rankings: scouting the wolverines: after a surprise breakthrough in , the entire michigan program showed it had staying power last fall, but especially the defense. the unit lost nfl first-round draft picks aidan hutchinson and daxton hill and second-round pick david ojabo, as well as coordinator mike macdonald. but michigan once again finished in the top in many categories, and it transitioned well from macdonald to jesse minter, a broyles award finalist who is back. key returning players include safety rod moore, lineman kris jenkins, linebackers junior colson and michael barrett, and cornerback will johnson, who blossomed late in his freshman year and will play at least two more seasons. defensive lineman mason graham is another key returnee who will play at least through . sophomore cornerback amorion walker drew strong reviews during spring practice and adds to a playmaking secondary that features moore, johnson, senior nickel mike sainristil, senior safety makari paige and others. future defense power ranking: scouting the tide: some might be surprised to see the tide not drop in these rankings, given the angst around their defense at times last season and the departures of star pass-rusher will anderson jr., safety brian branch, coordinator pete golding and others. but alabama has a chance to reestablish its dominance on defense, thanks to exceptional recruiting in and the return of veteran playcaller kevin steele to tuscaloosa. plus, the tide actually held up well last season, finishing ninth nationally in points allowed and th in yards allowed. let's start with who returns: alabama has several proven standouts in junior cornerback kool-aid mckinstry (team-high pass breakups in ) and linebacker dallas turner, who has . sacks and tackles for loss the past two seasons. if turner recaptures his form and boosts the pass rush along with others, including senior chris braswell, alabama should be in good shape for the short term. future defense power ranking: scouting the hawkeyes: there's temptation to move iowa even higher, especially after an exceptional season that helped offset a woeful offense in . the hawkeyes finished second nationally in both points allowed and yards allowed, and fourth in pass efficiency defense. phil parker, entering his th season as coordinator, is arguably the nation's top playcaller and defensive architect. but parker will be challenged to reload after iowa lost several standouts, including first-team all-america linebacker jack campbell, all-big ten defensive backs kaevon merriweather and riley moss, emerging pass-rusher lukas van ness and linebackers seth benson and jestin jacobs. iowa needs a new group to carry the torch, such as ends deontae craig and joe evans, a group of veteran interior linemen headlined by logan lee, first-team all-big ten cornerback cooper dejean and emerging young safety xavier nwankpa, an espn four-star recruit in . iowa's overall depth in the secondary actually might improve this fall as seniors quinn schulte and sebastian castro join nwankpa at safety, and dejean forms a solid cornerback tandem with jermari harris, who missed all of last season with injuries after recording four interceptions in . the hawkeyes also have plenty of options up front, even behind craig and evans at end with junior ethan hurkett. linebacker is by far the biggest short-term question, as iowa must build around senior jay higgins, who had tackles last season. the team added productive virginia transfer nick jackson. iowa's recruiting rarely pops nationally, but linebacker ben kueter, a four-time state wrestling champion, headlines the class. the team also has commitments from espn preston ries and four-star cam buffington. future defense power ranking: scouting the nittany lions: penn state is set up to push for its first big ten championship since , and much of the optimism around happy valley stems from who returns on defense. coordinator manny diaz had a solid first season and is back despite generating some interest for head-coaching vacancies. diaz's aggressive scheme suits returning players such as ends chop robinson and adisa isaac, and linebacker abdul carter, a national awards candidate who recorded . sacks, . tackles for loss and two forced fumbles as a true freshman. carter will help lead the defense through at least , and robinson is a true junior. linebacker u has an excellent opportunity to uphold its tradition with carter, curtis jacobs and kobe king, who are all experienced and boast multiple years of eligibility left. penn state actually has no seniors in its linebacker room and will lean on players such as junior tyler elsdon, who finished fourth on the team with tackles last season. scouting the tigers: lsu's defense is in a good spot after a solid but not spectacular season under a new coaching staff. the unit brings back star power, especially with linebacker harold perkins jr. for at least two more seasons. but there are some holes to fill, especially in the secondary and up front, as b.j. ojulari moves on to the nfl. the return of dynamic defensive tackle maason smith, injured while celebrating during the opener, helps a line that loses both ojulari and end ali gaye. smith and mekhi wingo, a third-team ap all-america selection who had three sacks and six tackles for loss, give the tigers two interior stalwarts, both with multiple years of eligibility left. junior end sai'vion jones could see a bigger role after finishing third on the team in sacks (.) last fall. jacobian guillory and arizona transfer paris shand provide depth inside. ovie oghoufo, a texas transfer with career sacks, should help fill the pass-rushing gap. future defense power ranking: future defense power ranking: scouting the badgers: a jarring season for wisconsin ended with luke fickell as head coach and defensive coordinator jim leonhard no longer with the team. fickell's arrival brought sweeping changes, but less so for a defense that has been on a strong trajectory. although the defense slipped a bit in , it still finished th nationally in points allowed and th in yards per play allowed. fickell's roots on defense run deep, and coordinator mike tressel has spent most of his career in the big ten at michigan state. they inherit a unit that loses standouts in linebacker nick herbig and nose tackle keeanu benton, but returns strong overall production at linebacker, defensive end and elsewhere. inside linebackers maema njongmeta and jordan turner combined for tackles, including . sacks and . tackles for loss. senior c.j. goetz anchors the outside linebacker group after a productive season, and there's good depth with sophomore darryl peterson and junior kaden johnson. benton will be missed up front, but wisconsin returns veterans rodas johnson, james thompson jr. and isaiah mullens, who has career appearances. the group needs pass-rushers, though, and seemingly received a major jolt with temple transfer darian varner, who ranked th nationally in sacks per game last season. senior kamo'i latu will stabilize the safety spot as wisconsin tries to replace the opportunistic john torchio (six interceptions). junior hunter wohler and sophomore preston zachman add depth, and the badgers regain travian blaylock, a projected starter last spring, from an acl tear. cornerback alexander smith also is back from injury, and sophomore ricardo hallman stood out this spring after starting eight games in . wisconsin added versatile boston college transfer jason maitre. espn four-star recruit jace arnold also enters the mix. fickell and his assistants should not only elevate wisconsin's defensive recruiting but its ability to add key players from the portal. future defense power ranking: not ranked the secondary projects as the unit's strength, especially in the short term. leading tackler trey taylor, a second-team all-mountain west selection last season, is back at safety alongside camby goff and jayden goodwin. the three combined for seven interceptions and pass breakups in . veteran cornerback eian castonguay ( tackles last season) is also back with jamari bellamy. air force will lose a lot in , although zdroik, bellamy and others are expected to return. freshman defensive end jack curtis stood out during spring practice and could be pegged for a bigger role after this coming season. future defense power ranking: scouting the wolfpack: nc state's defense has reached a level where drop-offs should be limited despite key personnel turnover. the wolfpack will miss all-acc selections drake thomas (linebacker) and tanner ingle (safety), but coach dave doeren and veteran coordinator tony gibson have enough back to sustain momentum. linebacker payton wilson's return for a sixth season gives nc state a proven leader for the unit. wilson has career tackles, including . for loss and nine sacks, as well as four interceptions. he'll be joined by senior jaylon scott, junior devon betty and younger players such as caden fordham. nc state returns an experienced line led by junior davin vann, who tied with wilson for second on the team in sacks (.) last fall. both vann and junior tackle c.j. clark could play through , while senior end savion jackson has started parts of the past three seasons. nc state added end red hibbler, espn's no. junior college transfer, as well as cincinnati transfer noah potter for short-term depth. sophomore end travali price should continue to blossom. future defense power ranking: scouting the irish: despite some late struggles, notre dame's defense remained on the right path in . the challenge ahead for second-year coach marcus freeman and coordinator al golden is addressing key personnel losses up front, and ultimately taking the next step. notre dame returns an emerging superstar in sophomore cornerback benjamin morrison, who had six interceptions as a true freshman and will play at least through . the irish also have one of the nation's most seasoned linebacker groups, as seniors jd bertrand, jack kiser and marist liufau are all back after combining for tackles -- . for loss -- last season. sophomore jaylen sneed and others, including incoming freshman jaiden ausberry -- espn's no. overall recruit in -- should lead the group in and beyond. future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the illini: the illinois defense seemed to be trending well after , but few expected the spike that would follow last season. illinois led the nation in fewest points allowed and ranked in the top in all the major statistical categories. the unit produced all-america cornerback devon witherspoon and other standouts, and coordinator ryan walters was a broyles award finalist before taking the purdue head-coaching job. witherspoon and walters are both gone, alongside all-big ten defensive backs sydney brown and jartavius martin, who combined for nine interceptions and pass breakups. but illinois received a big boost up front when jer'zhan newton and keith randolph jr., who combined for sacks and tackles for loss, both returned for the season. the illini will need to build around them and prepare for , as players such as terah edwards and bryce barnes step into bigger roles. future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the gophers: every power rankings release has teams that should have been included in the previous version, including minnesota, which continues to be one of the most consistent defenses in college football. the gophers ranked fourth nationally in fewest points allowed last season and are th since . joe rossi is one of the nation's best emerging coordinators, and will return for his fifth season as playcaller and seventh overall. the gophers lose linebacker mariano sori-marin, safety jordan howden and other mainstays but bring back a nice core, especially with tyler nubin and justin walley both returning in the secondary. nubin, a second-team all-big ten selection, and walley combined for seven interceptions last season. they lead a secondary returning veteran safeties darius green and coleman bryson, and southeastern louisiana safety transfer jack henderson. but minnesota needs cornerback help opposite walley. young corners tariq watson and rhyland kelly have a big summer ahead. cody lindenberg moves into minnesota's lead linebacker role following sori-marin's departure, and he should headline the group through at least the season. the gophers added western michigan transfer ryan selig, who has career tackles ( for loss), but will rely on several young linebackers, including devon williams and joey gerlach. junior end danny striggow and senior tackle kyler baugh, both honorable-mention all-big ten selections in , anchor a defensive front that also includes veterans darnell jefferies and jah joyner, who should boost a lagging pass rush. the gophers also added transfer end chris collins, who appeared in games with north carolina. future defense power ranking: scouting the aggies: projecting texas a&m's overall outlook beyond isn't easy, given the disastrous results last season and what they could mean if coach jimbo fisher doesn't turn things around soon. but the aggies' defense still finished in the top nationally in points allowed, and it returns a sizable group of high-level recruits who could break out this coming season. texas a&m's historic defensive recruiting haul included linemen walter nolen, shemar stewart and lt overton. gabriel brownlow-dindy, another headliner of the class, should be a bigger factor as he comes off of a knee injury. the line also has veterans such as senior mckinnley jackson and juniors fadil diggs and shemar turner, so depth should be a strength. texas a&m lost several transfers in the back seven, including linebacker andre white jr. but senior chris russell jr. and junior edgerrin cooper are back to lead the linebackers. russell finished third on the team in tackles () and tied for second in tackles for loss (), while cooper led the team in tfls in . the aggies must improve at cornerback and hope north carolina transfer tony grimes will provide a lift alongside junior tyreek chappell and others. their safety tandem of fifth-year senior demani richardson and junior jardin gilbert provides production and system knowledge. richardson has career starts, tackles and four interceptions. the aggies didn't match with their recruiting class but still landed lineman david hicks, espn's no. overall prospect, decorated cornerback bravion rogers (espn no. ) and safety dalton brooks (no. overall). future defense power ranking: scouting the wildcats: kentucky fell well short of expectations last season, but the defense held up its end, finishing th nationally in yards allowed, th in points allowed and seventh against the pass. coach mark stoops and coordinator brad white have established a standard that should sustain through . the immediate concern is bolstering a linebacker group that loses mainstays deandre square and jordan wright, as well as all-sec safety keidron smith. senior inside linebacker d'eryk jackson will lead the linebacker group after recording a team-high tackles last season. kentucky also got a big boost with the return of j.j. weaver, a captain in who has made starts in each of the past three seasons. junior trevin wallace also is back after recording two interceptions and . tackles for loss last fall. wallace, sophomore keaten wade and others will be key beyond , including incoming freshmen jayvant brown and grant godfrey, both espn four-star recruits. sophomore tackle deone walker is a -foot-, -pound force who should anchor the line for at least two more seasons. kentucky needs more around him, especially at end, where sophomore khalil saunders, junior tre'vonn rybka and others will compete. jamarius dinkins is another intriguing interior lineman who should play several more seasons for uk, which added north carolina transfer keeshawn silver. like the line, kentucky's secondary is filled with promising non-seniors, including sophomore safety jordan lovett, the team's no. tackler last fall. junior zion childress could play opposite lovett this fall, and sophomore maxwell hairston stood out this spring. cincinnati transfer jq hardaway is an interesting addition at cornerback, where junior andru phillips also returns. cornerback avery stuart, an espn selection, headlines kentucky's recruiting class, along with espn four-star safety jaremiah anglin jr. future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the longhorns: texas saw the improvement it hoped for on defense in . the unit rose from th nationally in points allowed in to th, and from nd in yards per play allowed to th. the longhorns held alabama to points, tcu to points and shut out short-handed oklahoma in the red river game. veteran coordinator pete kwiatkowski seemed to settle in, and gary patterson's influence on the defense also showed. texas loses key contributors in the front seven but should be able to build around junior edge rusher barryn sorrell, linebacker jaylan ford, senior tackle t'vondre sweat and others. ford earned first-team all-big honors in after leading texas in tackles (), interceptions () and forced fumbles (), while tying for second in tackles for loss (). he'll be complemented by veterans such as senior jett bush and junior morice blackwell jr., and also emerging young players like freshman anthony hill, espn's top inside linebacker and no. overall recruit in the class. future defense power rankings: not ranked future defense power rankings: scouting the broncos: after squeaking into the defense rankings last year, boise state continued to strengthen the unit under coach andy avalos and coordinator spencer danielson. the broncos finished sixth nationally in yards allowed and th in points allowed last season. they will miss all-mountain west standouts jl skinner and ezekiel noa but return linebacker dj schramm, who led the team in total tackles () and tackles for loss (.). schramm will pair with sophomore andrew simpson, who had tackles and three sacks last year, although boise state will need to build depth for and . the broncos lose tackle scott matlock and several other key line contributors. edge rusher demitri washington, who tied for the team lead with . sacks last season, returns for his sixth year. junior gabe hunter and senior cortez hogans add depth on the perimeter. juniors herbert gums and ahmed hassanein should solidify the interior line through . boise state bolstered its depth by adding line transfers kivon wright (boston college), tyler wegis (utah) and sheldon newton (northern arizona). the secondary projects well through , although there are some short-term gaps to fill after losing skinner and others. junior safety rodney robinson finished second on the team in interceptions () and fourth in tackles (), and will lead the unit alongside versatile junior seyi oladipo. junior jaylen clark is also back after recording an interception and five pass breakups last year. senior cornerback markel reed missed all but one game last season with injury but started four contests in . linebacker wyatt milkovic, an espn three-star recruit, headlined boise state's class. future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the trojans: troy won the increasingly competitive sun belt conference under a first-year coach (jon sumrall) with an offense that finished th nationally in scoring and failed to score points in five games. the defense was exceptional under sumrall and coordinator shiel wood, who left for the same post at tulane. troy ranked no. nationally in both points allowed and turnovers gained and in the top in several other key statistical categories. the unit will miss linebacker carlton martial, who set the fbs career tackles record with , and other key members. but troy brings back several standouts, including top pass-rushers t.j. jackson and richard jibunor, both all-sun belt selections who combined for . sacks and . tackles for loss last season. junior bandit javon solomon complements the rush after recording . sacks in . reddy steward, who led troy in interceptions () and pass breakups (), also will be back to team with fellow senior cornerback o'shai fletcher. troy's immediate challenge is replacing martial and safety craig slocum jr., who combined for tackles last season, as well as first-team all-conference lineman will choloh and safety tj harris. senior safety dell pettus is back after a -tackle season, and junior keyshawn swanson will take on a bigger role through . the trojans also added iowa transfer reggie bracy, who appeared in games for the hawkeyes. like safety, linebacker is an immediate question, as sophomores terry thomas and jordan stringer emerge alongside jayden mcdonald, who was limited to three games last season. troy also added junior college standouts raymond cutts and t.j. thompson. future defense power ranking: scouting the buckeyes: the unit has regressed for most of coach ryan day's tenure, although it showed clear improvement last season, especially on third down, before breakdowns in losses to michigan and georgia. for day, a coach who has taken the quarterback position to historic heights in columbus, the primary mission remains getting the defense back on track. coordinator jim knowles enters his second season and will be working with enough high-level talent to clean things up in the next three years. all three levels of defense return key contributors. the line should become a major strength again, especially if ends j.t. tuimoloau and jack sawyer, both espn top-five recruits, consistently hit their potential. sophomores caden curry and kenyatta jackson should provide production, especially in . hopes are high at the defensive tackle spot where veterans ty hamilton and tyleik williams return, as well as junior mike hall jr., who logged . sacks last fall. future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the beavers: few units had a bigger breakthrough in than oregon state, which led the pac- in total defense, scoring defense and rushing defense, after struggling for much of . trent bray, promoted from interim coordinator to the permanent role in december , masterfully oversaw a renaissance, as oregon state finished th nationally in points allowed. oregon state will miss speights, its tackles leader who transferred to lsu, as well as star defensive backs rejzohn wright and alex austin. riley sharp, who had a team-high three sacks last season, has moved to tight end. the beavers will need more from their defensive line, which returns veterans such as james rawls and isaac hodgins, as well as non-seniors sione lolohea and oluwaseyi omotosho, a transfer from wyoming. freshman kelze howard is an intriguing young prospect. bray and coach jonathan smith both recently told espn that the line should be the unit's strength in . future defense power ranking: scouting the cyclones: i considered removing isu after a last-place finish in the big , but the defense is still far from the problem in ames. the cyclones finished fourth nationally in yards allowed, th in points allowed, th against the run and eighth in efficiency. since , isu is ninth nationally in efficiency. although some key contributors depart, including edge rusher will mcdonald iv and linebacker o'rien vance, coordinator jon heacock remains as one of the nation's best. isu's defense is set up to continue on a positive trajectory. second-team all-big cornerback t.j. tampa returns and will pair with myles purchase, a junior who had tackles last year. junior safety beau freyler also is back in the secondary after finishing second on the team with tackles. freyler, jeremiah cooper, malik verdon and trevon howard are all safeties who can help carry isu beyond the season. senior gerry vaughn headlines the linebacker group after recording a team-high tackles in . isu must build around him this year with players such as jacob ellis, a junior college all-america selection in who redshirted last year. the team will need ellis and several other non-seniors to carry the group in . junior defensive end joey petersen steps into a bigger pass-rushing role after mcdonald and mj anderson's departures. petersen and other non-seniors, such as junior j.r. singleton and sophomore tyler onyedim, are set to lead the line for several more seasons. senior tackle isaiah lee gives the group a veteran presence. future defense power ranking: not ranked scouting the herd: here's another sun belt team entering the power rankings after an impressive stretch, punctuated by a season in which it ranked sixth nationally in points allowed ( ppg) and seventh in fewest yards per play against (. ypp). marshall will miss several standout players and coordinator lance guidry, who left to oversee miami's defense, but there's excitement about jason semore's arrival and chevis jackson's promotion to co-coordinator. the herd will once again be led by first-team all-sun belt selections owen porter at defensive end and micah abraham at cornerback, along with leading tackler eli neal and others. porter will anchor the line alongside senior sam burton, who had five sacks and seven quarterback hurries last season. tyqaze leggs also is back to fortify the interior after a three-sack season, and junior elijah alston could be set for a bigger role. marshall also added florida transfer chris thomas. abraham, who had six interceptions in , headlines a secondary that should be marshall's strength in the short term and potentially beyond . semore likes the -- alignment and should feature plenty of dbs. the group returns safety kerion martin, who had tackles last season, and cornerback jadarius green-mcknight, who enters his second year with the team after transferring from florida state. cornerback daytione smith, who has sophomore eligibility, should see more field time, and marshall brought in cornerback j.j. roberts, a wake forest transfer. neal is the only major returning contributor at linebacker, but marshall added transfer kesean brown, who appeared in games with appalachian state. other transfers include linemen kylen mccracken (ohio) and michael green (virginia), and linebacker tah mac bright (incarnate word). linebacker jaden yates leads a solid group of incoming defensive recruits. future defense power ranking: scouting the aztecs: like several teams included in this power rankings version, san diego state didn't reach its overall goals in but continued to excel on defense. the aztecs finished th nationally in both points allowed and rushing yards allowed, and th in total yards allowed. there's also a longevity component, as san diego state ranks fifth nationally in points allowed since . the aztecs lose a lot from the defense, including first-team all-mountain west selections jonah tavai, caden mcdonald and patrick mcmorris, and second-team selection michael shawcroft, so some short-term regression is possible. but coach brady hoke must feel good about who returns in the back seven, which will feature senior linebacker cooper mcdonald and dynamic cornerback tandem dallas branch and dezjhon malone. sdsu also has experience at safety with seniors cedarious barfield and davaughn celestine, who finished fourth and fifth on the team in tackles last fall. new mexico transfer cody moon, an honorable-mention all-league selection in , adds depth at linebacker, along with seniors vai kaho and kyron white, a converted safety. sophomore safety eric butler shined in the spring game alongside junior cornerback noah avinger. san diego state's immediate challenge comes up front, where it must replace both jonah and justus tavai, and productive end keshawn banks. senior garret fountain should help after recording three sacks and six tackles for loss in , and veteran holdovers such as daniel okpoko and wyatt draeger likely will take on bigger roles. the aztecs went to the portal for help, adding transfers such as samuela tuihalamaka (oklahoma state) and talib salahuddin (riverside city college). if they can hold up, the defense should continue to remain among the best in the mountain west.""}",jonathan tah,en,2023-04-26T11:24:16Z

"julien laurens describes the incredible ability of psg starlet warren zaire-emery. (:) on saturday, the entire parc des princes crowd (attendance: ,) rose suddenly with a collective scream of excitement. the fans were fixated on a paris saint-germain player who\'d grabbed their attention -- something that didn\'t happen too much during the - win over toulouse in which, once again, the ligue champions were average. the noise increased as this psg player continued an impressive run, dribbling beyond several tackles. was it lionel messi? neymar? kylian mbappe? no. the guy responsible for this thrilling moment was -year-old midfielder warren zaire-emery. on the right wing close to the touchline, he ran the whole length of the pitch, escaping two slide tackles before squaring the ball on the edge of the box to messi, who didn\'t do much with it. a few days before the toulouse game, zaire-emery made history by becoming the youngest scorer in psg history at years and days old, converting against montpellier (-) to seal the win for his team -- not long after becoming the youngest psg player to play for the first team. he had come on minutes earlier and, a bit like on saturday, made a great run down the right flank before entering the box. instead of passing the ball to messi, he smashed an unstoppable shot across goal. the france u international is a prodigy. born in march , the kid from paris is a product of the club\'s academy and arguably the leader of the next golden generation of psg players. he is the a-list star of the gen-z set. one story sums wze up very well. after vitinha arrived from porto in the summer and had settled in following a few training sessions, he said to his agent jorge mendes, who also represents zaire-emery: ""who is this kid that you got in your team? he is an alien!"" vitinha was so impressed by the young box-to-box midfielder, just like anyone else who\'s played with him, played against him or even just watched him play. veteran midfielder marco verratti could not believe what he saw when his young teammate, aged just , joined the first team for his first training session with them. since that day, zaire-emery has beaten record after record to the point that psg decided not to recruit a new midfielder in january so they could give him more game time. like zaire-emery, psg are currently cultivating that next golden generation. when qatar sports investment (qsi) purchased the club in the summer of , one of their missions was to produce the next messi from within the club instead of spending millions to acquire that talent. they did still spend heavily to bring messi, neymar and mbappe to the club, but their academy has also become one of the best in europe and this next class of graduates projects to be special. wednesday, may (all times et) * valencia vs. villarreal (: p.m.) * stuttgart vs. frankfurt (: p.m.) * atletico madrid vs. cadiz ( p.m.) * getafe vs. celta vigo ( p.m.) thursday, may (all times et) * sevilla vs. espanyol (: p.m.) * girona vs. mallorca (: p.m.) * athletic club vs. real betis (: p.m.) * rayo vs. valladolid (: p.m.) friday, may (all times et) * mainz vs. schalke (: p.m.) the other notable ""phenom"" in the psg squad is el chadaille bitshiabu. he is slightly older at , but is just as precocious and impressive as zaire-emery. the central defender was already -foot- at years old and he has continued to develop: now -foot-, he\'s blessed with great awareness and a keen left foot when it comes to building attacks from the back. he\'d also broken a few club records before zaire-emery came along to one-up his teammate. bitshiabu is now getting more and more game time with the first team. he came on at the weekend after minutes, when renato sanches got injured against toulouse. he started against strasbourg at the end of december in ligue , playing minutes in psg\'s - win. when mauricio pochettino arrived at the club in january and watched the reserve team train, bitshiabu was the one who caught his eye. he gave him his first training sessions with the first team and his debut as well, which came in the coupe de la france at just years and days old. he makes mistakes, of course, as you\'d expect at his age -- just like like zaire-emery, whose poor pass led to reims\' equaliser days ago -- but he is learning very quickly and could be a fully enter the centre-back rotation next season alongside marquinhos, milan skriniar (who is arriving this summer from inter milan) and presnel kimpembe. in addition to those two, psg have several other talented academy players breaking through. attacking midfielder ismael gharbi, , and striker ilyes housni, , have also made their first-team debuts this season, showing a lot of promise. midfielder ethan mbappe ( and brother of kylian), attacking midfielder noha lemina ( and brother of former juventus/southampton player mario) and right-back yoram zague () are the next ones in line for more game time at the senior level. all were born or grew up in paris; all are training with the first team regularly and are getting picked in matchday squads, as we saw with gharbi and housni; all are shining with france\'s youth teams and for gharbi the spain youth team also, as he can represent both. of course, the gap between the reserve team or u team and the psg first team is huge, but there is all-round belief within the club that this is a very special group. ""of course, we will give time to our young players,"" said campos. ""the manager christophe galtier understands this is our project. we have made room in our squad to make space for the youngsters instead of losing them to other top european clubs."" some of them will succeed at the parc des princes, while some might not. time will tell, though they\'re certainly dreaming about it.'}",moussa diaby,en,2023-02-08T19:23:49Z

celta vigo in may - - with man utd - and real betis this season - a - defeat.ben grounds sevilla vs fenerbahce, kick-off pm when you think of the europa league, you think of sevilla. the spanish side have won the competition six times, whereas no other team can lay claim to more than three titles. but when assessing the likely winners this season, it's hard to make the case for jorge sampaoli's outfit adding to their record haul. after entering as laliga title contenders thanks to a strong start to last season, sevilla drifted away during the second half of the campaign under current wolves manager julen lopetegui, and their struggles grew this term to such an extent that lopetegui was dismissed amid the prospect of a relegation battle. sampaoli - the bald-headed, tattooed bundle of anger and energy that oversaw argentina's chaotic world cup campaign - was brought in to spark a revival that hasn't properly materialised. after eight wins in games following the world cup, sevilla have drawn one and lost three of their last four matches, and find only goal difference separating them from laliga's relegation zone. a return to europa league action will perhaps provide a welcome distraction from their domestic toil, while even triggering memories of happier times. on the other hand, a failure to eliminate fenerbahce will only increase the darkness that is closing around sampaoli and his underperforming side.joe shread juventus vs freiburg, kick-off pm historically, the gulf is vast. juventus are two-time champions of europe. freiburg are into the last of european competition for the first time. but the german side are fifth in their table while their illustrious opponents are eighth in theirs. this will be interesting. speaking to freiburg goalkeeper mark flekken, it is a moment that he has been waiting his whole career for. until he joined freiburg in , aged , the dutchman had not even played top-division football let alone competed in europe. his story sums up this team. they are not superstars but they do have a plan. juventus must watch out for set-pieces and they will need to be organised and together - because their opponents will be. freiburg, the team from the black forest guided by christian streich, are a club united. with smart recruitment and a rare togetherness, freiburg face juventus with confidence as they chase champions league football ""they put a very big value on character,"" says flekken. ""they really search for those people who will fit in the group. it is one close team. it is not only talent. it is also hard work. that comes on top of everything. if you combine that with talent you can reach the sky."" beating juventus over two legs would be some achievement but freiburg have already won - away to olympiakos and - at nantes. if they can keep it close in turin, they will be optimistic ahead of the second leg - they are unbeaten at home since august.adam bate could you win PS, for free on tuesday with super ? entries by pm, good luck!

""he is making the most of his loan, making differences for osasuna,"" barca coach xavi said sunday. ""they are really happy with him in pamplona, he\'s professional, playing really well. at barca, the level he was at on saturday, you have to be at in every game. when he returns, we will look at it and decide what we do with him. he could be an important player in the future."" barcelona\'s frenkie de jong and west ham\'s declan rice have also been linked with united. . bst: arsenal striker folarin balogun is being tracked by ac milan, says calciomercato. balogun, , is on loan at reims this season and has goals in games for the club in all competitions. however, arsenal have gabriel jesus and eddie nketiah up front so the england under- international may not return to the emirates. instead, the gunners could move him on for more than EURm. . bst: barcelona are preparing a ""revolution"" in the attacking positions this summer in an attempt to provide more support for robert lewandowski, according to diario sport. yannick carrasco, pierre-emerick aubameyang, vitor roque and abde ezzalzouli could all be part of xavi hernandez\'s first-team squad next season with ansu fati, ferran torres and raphinha\'s futures all said to be in doubt. lewandowski has netted league goals, while ansu, ferran, raphinha and ousmane dembele have managed just between them. while a much-improved defence has meant that hasn\'t cost them in laliga, it has seen them come up short in the champions league, the europa league and the copa del rey. the catalan side also want to add a striker to take the weight off lewandowski. brazilian teenager roque is their top target, but if his price tag proves too high, they could bring aubameyang back from chelsea if he accepts a salary cut. that means, according to sport, that barca will listen to offers for ansu, ferran and raphinha to help fund the changes up front. steve nicol gives his take on the title race after arsenal dropped points in a - draw with liverpool at anfield. - borussia dortmund are keeping an eye on burnley winger anass zaroury and sent scout benjamin frank to watch the -year-old, claims the sun, who add that olympique de marseille, monaco and standard liege have also watched him. having seen the morocco international help the clarets reclaim their place in the premier league, bvb could make zaroury part of a recruitment drive if jude bellingham leaves in the summer.",moussa diaby,en,2023-04-10T00:05:42Z

"this week, the testimony of ben youssouf keita struck a chord. he is the third opponent of moussa dadis camara\'s former regime to testify at the conakry stadium massacre trial. victim and eyewitness of the bloody repression of september , , he recounted the fatal chain of events that led to the killings. on tuesday april , , ben youssouf keita, a -year-old surgeon and politician, was called to the stand. he is now the president of the alliance for change and progress party. at the time of the events, he was a member of the political bureau of the union of democratic forces of guinea (ufdg). he was even the right-hand man of the party leader, cellou dalein diallo, according to journalist mouctar bah, an informed observer of guinea in the late s. keita is the third political opponent to be heard at the trial. he has just become a civil party in the case. ""some people are certainly wondering why, years later, i am presenting myself today, and in a spontaneous manner,"" he said. ""well, for two reasons. first, if my fate was more enviable than those who lost their lives, my wife suffered martyrdom at the stadium [she was beaten by soldiers and had her throat cut]."" second, as a political leader keita feels it is his duty to come and testify: ""we have a moral responsibility towards those who died, because they are our activists. we are the ones who called them to follow us."" no to dadis as presidential candidate on september , , the main opposition parties - united in a coalition called forces vives - organized a meeting to say no to the possible presidential candidacy of captain moussa dadis camara, leader of the military transition. security forces burst in on the rally, firing live ammunition into the crowd and sexually assaulting female activists. in the days that followed, killings and rapes continued. according to the report of the international commission of inquiry appointed by the united nations, at least people were killed and women raped. keita tells the story of his day. it was . on the morning of september , , when his phone rang. ""it was my older brother retired from the guinean army calling me,"" he told the court. ""this brother, i consider him a father, he followed me to the ufdg. he was one of the people in charge of the executive office, in the security commission. he told me \'youssouf, don\'t go out today, it\'s forbidden, you have to stay at home\'. at that time, we still remembered the events of january-february , during which at least young guineans were killed in cold blood during demonstrations. as my brother was insisting and it was unusual, i panicked."" then, according to his testimony in court, ben youssouf keita said to himself: ""if i don\'t leave, i will be considered a traitor, a coward. what must happen will happen."" warnings don\'t stop the opposition the two men set off towards the home of jean-marie dore, another opponent and head of the union for the progress of guinea (upg). the political leaders had made an appointment to meet there. once there, his householders were hesitant. ""jean-marie dore tells cellou, sidya (sidya toure, president of the union of republican forces) and the others that he cannot go,"" they said, according to keita. ""he has just spoken to the head of state by telephone. the latter asked him to wait for the arrival of a delegation to meet with the leaders at his home."" toure received the same call late at night, he said, but felt it was impossible to postpone the rally. diallo spoke up, according to keita, saying: ""we have to leave, because the population has already turned out, we have no way to delay the rally."" all the opposition leaders - with the exception of dore - then set off to join ""the bulk of the troops at the stadium"". ""there was so much noise, you couldn\'t hear the gunfire"" a ""human tide"" awaited them there, according to ben youssouf keita, an estimated several thousand people. while the politicians had planned to make their speech on the esplanade in front of the stadium, they were dragged inside by a frenzied crowd. ""it was euphoria, celebration,"" he recalled. keita climbed into the stands with the other leaders. there was an atmosphere of joyful chaos. ""there was so much noise, you couldn\'t hear the gunfire,"" he told the court. suddenly, he saw people starting to fall under fire. the danger was getting closer, and everyone was fleeing. it was ""every man for himself"". keita stayed next to his leader. a hooded soldier advanced towards them. he called out to diallo and ordered him to come down from the stands. the ufdg leader did not comply. the soldier charged at him, made him fall to the ground and hit him brutally. keita escaped and miraculously managed to get out of the stadium. but in front of the entrance, just as he thought he was out of trouble, he came across a soldier armed with a piece of wood who tried to smash his skull. keita protected himself and escaped with a broken hand and a wound on his back. diallo suffered four broken ribs. several opposition leaders were injured that day, but none fatally. opposition responsibility? ben youssouf keita was admitted to the emergency room of donka hospital, he said, around -. in the afternoon. while waiting to be taken care of, he saw ""young people, women, lying around moaning"". the minister of health, colonel abdoulaye cherif diaby who is now in the dock, ""passed within a metre"" of him, according to the witness, reprimanding the wounded. he was ""furious"", according to keita. ""i am here today to understand,"" he told the court. ""i have absolutely no hatred against anyone, i do not cry vengeance and i do not want any compensation, neither material nor financial, but i want to understand. when you understand something you can tolerate it, bear it. why didn\'t this minister of health, who took the hippocratic oath, act like a doctor? he didn\'t have the pity he should have when faced with those who suffer."" get the latest in african news delivered straight to your inbox by submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy. almost finished... there was a problem processing your submission. please try again later. at the trial, the surgeon\'s testimony unleashed passions. the defence lawyers, more divided than ever, clashed. one of them questioned keita: ""doctor, you have maintained here that if you had complied with the request to postpone the demonstration on september , what happened at the stadium would not have happened. do you stand by this statement? keita nodded. lancine sylla, counsel for moussa dadis camara\'s former aide-de-camp aboubacar diakite (""toumba"") retorted: ""do you agree with me that in this trial you, the political leaders, are victims and not defendants?"" ""there is no doubt."" ""as such, can we seek any responsibility against you in this trial?"" ""absolutely not."" ""we didn\'t think they would send men to the stadium with helmets and lethal weapons against the unarmed population,"" keita said in defence. the scenario he painted through his words is that of a punitive, premeditated and inevitable attack against an opposition that was defying the authority of the head of state to defend democratic principles. ""mr. bah oury said it here, and so did mr. francois louceny fall [the two politicians previously heard by the court]. was it on the day of the demonstration itself that a postponement could be called?"" asked toumba\'s lawyer.

" manchester city have sold arsenal players recently - now the gunners might be about to return the favour to their rivals manchester city want an arsenal favourite this summer, who\'s unsettled at the emirates stadium. last summer, arsenal bought gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko from manchester city - but now, guardiola may be about to return the favour. sources have told football insider (opens in new tab) that kieran tierney is being eyed up by city, as the eastlands outfit eye a natural left-back for their system. guardiola was close to bringing marc cucurella to the etihad last season, eventually losing out on the spaniard to chelsea. this was to replace joao cancelo at left-back with a natural left-footer, giving jack grealish the freedom to move inside while maintaining width with the system. this term, nathan ake has fulfilled the role superbly but tierney represents a fascinating option for city, given his underrated versatility. the scot has struggled with playing inverted for arteta but was one of his most important players in previous seasons, despite injury troubles. tierney can play as a centre-back in a back three - like he does for scotland - or as a left-back in a back four. this would provide guardiola with a profile similar to kyle walker on the opposite flank. according to the report, tierney is privately valued at around PS million by arsenal. the sun\xaclaims that the left-back is also wanted by newcastle united. tierney is valued to be worth EURm by transfermarkt (opens in new tab). with\xaerling haaland breaking goal records a-plenty, pep guardiola said that\xamanchester city are monitoring the striker\'s fitness "" hours a day"". ilkay gundogan is rumoured to be a major target\xafor barcelona this summer, while\xaguardiola has explained why major city stars are being subbed early. one\xaburnley star has told\xafft\xathat vincent kompany could manage the citizens\xaone day. thank you for reading articles this month* join now for unlimited access enjoy your first month for just PS / $ / EUR *read free articles per month without a subscription join now for unlimited access try first month for just PS / $ / EUR the best features, fun and footballing quizzes, straight to your inbox every week. liverpool report: james milner\'s next move \'all but done\' to premier league rivals arsenal report: transfer budget for the summer revealed, as gunners plan biggest summer spend ever \'we\'re going to figure it out\': chelsea co-owner todd boehly makes promise to fans after \'humbling\' season by ryan dabbs may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by mark white may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may by ryan dabbs may (c)",moussa diaby,en,2023-04-28T09:59:52Z

"arsenal have not underwhelmed, they have overachieved this season by patrick s at the start of the season, arsenal were dismissed as top four contenders. most football experts in all media outlets in england were utterly dismissive of arsenal's top prospects. in august for example, out of the bbc sport football pundits, only thought arsenal would finish in the top and none of those thought arsenal would finish higher than th! watch arteta after etihad defeat - ""man city deserved to win"" ""they are an exceptional team....."" calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... yes. we have achieved our target which is top . but wasn't it the same target for last season? it's taken is seasons to achieve the target for season. i would rather say we were ""high flying"" this season rather than ""over achieving"". and guess what. ""high flying"" will hardly fill the pages of history. capitulating last season's ending as well as this season's ending due to the same issues shows there are still serious problems not resolved last season target was to qualify for any european cup, not champions league precisely no it was not. arteta himself said he wanted arsenal back in the c l inside years, which was last season. he did, but the task was bigger than most people thought. overachiever funny, a leicester team from no where won the league, it's about finishing the story, that leicester team would have come second and be remembered as a wonderful season for the size of the club but they saw the opportunity and grabbed it, this opportunity will not come around every season, many clubs were having a terrible season we were fantastic and created a healthy enough lead that should be able to see us through the line but failed, in few years time this could be remembered as a squandered opportunity. our best performance against city has come from the fa cup and on that night we had trossart,vieira,tierney,nkettiah rob holding all starting while city had their full squad but we played so well that city managed a one nil victory, what i saw that night was a team set up to man mark city players all over the pitch and they struggled to the extend gadiola had to change tactics in the game, the point was the team had what they needed to cross the line but was let down by the manager tactically and squad management skills, last year we experienced same lost in a row went to stanford bridge with a back and got the win at this point of the season, it's not about principles, it's not about dominant football, it's about points this is called the business end of the season when everyone is fighting, city didn't do much against fulham yesterday other than grab the points, it's not about trying a flirk, skills or showing that you are the best team, it's about going out there and bringing the points by any means thats what it's all about at this time of the season if that has been in our managers mind we would not have lost all these points we recently dropped from a position of strength it was arsenals to lose. but naivety crept in. we play same style as city, only thing is they are better at it. so when meeting them, change tactics to defensive and counter attacks, but the manager thought we could match them boy to man. leading two against west ham and continue to play as if the game is still nil/nil. i would say the manager could have done better with game management. he failed the test his only win against city was in an fa cup we just played on the counter and won, that's what i admire about madrid they play in any way that gives them the w at the end of the day history only remembers the winners.. there is nothing wrong in knowing ur teams weakness and playing to their strength, if the players available have shown they can't play the way you want then play to their strength, till everyone is back every team is looking to exploit opposition weaknesses you are right. history only remembers the winner. history could have remembered us as / pl champions and not we top the table for most weeks. are we into the cl to be eliminated and fall back to europa league? i would still prefer the pl trophy. you are right gun down. poor game management. it's all about points not style. if you are leading up. change tactics immediately and use defensive plus counter attacks. you are absolutely right. arsenal made a formidable start to the season. we took the lead in the table. when the league resumed after the wc break, everybody was concernbed about how we would cope, when starting up again, and we would be without jesus. again we stood up to the pressure, and just kept going. it is because the progress is built on a solid foundation laid over the past couple of years, and there is every chance, we can do well again in the coming years. yes, more can be expected next season from the likes of liverpool and chelsea. but, every season is always the same. some ""big"" teams will underperform, also next year. we are, where we are in our own right and not because others have faltered. arsenal behind the league champion since .: / # chelsea, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. / # liverpool, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind there's no doubt that we have almost closed the gap, and i believe our progression will continue next season :red_circle: sorry, i forgot the / season. # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. there is no divine right that we wouldn't fall + points behind the winner next time or win it, ask liverpool, it's hard to predict the future the one the that we should be worried about is how we trow the top away last season and proberbly learned nothing this season by proberbly trowing away the title again in similar fashion... well, i don't believe we will be + points behind next season. we have a young team with potential to get better, and i'm sure we will recruit more quality players next summer. liverpool have and old team and haven't been clever enough with their recruitments lately. we are not throwing away anything but have to realise that other clubs are stronger. man.city has still a much better squad than us, but we are getting closer. personally i don't like deficit mentality, man city been better than us is not the reason we are failing, tell me the difference between the way we are failing now and what happened last season, it's almost similar fashion when the team needed help the manager failed them, do you believe that even next season we will be better than season? that's a question i want you to sincerely answer... if we lose the title please it has nothing to do with the quality of city it's purely of our own making.. i understand that people want to remain positive but let's be realistic why we are failing short and tackle our own demons i never thought we were going to win the league this season, which i have said many times. why do man.city win the league year after year and reach the semifinal or the final of cl almost every year. man.city is probably the best team of the world and they bought the best striker in the world to make them better, and he has already made goals for them this season. there's a reason why we haven't won the league since . the main reason is that other teams are better than us like it or not. yes, i believe that we will be a top team next season as well, what we have will be better next season. last season we finished the season with points, now we have and still five games left. well it's your opinion and some valid point there too... one can also argue that it's not always about the players maybe city have the best manager in the world also, who make everything tik, personally i believe if gadiola managed our squad this season we would have won the league, everyone has been complaining about city's spending the truth is others like united and chelsea have spent equally as much. football every season is different with it's challenges that we finished point below city doesn't mean next season we win the league, doesn't even guarantee next season city will be the best team... liverpool pushed city for season's look at them this season, they can win it this season, i don't like predicting the future, we can prepare our best but others will equally prepare, these closed gap doesn't mean we are automatically disposed others as title contenders you can look at it in many direction. even if we have our best recruitment next season city will still probably have the better squad, this season what happened last season that ended our top hope repeated again, if city win the league eventually, how does that have to do with the quality of city? i believe we have a very good foundation and i'm optimistic about our future and this is my objective. let's finish the season before we are making any conclusions. how can you say we have a good foundation and be optimistic? according to the ""realists"" on ja we have bottled it, our captain is not good enough, our players are overrated, we have no plan b, we have failed this season, every other manager is more experienced and has better tactics. in fact, there really is no hope because this season is over, mc are better, mu are better and next year we have no chance again because everyone else is going to be better. it's been a terrible season and the future's bleak. @ gun down...life is not that complicated at all, people only make it hard to live in for themselves.. in real life if you don't like the way things are shaping out in your place of work and you've got no power to change things...the best thing is for you to look for another job... the same goes with supporting a club. if arsenal as a club or ateta are so useless to the extent that you're sad with our performance this year .. you're free to support man city the better club ... at least it's free to support any club ... it's normal to complain but it's annoying to keep repeating the same thing over and over when you can at least get your happiness from elsewhere.... where you able to achieve all your personal goals for this year even when you put in all your possible best ... that show's you that, what you thought to be ""your best"" might look like a ""your mistake"" to others ... life can definitely overrule any plan and hardwork ... at any time... i hope we get the two english players ornstein's touting. they're best of mates and look to be in need of ""a new challenge"", or whatever they call it these days. arteta is still learning on the job, and has almost completed his best season, and will get better, and the team along with him. we'll challenge again. this season has been quite a ride. nice saying jax :thumbs_up: yes. but the second place isn't guaranteed yet, because we still have to play against chelsea/ newcastle/ brighton and we will have two more games after that and one of those games after that is nottingham forest who beat liverpool the other day and drew with man city previously, walloped brighton last week. their lowly position doesn't seem to matter when they're at home. they will put in extra efforts if they still have a good chance to stay in epl liverpool beat forest - on the october forest beat liverpool at home -. it's their home form i was talking about. yes we have over achieved from what we have done the previous seasons where we have underachieved. like last season we have finished higher than the season before but also like last season, we have failed to take a opportunity. th last season was ours and we threw it away. st this season was ours and we threw it away. now i hear some people say, dont get gready!!!!! well i am not gready just a little worried about the soft under belly that still exists. there are reasons why we have capitulated this season and it was not due to injuries ( all though they dont help ) it was due to the way we cant sustain our form under pressure. our set up is flimsy and the way the manager and players handle it is not very inspiring. well done for second but lets not get all gushy. why are we saying overachieving, please let's be realistic a season that saw chelsea and liverpool spend most of their season mid table, a season that united are rd or th playing in two cup finals with a manager in his first season at united, a season that saw newcastle probably ending in top , outside city and wobbling liverpool with aging squad we and city are the most stable club currently, mind u even in the mist of all these we are probably ending trophyless, knocked out at both cups at earliest possible, just made it past the europa group stage and sent home... the truth is if city were to win the league then it's a big missed opportunity, i can't see many top clubs dropping this low next season take a look at the whole picture and tell me where arsenal would have finished and be see as progress, below united and newcastle who finished last season below us and who have managers that is less than two years and one year with their clubs respectively. arsenal title challenge this season is not over. chelsea is next. our dip at a crucial time was a combination of factors imho. . lack of proper rotation. no need to reshuffle starting , start or different players while starting one's in form. . injuries to key players at critical times. . not dropping players out of form . no plan b or change in approach or play when the team is clearly struggling. . players can't dig themselves out of a crisis, and our leaders aren't leading when the team falters. still a lot of work to be done next year. the mental aspect still an issue, and a plan b when things go sideways. can't approach every game with the same tactics, even pep and klopp change things up when needed. yes, we haven't closed the tremendous gap but it's definitely decreasing. we are lacking squad depth and haven't the best squad either, but we are moving in the right direction. well dp, there are plenty who will disagree that we haven't got squad depth. i don't think we have squad depth or sufficient quality from those who are fit. it is overlooked that tomi has a long term injury. right now we lack squad depth but by august it will be stronger surely! well said @ durand. total agreement with you. squad depth is a myth!!!!! and a poor excuse. the last four games, the only first team regular missing was saliba. if we are that flimsy then we will never win anything. one player out does not allow squad depth to be a valid excuse. it is a poor excuse and not the reason. i avoided saying this because i knew people will attack me, people saying injuries makes me laugh maybe i will make an article about our struggles but maybe that too will be seen as a negative article it probably will be (seen as negative), but a fully fit top-quality squad is obviously key to success over the whole season. that's your opinion and not mine. do guardiola share your opinion :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: no didrik, its fact, saliba is the only first team player missing these last four games and we have had a healthy bench in all areas. unlike you reggie, i didn't think arsenal could go the whole season without a dip in form. saliba has been one of arsenal's best players this season and among the league's best centre-backs. his importance to the team is highlighted by how many goals arsenal conceded on average before and after he was injured. i don't think saliba's absence is the whole reason, but our defense has definitely become more vulnerable during his absence. yes it has nobody is denying that. the problem is, are we so finely tuned that one little piece goes missing andxwe collapse? or have we got no plan b, or are we so flimsy one piece missing, its good night irene. because that has what has happened. the squad is still in good shape, the team not so. we aren't good enough and we have never achieved points during a season. man.city has achieved points several times, and when you need points+ to win the league you can't make many mistakes. we have had a tremendous epl season and has almost closed the points gap between our clubs. i'm optimistic about our future and i believe we will get better next season. coyg dp, agree, but the problem for next season is that liverpool and chelsea can't be as poor as they were this season, newcastle united, manchester united and aston villa are on an upward trend, with good managers and have owners willing and able to spend, while clubs like tottenham hotspurs, brighton & hove albion, brentford and fulham will be more than nuisance value. next season should be very competitive for the champions league places and arsenal will have the added demands of competing in europe, plus hopefully greater attention to the domestic cups. i don't worry about next season i believe we will get better become a regular top club again. if we are second best this season we should aim for the title next season. just think about the journey we have had last three years... there could yet be a twist in this season, as city have two potential trip-ups for their final games. unpredictable brentford and wonderful bha may be our saviours yet. it's not over as long as we do not drop any more points, but i'm sure the players are quite aware of this. are you guys not tired of this? we are out of all competition and wobbling, we keep predicting city have this, they play that and are in fa cup final and semi finals of the ucl, we play a game every week and look so jaded still.. agree gd, we are out of form and city are bang in form. where do these people think this massive turn around is going to come. and same people saliba is still out so your theories make no sense. winning by stretching rules or using lawyers to find weaknesses in uefa's financial fair play regulations. football has become a dirty business and man.city should have been stopped long time ago. agree dp, but money talks with football; you only have to look at the track record of the english fa and fifa (look no further than the award of the world cup to qatar). as for manchester city, a serial offender under ffp, financial penalties are a joke and just gift money to the governing bodies, while loss of points, relegations etc are a pipe dream. yaa your right it's not over ,let win all the games and we see while we have improved from last season ,it will seem like a waste if we do not go on to win the league having been points clear ,also while we have improved other teams have been awful this season that won't be the case next season and i feel we may have missed our chance if we come second . half a billion spent on players we should be seeing improvement anyway ,so to say we have overachieved is an overstatement imo . pts clear with plenty of games to play against city was nothing! we all knew that they could win on the bounce playing in third gear. amazing job managing to get that lead in the first place. i'd be disappointed if another team caught us, but not city. even an amazing liverpool team over a / year period could only finish above city once. straight to the point, good reading, jen. but you skirt over the fact we should have took - points from games that we should have won (liverpool being the exception) .you have to remember that city have their eyes on the big one and have been playing midweek also ,while we went out of el against a really poor team so there was no excuse not to beat southampton and west ham imo ,while it's great we have put up a fight this season it also stinks of last season when we completely folded when top was so easy to get . if we finish second it will be on par with the bottle job from last season ,let's see how long the owners put up with that after so much expenditure,he will get next season no doubt but there won't be anywhere to hide from him or the excuses that arise so often reagarding his tenure here thus far . let's hope city take their eye off the ball and we somehow go on to take the title . do you believe that arsenal started the season and considered themselves title contenders? did you expect arsenal to play league games without dip in form? i never expected us to win the league because we haven't the best first eleven or squad. i felt sad in five minutes time, but realised that arsenal can never compete with a shady club stretching uefa's financial fair play regulations. football have become a dirty business and i hope arsenal never will be like man.city. coyg :thumbs_up: dan, draws, plus loss to everton were critical. it's beyond me anyway that the tone has changed. well pointed out that we have done so well to be where we are. the minute there is a downturn arteta is to blame. weak mentality. no rotation. bottlers and so on but excuses are made for every team who are below us for being out of sorts and who will be better than us next season. . this is a regular football season like all seasons when anything can happen... except that at the moment our arch rivals right now have almost been in a class of their own for / years well ofc arteta is to blame just as emery and wenger before him were too ,i don't get you're point sue . yes we have improved but there was absolutely no excuse to lose so many points in the last games ,i've been right behind arteta and the team all season but i will call out this manager and team when i believe they have let us down ,which they have . would be nice to get out of moderation pat ,maybe blame old jonny boy for my outburst last weekend ,out of sort by me but had a bad week personally . but i won't stand crap from him or anyone else . sorry dan. you are both in moderation till th may. i can't wake up to crap like that. i need a rest well i come back on the th may then it's funny how you keep complaining that there's no excuse for dropping so many points over the last games (arsenal's only genuine bad run so far by the way), yet there's no realisation and acknowledgement that arteta had done a phenomenal job getting us into that position prior to the liverpool game in the first place. for some bizarre reason, you're defining arteta's season on these games and ignoring the insanely good job he did in the first games. he's made mistakes for sure over the last few games, but it's not his fault what ramsdale doing what he did against southampton, or saka missing a crucial pen. stop being so negative all the time, and focus on the huge progression we've made. jen, we have progressed but we should have won it. i didn't believe we could, until the day we lost - at home to city. that might sound strange, but we only went down because two of our players gifted it to city on a plate. we were better than them initially in that game and that actually gave me confidence because i thought (maybe naively) that we would learn from those mistakes. unfortunately we didn't. we have no discipline at the back and sometimes in midfield. that title was there for the taking. the cup was screaming at us to take it home, but we ignored it. the loss of concentration for those games was hugely disappointing dk and virtually ensured the title would slip away from us as i couldn't envisage us beating city after that im just frustrated at the level of blame that has been bandied about after what has been a very good season so far. perhaps it's my ever advancing years that allows me to be more able to take the rough with the smooth and not blow a fuse if the wheel falls off - hopefully temporarily in this case. of course i want arsenal to be numero uno. i still think arteta and the team are evolving but are clearly not at the level of pg and his players and the depth of talent that sits on the bench. would maureen have blown it from our position, no. he would have parked the bus, played in defence or done what he could to have ground out a draw at city. we didn't even park our bike!!!!! would he have gotten us to the lead in the first place. not very likely! his record says yes!! whether you chose to accept it or not arteta is the major reason we might not win the league this season and i bet his favoritism is causing problems behind the scenes. nonsense, man.city is better than us and have been better than us for many years. in addition do they have a better first eleven and squad than us. how often has arsenal achieved points during a season? whatever you think about arteta, man.city won both their games against us and will finish their season with more points than us. it's sad that football is a game run by shady people. we lost the league in the three games previous to the city game. city to us this season should have been irrelevant. we had it and blew it. nothing to do with city. we lost the league because one team is better than us and won both games against us. in addition are they able to achieve + points year after year. we have almost closed the tremendous gap between our clubs, but to finish the league above man.city, and all their famous lawyers are almost impossible. didrik, it's not impossible. it was extremely possible at one point this season. when we went - up at anfield it looked very possible. it's our own fault. if we had the defensive solidity of newcastle we would have won the league..... and easily. even a club like newcastle for instance, haven't got a solid defence because of money, it's because their manager and his team coached their players to defend properly. we on the other hand were too helter-skelter at the back and sometimes in midfield. too many unessary topsy-turvey performances against vastly inferior teams shows that we were not solid enough defensively. both games against city didnt matter, it was the points against the likes of everton, southampton and west ham, that lost us the league, the city game would have been a free hit. the year leicester won the league, they lost to the second team twice that season, us. let's win it next season, but we need to create positive energy around the club :red_circle: :thumbs_up:reggie, so near but no cigar. :face_with_rolling_eyes: so no responsibility from arteta for getting us into that amazing position in the first place then? we must have had a different manager up until the liverpool game then! agree jen, one has to be evenhanded in assessing mickel arteta's management, as he has got a lot right. damn arsenal supporters are negative some damn arsenal supporters are too positive. one can only be positive about this season because we've massively overachieved. imagine a team like qpr getting to an fa cup final, but losing to a team like liverpool or utd in the final, then your own fans calling the players and manager out as bottlers. disgusting! cant say ive seen those words. no one can predict what will happen to underperforming big teams this season when it comes to next season because, last season when we missed top , i remember we are all tipping many big teams to be contenders ahead of us which will make it more harder for arsenal this season to qualify for champions league. but what happened at last ? who would have predicted such a bad season for liverpool, chelsea, even tottenham. we expect them to be contenders the way they finished last season. (especially the way chelsea splash out cash to buy players). but reverse is the case.... so in my opinion. arsenal have gone beyond many expectations this season. therefore, no one can predict what will happen next season as well. all we should hope for is a smart transfer window and far better season for our beloved club next season. coyg. totally agree with you, we should focus on ourselves and what we can influence. is it possible for this team to get better next season? absolutely. how many thought it was possible for arsenal to be title contenders two years ago :red_circle:",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-01T08:30:00Z

"this week, we've been made to believe arteta has a perfect plan to add much-needed quality to his squad in the summer. arsenal want to clinch the premier league title this season, but there is a chance they won't win it. manchester city looks like they are on course for another league title. the gunners' major undoing this season has been that they have yet to have quality options at times. at times, one would argue arteta needed a more quality bench to make game-changing subs when things weren't going according to plan on the pitch, but sadly, he hasn't had one. on the other hand, his main rival, pep guardiola, has quality options to change as much as he likes. that's the perfect definition of why the manchester blues are beating the north london giants to the title. is a PS million transfer budget enough to complete these six deals? darren n video - mikel arteta talks about the reasons arsenal are second - ""we were so close"" calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... caicedo would likely cost more than PS m, diaby might be too expensive as well, zaha is too old to be our winger and guehi's abilities seem too similar to white's i'd be surprised if they just rely on jesus, balogun and trossard for the cf position there is a few options, ndicka is a quality defender from german league, free and would defo upgrade on rob holding who could be sold for a few million along with taveres. get elneny & vieria gone also and replace with teilimans on a free then leaves room and money to buy a quality defensive midfielder to help thomas partey out & cover him. seems declan rice may be that guy or caicedo by the looks of it. that leaves the attacking options to work on. reiss nelson is leaving on a free, flo is back and eddie is hit or miss so its a hard choice what to do there tbh. ode & smithrowe keep battling away against each other is the best way to work that as emile was brilliant in that role and reason he got the no, injuries are killing this young lad. we need a striker who is a natural born goal scorer like a haaland type, big strong fast & knows where the net is. alot of work to be done in the summer, interested now to see are we heading in as champions or runners up. a war chest of PS mill was a recent estimate for four players off the gaffer wish list. not sure what we could salvage from our own fire sale. balogun tavares lonkango marie nelson caicedo rice diaby tapsoba vlohovic zubimendi players on that list alone would cost us million (rice, vlohovic ) diaby imo is worth no more than million not a patch on pepe who's not deemed good enough ,only player on your list i would be interested in would be zubimendi . as for your list as sales we would get million at most ,nelson is out of contract. my word :hushed_face: think they will need minimum million but to really challenge recon million on - top quality players if they do that then believe they can challenge again for the prem league next season although don't think they would have ever got a better chance than winning it this season as everyone else will strengthen there squads and will definitely be more competitive next season so gona get even harder to win the league! lets not forget that man city are fixing their finances to be we're they are. and the fa are allowing this by doing as little as they can. cheating on or off the pitch is always unacceptable.. there's got to be some decent money available as arsenal spent a lot less in the last window due to the mudryk thing falling though. also with the league position certainly being much higher this season than in previous years, and champion's league/etc, that's got to leave things looking very good in terms of funds for bringing in players. too little for a team aspiringuy ivan toney and forget about a winger. we have enough to be champions. i don't believe in spending huge fund on over hyped players. arsenal scouting team should comb the lower leagues in south america, asia and around the world to unearth young talents like martinelli and guendozi etc. we don't need to spend too much to be competitive. chelsea spent fortune in the summer but they are still struggling.. big players don't guarantee success these days, it the tactical approach of the coach that really counts. newcastle is doing well without spending too much. nope!",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-06T07:30:10Z

"the young monaco midfielder has taken an unconventional path in his career and could be on the move again this summer by luke entwistle for get french football news youssouf fofana is not the only player to have graduated from the concrete pitches of the ile-de-france to the france team, but few have followed such an unconventional path. the monaco midfielder is the embodiment of the idea that maturity is not measured in years but in experience. when he joined strasbourg at , he had already endured more setbacks than many players suffer in their entire careers. ""we are one of the countries that has the most access to pitches and it's the first sport we can play together freely,"" says fofana as he attempts to explain why france develops so many young players. riyad mahrez, who grew up in the same region, articulated a similar argument a few years ago. ""we always play outside,"" said mahrez. ""when i go out in england, i never see people playing outside. other countries don't make players the same as france. in france, you can be outside because there are small football pitches everywhere."" however, three years after leaving clairefontaine his abilities earned him a second chance at strasbourg. ""strasbourg prepared me more mentally because their training centre, compared to clairefontaine and monaco, in terms of quality, is a level below. it pushed me to go higher and further, and i improved more mentally than technically or tactically,"" says fofana. poetically, the scene of his greatest disappointment was given new meaning almost years later, in september , when fofana received his first international call-up by didier deschamps. his triumphant return to clairefontaine was secured; having ""left by the small door"" he ""returned through the big door"". france made it past england and, with fofana back in the heart of midfield, they beat morocco - to reach the final. the game against argentina started badly for the reigning champions, who were - down before they started playing. ""maybe we lacked a bit of experience,"" says fofana, who was introduced into the game during extra time. ""in the whole minutes, we only messed up the first , which cost us dearly. if we played the first like we did the rest of the match, we could have won."" despite defeat in doha, france have flourished in recent years. they have reached three of the last four major finals as well as being copied by other international sides, notably england. however, it is a different story at club level. french sides have underwhelmed in european competition this season, with no ligue side reaching the semi-finals of any of the three competitions. nice went the furthest, reaching the quarter-finals of the europa conference league before being knocked out by basel. bernardo silva, a former monaco player, said recently that ligue is ""more difficult, more physical"" than the premier league, yet he is preparing to play in a champions league final while ligue 's fifth place in the uefa coefficient came under considerable threat from the eredivisie this season. ""the french league has a dna as a physical, intense league."" says fofana. ""on the other hand, there are the european competitions where perhaps we need to manage games more to win. france lacks experience given that not many clubs have access to it every year."" despite recognising the challenges facing ligue teams, fofana is positive about the future. ""we lack experience at this level and, with experience, i think we can do big things in europe. little by little, we're getting our bearings and why not next season or in two or seasons, we'll do what italy did this season,"" he says. monaco have become masters of the art of selling. ""we are a big club in france and in europe. it's a bit of a springboard. lots of clubs grab players off us,"" says fofana. tchouameni joined real madrid for EURm last summer, benoit badiashile moved to chelsea for EURm in the january window, and more departures are expected this year, with fofana a target for chelsea according to reports on both sides of the channel. after what he calls the ""most complete season"" of his career so far, he seems open to a move. ""if it is the right opportunity or moment to see something else, i can't say. i don't know but at monaco we are doing things the right way at the moment."" the story of the pizza boy turned world cup finalist is a testament to his own determination and france's elite training system; very few prospects fall through the cracks and many go on to fill premier league squads. having stepped from springboard to springboard, fofana may be the next ligue product to take the plunge in england. this is an article from get french football news follow luke entwistle and gffn on twitter'}",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-26T10:23:06Z

"with the title race over, arteta and his boys set to finish second, can we look forward to what the summer awaits for the gunners? a few weeks ago, a report showed that arteta had a -man summer wish list. in that list, bayer leverkusen winger mousa diaby was featured. there was a suggestion that arteta sees diaby as the perfect alternative to bukayo saka. over the last few seasons, saka has been relied on for the right wing; with no one available to challenge him for that spot the -year-old has delivered, but at times fatigue has held him back. with champions league football back in the emirates, arteta needs saka to be fresh, and for that to be so, he needs to rest occasionally. there needs to be a reliable deputy for saka, and diaby could be that. so what are the chances diaby moves to the emirates? -- afcstuff (@afcstuff) may , daniel o calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... arsenal and anyone concerned should not be talking of back ups. thats part of the problem and why we are becoming ""backups"" spot on. one of our biggest problems this season was that the manager didn't seem to trust that we could win without saka and certain other players. that's one of city's strengths - you can't be certain if grealish will start, or mahrez, or alvarez or even de bruyne, so it's harder to set up against them. it also means they can sub first team players into the game if they need to change it. we need a pool of first team players, not a starting and backups. bowen ,quality player and could be as good as saka if playing in a better team . as for diaby ,no thanks he would be another pepe who imo is better . i think samuel chukwueze is a perfect back up for bukayo i honestly agree we should stop thinking about back ups as we've always treated them as such, believing or arteta always thinking ""they aren't ready"". arsenal should buy a player that can challenge saka for that position and as such bring competition and rotation to bear. if we want to challenge man city, we should buy like man city. quality players of equal strength and value. if we buy to improve our squad, we must learn to use the players, not only as spare tyres. we buy backups and then people complain, the backups are not good enough when the starter is out. what do people expect. if we do buy backups, which i would hope we dont, then we will always struggle. the engine room of a team is the central midfield and the fullbacks. arsenal need energetic athlete players in those positions which was lacking towards the end of this season. so caicedo and rice are perfect options and one quality energetic flexible full back that can play across the back four. i would use tossard as a permanent no first option started and have jesus and saka rotate on the right. tossard should only play as number not as a singer because he lacks the pace but he is creative and intelligent and has close ball control to be an excellent false number . i would promote tierney to rotate with martinelli on the left because they can both carry the ball with energy with martinelli more of a drbbler and tierney more of a crosser of the ball which we lack sometimes. sak a fan also cross the ball better from the left side so he needs to switch wings during the game sometimes to both provide crossed and shake off the double marking which he can't seem to beat. get a top striker who can deliver goals. jesus can compete with saka for rw. all the years with man city and this year with us have shown jesus is not a striker to lead the attack. he has proved himself and arteta wrong. he isnt a striker, pep knew that and is rubbing his hands with glee. durand true said bro, with our pacey wingers we need a center forward, which jesus is not. we need balogun back next season, and make additions to the midfield, defense and forwards. the we are good to go and compete for both the league and champions league. we are still hurting not winning the league. use one stone and kill two birds by bringing in an attack bully as in vlohovic leaving jesus and saka to compete on the right never mind back ups .the need for a stronger c.f has been evident since jesus returned from injury as he has been distinctly average at best imo.many well known central strikers have been mentioned in despatches and most would cost upwards of m.bearing in mind the need for quality recruits in central midfield, our budget is unlikely to extend to a high cost cf.however there is a young central striker currently playing for coventry city who may well be available for nearer m.i refer to victor gyokeres, the young swedish international.i have seen him on occasions this season and he has impressed me and many professional pundits.at ''' "" he is physically powerful and adept at holding up the ball. while he is not a flier, he makes great runs between the lines and is a good finisher.he is a handful in the championship and while he may find it more difficult in the premier league we should not lose sight of the fact that the likes of toney and watkins served their apprenticeship in the lower division and have gone on to do very well at a higher level. grandad, i watched that swedish striker the other night and totally agree with you. he looks a right handful. i always like hearing your recommendations - i hadn't heard of this player, but he looks interesting. one player i'm interested to know about is chuba akpom - he's had a fantastic season from the looks of it. have you had a chance to catch any of his games? i'm wondering if he's finally blooming and if you think he would be useful back at arsenal? i gues leo of ac milan could couilddo a lot in my own opinion although i like the look of kulusevki, i would go for bowen, as i would say with bowen there's more end product. yes davi i've seen akpom a few times for middlesborough and while he has done well, i think gyokeres is better.i also agree with hd and others on ja who appreciate bowen .he must be one of the hardest workers in the epl with great attitude and skill and he can finish.a cut above trossard imo. thanks for the reply - i have no idea, but it would be nice to bring back one of our former youth players. has to be at the level though!",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-21T11:00:00Z

"the uefa europa league final in budapest won't simply provide the opportunity to lift international silverware for italian side roma, who last night knocked out germany's bayer leverkusen in a hard-fought semifinal return leg. last night, both uefa europa league semifinals were packed with drama. at ramon sanchez pizjuan stadium, sevilla and juventus offered a very entertaining first half, featuring clear goal-scoring opportunities on both ends. the bianconeri probably had the biggest chance with fifa world cup champion angel di maria, who surprisingly missed the target from close range with an outside foot effort. substitute dusan vlahovic finally broke the deadlock in the th minute, just a few seconds after he stepped on the pitch. the serbia international showcased all his composure in front of goal when he beat sevilla's goalkeeper with a gentle, left-footed chip that gave his side the - lead. supported by , loud fans, sevilla immediately found the strength to come back from the disadvantage. the spanish side took six minutes to equalize the score, courtesy of former ac milan attacking midfielder suso, who fired from distance into the top-left corner. in what remained a very balanced match throughout all minutes, the tie was eventually broken in extra time. an erik lamela's header, which was too carefully placed to be within juventus goalkeeper wojciech szczesny's reach, was enough to hand sevilla a ticket to their fifth uefa europa league final in years. roma, who started on a - aggregate following a goal in the first leg by italian youngster edoardo bove, traveled to germany knowing that a tie against bayer leverkusen would suffice. the giallorossi lined up in a very organized -- system, channeling their energy on containing the opponent's attacks rather than bringing numbers forward. across the two halves, jose mourinho's men conceded a total of shots to xabi alonso's side, but they never lost composure and diligently stuck to their defensive game plan until the final whistle. their efforts eventually paid off: after nine, seemingly eternal minutes of added time, the roma players could finally scream in joy for having clinched their second european final in two years and their first uefa europa league final since . reserving a spot in the uefa champions league has proven particularly challenging this year for serie a clubs, as six of them are fiercely fighting for three available slots with only three league rounds to spare. on may , roma are scheduled to take the field against sevilla at budapest's puskas arena, but there is already great anticipation in rome among the giallorossi fans. jose mourinho's men are ready to battle it out in a game that will define their current season as well as shape the fate of the upcoming one.

(nm) what did @virgilvdijk tell cody gakpo about the club before the move? :thinking_face: -- liverpool fc (@lfc) december , psv and @lfc have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of cody gakpo. the -year-old attacker will leave for england imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. ""it is an unbelievable place to be. in my eyes, probably one of the best -- if not the best -- clubs in the world at the minute. the opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. ""obviously, i have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things i still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. i have got more to learn and the time to do that. the incredible journey continues :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:#salahstays ramsay is a red :raising_hands::red_circle: [\xavideo:\xapremier league analysis ] the reds came so close to the quadruple in - so improving this squad will not be easy but after a shaky premier league campaign so far, they need some more depth, especially in midfield. given their current owners looking for extra investment, it will be intriguing to see which direction they head in over the next few transfer windows. below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on liverpool transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. according to a report from the mirror, liverpool held talks just last week with representatives for bayern munich midfielder ryan gravenberch. the sides reportedly came to a loose agreement on contract terms for a summer move, with a transfer fee still needing to be agreed between the clubs. gravenberch joined bayern from ajax last summer, but the -year-old has reportedly grown frustrated by his lack of playing time and would like to leave this summer. also last week, liverpool pulled out of the race for jude bellingham, with a pair of starting central midfielders a high priority for jurgen klopp's side. (ae) liverpool is looking to brighton and real madrid to fix their midfield. so say the sunday papers, with spanish site revelo claiming that liverpool is ready to duel with chelsea to land alexis mac allister from brighton. and catalan site el nacional says liverpool wants to build around aurelien tchouameni, as the real star is playing but not featuring as much as expected in madrid after his move from monaco. mac allister's shown he can star in the premier league and the world cup winner won't come cheap. and might he want to stick around brighton if the seagulls and liverpool are in the same european competition or, perhaps, if brighton's in the superior competiton? as for tchouameni, you have to ask the same questions. no, he's not a nailed-on starter in a brilliant midfield behind eduardo camavinga, but he'd playing plenty at age and on a perennial champions league contender. mac allister would seem the easier and less expensive -- not my much -- lure, but watch out for chelsea who already has his world cup-winning midfield mate enzo fernandez. (nm) bayer leverkusen phenom florian wirtz is back from a major knee injury and has shown he's fit and firing, recalled back into the germany set-up. fabrizio romano says liverpool is ready to rival barcelona and real madrid for his services, while min claims that man city, arsenal, tottenham, newcastle, bayern munich, and borussia dortmund are in the chase for wirtz. wirtz, , has a contract with leverkusen through the - season and his fee will be massive should he continue to show no ill effects of his acl injury. the teenager returned to leverkusen's lineup in late january and has four assists in bundesliga play but was a thorn in the side of monaco and ferencvaros in the europa league. he scored twice with two assists in four legs between the two opponents. liverpool has a bevy of young attack-minded midfielders in harvey elliott and fabio carvalho, but wirtz is legitimately one of the most exciting prospects to come out of the bundesliga since kai havertz and timo werner came from leverkusen and stuttgart. wirtz posted goals and assists in games across all competitions in - but suffered an acl injury in late march. (nm) football insider says that liverpool could turn to wolves for a pair of midfielders including club captain ruben neves. matheus nunes is also a target for jurgen klopp, according to the site, who says liverpool faces serious neves competition from newcastle united. barcelona is also going after neves, , who could slide into the blaugranas lineup and refresh the midfield for club legend sergio busquets. barca, of course, also has teen midfield phenoms gavi and pedri, and also currently boasts dutch star frenkie de jong. (nm) carlos baleba's only been in ligue for just over a year, but he's earned his way to the wishlist of jurgen klopp and several other premier league suitors. lille resisted an ac milan bid for -year-old baleba in january, according to min.com, but the calvary is coming this summer. liverpool has been joined by arsenal, manchester united, newcastle, west ham, and leicester city in pursuit of baleba, who will cost near the $ million lille got from everton's amadou onana last summer. baleba as the joining harvey elliott and stefan bajcetic as s -- not to mention fabio carvalho -- would give klopp four midfielders under the age of . (nm) after eight years at anfield, roberto firmino will leave liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the current season. the -year-old brazilian has thus far scored goals in appearances since arriving from hoffenheim in the summer of . in his liverpool career, firmino has won the premier league, uefa champions league (twice a runner-up) and the fa cup. will mohamed salah end his anfield years if liverpool fails to make the uefa champions league? a report from fichajes says, yes, and jurgen klopp would be fine with it. yes, one of the greatest players in liverpool history could skip town this summer, with the report saying that paris saint-germain could be a destination. the ligue set could see lionel messi, neymar jr, or kylian mbappe leave paris this summer or soon afterwards. liverpool has restocked its attacking cupboard with powerful (but snakebit so far) darwin nunez and cody gakpo joining luis diaz, and diogo jota in the team. calcio mercato says that the reds could also move on from diaz if it means landing ac milan star rafael leao in a swap deal. leao, , has eight goals and six assists across matches in serie a this season, and the left winger is one of the most sought-after players in the world. would you, if you were jurgen klopp? (nm) reports out of\xagazetta dello sport and express say that liverpool's midfield rejuvenation is well underway. would he work better with inter milan's nicolo barella or bayern munich's ryan gravenberch? we may find out on at least one count. barella, , came up through the ranks at cagliari before moving to inter in . he's an elite playmaker and ball progressor who seeks to find spaces up the pitch to receive it, too. he has six goals and seven assists in appearances across all competitions this season, and he's up to caps with italy. gravenberch, , moved from ajax in the summer and has made appearances totaling minutes as of post time, scoring a goal and an assist in cup play against viktoria koln. before making the move, gravenberch was one of the most sought-after young players on the market. he's not on the same level as barella in ball movement but he's very good at creating shots and is a harder tackler and defensive presence than barella. liverpool's forward ranks have been turned over and its injury list has been long, but the reds' have been bossed in the midfield for large portions of this season and things may not be better until the summer. jurgen klopp's admitted as such, and he's known it a lot longer than real madrid's - embarrassment of his reds at anfield: his mentality monsters might still be confident but the system's not going to work without better players. in other words, you can't romanticize the relative efficiency of your club and also be mad about it, especially when a reputation is built on ""jurgen klopp doesn't miss on transfers"" but also you're missing on transfers. here are a whole lot of klopp quotes, via the liverpool echo: ""of course, we are not that dumb. it's not like, 'today is not good and now we have to change.' this is clear, it was always clear. this team has a wonderful history. the way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. our transfers always have to be on point. so that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club. ""last year was not a season for a big change. we played until the last moment. if you want to change again, this club, we can't just bring in new players and then realise later, 'oh, nobody wants to leave.' it doesn't work, it doesn't work like that. that's why it's not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. played the season until the last minute, played the champions league final. then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the world cup. ""all the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. and now we are in it and i know it's too long. for me it's too long because i have to always face you in the press conferences. believe me, i don't like to talk about it all the time. but i have to think it all the time. but that's not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because i don't have to read it the next day. that's the situation, i cannot change it. ""now the people are not happy. we try to fight through and make the best of this season, that's the idea. and stay in the period as good as a person as you can. if i said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. the more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless. ""but based on the way this club is led. it's obviously different to other clubs, that's how it is. but it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. let me say it like that. but that's something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. and for us, from my conversations with the owners. but that's it, nothing else. it's just work."" got it? no? exactly. jurgen klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that's for sure. but to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of liverpool including klopp himself. the wise money is on the weak excuse. he's one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time. it also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xga. it certainly looks like klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off father time for one more season and father time was like, ""nah."" and being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn't the worst job on earth, is it? (nm) ins cody gakpo - psv eindhoven ($ million plus incentives) outs none england midfielder mason mount reportedly wants a raise from chelsea, who is loading up on young talent amidst its season struggles to stay in the top four mix. liverpool sees a good solution for the blues: sell mount to the red part of merseyside. the reds would love to bring mount to anfield and the player has only months left on his current deal at chelsea. one thing that hasn't often been mentioned about owner todd boehly's big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue. mount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an england national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also chelsea's desire to balance their books)? juventus is also linked by the guardian and chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for mount... but just something to put onto your radar. (nm) given liverpool's struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed jude bellingham is their preferred long-term target. they probably needs neves and bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. can we see this happening? it would be pretty crazy for wolves to sell neves this month as they battle against relegation. that said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell. (jpw) liverpool manager jurgen klopp is the mouthpiece for the club, and the mouthpiece for the club would like to stop answering questions about transfers. ""it must be a language issue,"" klopp said. ""it must be, that you ask these questions again and again and again,"" he told reporters, via the liverpool echo. ""i answered it already so often. we look outside as well. it's not that we are stubborn and think, 'that's it. we'll go with these boys until .' that's not how we see it."" klopp said he forgave the reporters because he knows they are being asked by their bosses to ask about transfers. ""we are underperforming, definitely. i know that but i cannot sit here and blame everyone else. the players, it is my responsibility that they perform. it's my first concern, my first job to do. ...\xayes, we have to strengthen. oh yes, but is the right time to do it? i can't see it because of the situation we are in. ""i think i know exactly how the situation is and that's it pretty much. i can't change the answer every week because the situation doesn't change, even when we lose another game since the last press conference."" liverpool has brought in darwin nunez, cody gakpo, and fabio carvalho on permanent deals while also loaning in arthur melo. last season, they bought luis diaz and ibrahima konate. the reds looked as mixed up as a hound's breakfast in their weekend loss to brighton, a setback that klopp implied was the worst performance of his managerial career. (nm) there are reports that ruben neves' contract situation at wolves could give liverpool its latest anfield discount. somehow, the reds have been able to land players below market price rather often but this one is an easier explanation: neves only has months left on his deal and wolves may want to cash in now. neves is a sensational midfielder but wolves would potentially be risking their premier league status, though perhaps they feel julen lopetegui's system can thrive without neves. it's a no-brainer for the reds, even in klopp's money-complaint world (see update above this one). (nm) brighton and hove albion's strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the premier league, but the latter adjective makes roberto de zerbi's club vulnerable to big-money suitors. that's going to be a problem as clubs like liverpool look to strengthen in the january transfer window, and a ""liked"" instagram post by one moises caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this thursday. liverpool's said to want the ever-energetic -year-old ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by fabinho, jordan henderson, and thiago alcantara. caicedo learning from fabinho could be a match made in anfield heaven for jurgen klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from jordan henderson. the pay packet rise and champions league opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for caicedo, and this one could cost $- million less than enzo fernandez. (nm) it's official: cody gakpo is part of the anfield set. liverpool announced gakpo's arrival on wednesday with an interview on its web site, and manager jurgen klopp issued glowing praise for the dutch forward. ""there is a lot to like about cody. he is still only years old but he already has a lot of experience. he was the captain of psv, he was the player of the year in holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great world cup with his national team. so, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him."" there could hardly be a better time for this move whether you're discussing in terms of the club or the player. injuries to luis diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and gakpo certainly showed at the world cup that he's on his game. might this be the difference for the reds as they charge onward in both the premier league's top four race and the uefa champions league? more at liverpoolfc.com. (nm) what did @virgilvdijk tell cody gakpo about the club before the move? :thinking_face: -- liverpool fc (@lfc) december , his current club, psv eindhoven, have confirmed an agreement has been reached and gakpo is heading to liverpool for a medical. psv and @lfc have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of cody gakpo. the -year-old attacker will leave for england imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. -- psv (@psv) december , where would gakpo slot in at liverpool? with liverpool already having mohamed salah, darwin nunez, diogo jota and roberto firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. gakpo, nunez and diaz will be liverpool's front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. this is a surprising move by liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score plus goals a season in the premier league. just like they did with luis diaz, liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (jpw) with liverpool linked continuously with jude bellingham and the quartet of jordan henderson, james milner, fabinho and thiago alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears liverpool's main need is in central midfield. ""it's obviously a special moment for me and my family. another one that you dream of as a kid, and one i don't take for granted. ""it is an unbelievable place to be. in my eyes, probably one of the best -- if not the best -- clubs in the world at the minute. the opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. ""obviously, i have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things i still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. i have got more to learn and the time to do that. ""i think i have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. i think as a group, the sky is the limit. we want to go one, if not two, better than last season and aim for it all."" so, updating the note below... read more here the incredible journey continues :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:#salahstays -- liverpool fc (@lfc) july , liverpool are reportedly open to selling mohamed salah this summer as the egyptian star has just one year left on his current contract. the reds have been locked in talks with salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the the sun, liverpool could sell salah this summer for $ million. per the report, real madrid are the club salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on kylian mbappe and erling haaland this summer. should liverpool cash-in on salah just like they did with sadio mane earlier this week? with one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and salah has won everything he can at liverpool. with darwin nunez and luis diaz arriving over the last six months at anfield, it feels like liverpool have already made the moves to replace mane and salah long-term. now it's all about whether they sell salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. the latter option would not be good for liverpool from a business sense, especially as they've been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years. (jpw) bayern munich is claiming sadio mane as a coup for its club and league after the bundesliga champions unveiled the -year-old on wednesday. here's bayern board member hasan salihamidzic: ""in sadio mane a top international star is coming to fc bayern, who has left his mark on world football. we're proud to have brought him to munich. sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for fc bayern. everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. he will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. the fact that he's joining fc bayern shows that our club and he have big aims. sadio mane fits perfectly with the football that fc bayern play under julian nagelsmann."" (nm) the senegal star is inching closer to his move to bayern munich as he is in bavaria for his medical. mane, , will soon become a bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $ million. liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but mane leaves a legend as he scored goals in games for the reds and epitomized what they were all about under jurgen klopp. at bayern he will be the main man (robert lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with liverpool over the last six seasons. mane's incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at anfield. (jpw) -- football daily (@footballdaily) june , ""there's obviously a pathway here - that's one of the reasons i chose it as well. it's not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,"" ramsay said. ""so if i can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there's no reason why i can't push to get in the first-team squad."" ramsay has been sensational for aberdeen in the scottish premiership and is a scotland u international already. he will have his work cut-out to replace taa at right back but perhaps his arrival will allow the alexander-arnold to move further forward or even play in central midfield? (jpw) ramsay is a red :raising_hands::red_circle: -- liverpool fc (@lfc) june , liverpool is awaiting a fresh bid from bayern munich for star winger sadio mane, as reports claim the senegalese has agreed to terms with germany's serial champions. mane, , has been linked to bayern for some time and fabrizio romano says that it'll be a three-year contract for the forward. liverpool manager jurgen klopp is excited by the potential of his latest massive purchase, especially because possible nine-figure striker darwin nunez is already very, very good. ""darwin is a wonderful player; already really good but so much potential to get even better,"" klopp said. ""that's why it's so exciting, to be honest. his age, his desire, his hunger to be even better than he currently is. his belief in our project and what we are looking to do as a club."" read more about the league cup and fa cup winners' latest big cash splash, here (nm). darwin nunez to liverpool looks to be close to completion, as the uruguayan ace is reportedly on his way to anfield. liverpool paid southampton $ million to acquire virgil van dijk. benfica's asking price for nunez is said to start at $ million, with manchester united and atletico madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee. reports out of portugal say that liverpool has met that $ million fee. (nm) liverpool were reportedly one of three clubs in the final running for aurelien tchouameni, but the -year-old monaco midfielder is likely headed to real madrid after the reigning european champions got the best of the reds once more. it'll be $ million upfront, with the remaining $ million available through add-ons. (ae) bayern munich reportedly offered $ million (plus $ million in add-ons) for sadio mane, but the bundesliga giants were quickly turned away by liverpool. bayern will no doubt be back with another offer, though they hope to cap their costs at around $ million.

(ae) july - kalvin phillips completes man city move england international midfielder kalvin phillips has switched his boyhood club leeds for manchester city, as the move costs an initial $. million. phillips is the long-term replacement for fernandinho and will add steel, creativity and class to city's engine room. this seems like a very good fit for pep guardiola and the transfer fee is pretty decent too. perhaps that was impacted by phillips having a rough - season as he spent most of it out injured. regardless of those struggles, the yorkshire pirlo has an incredible range of passing and he should slot in very nicely alongside rodri to give city's stable of wonderful attacking players plenty of license to roam free. phillips, , is joining city in his prime and guardiola will no doubt take his game to the next level. this is a very good deal for city and phillips. (jpw) july - man city add goalkeeper ahead of steffen loan usmnt goalkeeper zack steffen was expected to leave manchester city on loan this season should the citizens find a home for him. the out-of-contract -year-old starred for arminia bielefeld in the bundesliga but saw the club relegated as he finished out his contract. (nm) it comes as little to surprise to hear that new burnley manager vincent kompany would look to man city in a bid to boost the clarets back to the premier league. city will send highly-rated center back taylor harwood-bellis, , on a season-long loan to turf moor, while cj egan-riley moves to the clarets on a permanent deal. england u- back harwood-bellis started double-digit games for kompany's anderlecht last season and then went to stoke city, where ran up almost , minutes in the championship over a half-season. he's played eight times for city, scoring a goal against port vale in the fa cup. egan-riley, , is also an england youth international and made three senior appearances for man city last season. june - arsenal, man city agree transfer fee for gabriel jesus following the departures of pierre-emerick aubameyang and alexandre lacazette in january and the summer, respectively, arsenal appear to have filled their massive hole at striker with a -year-old (four-time) premier league champion: gabriel jesus. fabricio romano reported on friday that arsenal and manchester city have agreed a $. million transfer fee for the brazilian international. all that remains to be agreed are personal terms for a contract between jesus and arsenal. (ae) deal depends on zack steffen to find a good solution on the market, but ortega's waiting for city. -- erling haaland (@erlinghaaland) june , follow @nicholasmendola fernandinho, oleksandr zinchenko and joao cancelo are out the door, while erling haaland, julian alvarez, and maximo perrone have arrived at the etihad stadium since the summer. [\xavideo:\xapremier league analysis\xa] will the new pieces help man city keep hold of the premier league and chase down the final jewel in its infinity gauntlet, the champions league title? and who will city chase in the future as a few positions look in need of a refresh under pep guardiola? [ transfer news: liverpool | chelsea | tottenham | man united\xa| arsenal ] below we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on manchester city transfer news as joe prince-wright (jpw), nicholas mendola (nm) and andy edwards (ae) will guide you through a hectic next few months. sky sports reports that a deal for bellingham, still until june, is ""not done yet"" because bellingham's agent/father is savvy operator and ""always has irons in the fire."" it also reports that bellingham could be in advance talks with other clubs as well, so there's a grain of salt in this one, but we're going to share the buzz any time a possible $m+ player could be on the verge of a move. bellingham rates high in pretty much all metrics. the attack agile midfielder in an elite class at his position for interceptions and blocks, and is a willing and tremendous ball carrier. (nm) bayer leverkusen phenom florian wirtz is wanted by any of number of teams now that he's healed from a serious knee injury. man city's in the fight for wirtz's services, according to min, where it will jostle with barcelona, liverpool, real madrid, arsenal, tottenham, newcastle, bayern munich, and borussia dortmund amongst others. wirtz, , has a contract with leverkusen through the - season and his fee will be astronomical should he continue to show his injury hasn't changed much about him. the teenager returned to leverkusen's lineup in late january and has four assists in bundesliga play but was a thorn in the side of monaco and ferencvaros in the europa league. he scored twice with two assists in four legs between the two opponents. wirtz was electric as a -year-old regular in -, but really found his footing last season. wirtz posted goals and assists in games across all competitions in - but suffered an acl injury in late march.(nm) it takes very little time watching newcastle united to see that bruno guimaraes is the straw that stirs the midfield drink for eddie howe. and it isn't often that pep guardiola is linked with a big-money buy these days that doesn't at least have a strong helping of truth in it. bruno running man city's midfield just kinda makes sense, as much as it might drive newcastle insane to consider guimaraes lining up with kevin de bruyne, rodri, phil foden and company. a report says guimaraes would be a target and guardiola could overhaul city by selling aymeric laporte and bernardo silva in addition to letting ilkay gundogan walk. silva and gundogan have been linked with barcelona, while lavia's future -- as detailed below -- is still in city's hands. is there smoke here? it certainly sounds logical enough, especially if newcastle doesn't land a place in the champions league. but newcastle's rise has been special for the players in the fold, and guimaraes may love the idea of continuing down the road of becoming a club legend. (nm) romeo lavia has impressed in a massive way since leaving manchester city for southampton last summer, reportedly sending tongues wagging at arsenal, chelsea, and manchester united. but hold on, folks: man city inserted a buyback clause in this summer's sale and may leap to the front of the queue after lavia's strong showings for saints. that said, this all probably hinges on whether southampton stays up, because lavia is still growing as a player and the pl minutes at st. mary's have done him well. city's not stopping restocking whether from within or without, as maximo perrone fits a similar profile to lavia and was brought into the fold this january. lavia's proven an aggressive tackler and defender but city would likely be buying back a player to block him from other suitors. (nm) chelsea wrecking ball mateo kovacic will enter the final months of his contract this summer, and multiple reports say city wants to bring the croatian midfielder aboard. the former dinamo zagreb, inter milan, and real madrid player has caps for croatia and is an elite ball mover in the midfield. his expected assists and shot-creating actions are also impressive, and you can imagine his actual assists would be higher on a normal year of finishing for chelsea. this makes sense for man city, but what about chelsea? normally you wouldn't see the blues selling anyone to a rival, especially one set for centurion status at croatia and still in his prime, but given the money chelsea's spent under new boss todd boehly... maybe this helps balance the books a bit. but selling jorginho and kovacic in the same six-month span? wild. (nm) could fulham's antonee robinson be on the move to a european club even if fulham do not quality for the europa league? football insider says newcastle united, manchester city, and ac milan are clubs who very much like the self-glossed ""jedi,"" who has thrived for club and country this year. robinson, , nearly moved to ac milan in the january window two seasons ago but a since-resolved heart issue scuppered the move at the rd hour. would he leap at the chance to go to europe despite a great relationship with club captain and fellow usmnt back tim ream? robinson is about to hit his prime if he isn't in it already, and the everton alum might have eyes for the opportunity (nm). ins maximo perrone - velez sarsfield ($ million) outs joao cancelo - bayern munich (loan with $ million buy option) what a wild move, as pep guardiola sanctions the loan of joao cancelo to bayern munich with the option to buy in the summer. pep will be riding with rico lewis, nathan ake, sergio gomez, and kyle walker at fullback for the remainder of the season unless he makes an addition today. -- fc bayern munich (@fcbayernen) january , joao cancelo has only fallen out of favor with pep guardiola in recent weeks, but the portuguese left back is set to depart manchester city for bayern munich. cancelo's move to the -time bundesliga champions will be a loan initially, with a $-million option to buy in the summer. (ae) man city transfer rumors have had a ""where there's smoke, there's fire"" feel over the past few windows, so it's no surprise to see maximo perrone quickly going from reported target to man city player. we reported last week that his reported release clause would be triggered by man city but there was some question whether velez sarsfield would find a way to stand in the way of his move. perrone is a fine reader of the game who is also not afraid of a tackle. an excellent dribbler and play driver, perrone should learn plenty from both rodri and kevin de bruyne (amongst others). (nm) welcome, maximo! :blue_heart:#mancity -- manchester city (@mancity) january , manchester city boss pep guardiola has an apparent interest in a january move for -year-old velez sarsfield star maximo perrone, at least according to the argentine club's president. velez boss sergio rapisarda is less than pleased with city, however. what will he do if perrone's reported meager $ million release clause is triggered by city? the youngster's played almost , minutes this season and is coached at the u- level by longtime pep pal javier mascherano. if two of barcelona's best see you as a good prospect, well, connect\xathose dots without much reservation. ""the boy, he wants to go,"" rapisarda said.

(ae) the left back below is going to city, as man city announced the capture of anderlecht's sergio gomez on a four-year deal. as expected, the vincent kompany connection was huge to the deal. ""it was a pride working with him from the first day. i used to watch manchester city when i was younger and he was the captain of the team. he was a role model for everybody. to me, it was an honour working with him and i'm very grateful to him for everything that happened last season at anderlecht.

season (though fortuna was relegated). deal depends on zack steffen to find a good solution on the market, but ortega's waiting for city. -- fabrizio romano (@fabrizioromano) june , -- erling haaland (@erlinghaaland) june , follow @nicholasmendola harry kane has goals on the season and a lead of five on the closest competitor behind him on the premier league goals list this season.key words: behind him. because no one's ever scored more goals in a -game premier league season than manchester city's erling haaland.haaland scored his rd goal of the season in a -

""fulham fc, marco silva and aleksandar mitrovic have been sanctioned by an independent regulatory commission following a hearing in relation to their tie against manchester united in the fa cup on sunday march. ""we claimed the standard punishment which would otherwise apply to aleksandar mitrovic for the sending-off offence of violent conduct that he committed towards the match referee around the nd minute was clearly insufficient. the forward denied this, but it was upheld by the regulatory commission, and a three-match ban was imposed. this is in addition to the three-match ban he had already received for the red card offence. ""the forward separately admitted that his behaviour and language after being sent off was improper, abusive, insulting and threatening, and the regulatory commission imposed an additional two-match ban and PS, fine. in total, the regulatory commission has suspended aleksandar mitrovic for eight matches. one of these has already been served, and therefore the forward will be unavailable for fulham fc's next seven matches. the english football association released the following statement on the bans handed out by the independent regulatory commission, as they will appeal the sanctions and want lengthier bans for both. as things stand, mitrovic will next be available to play for fulham away at southampton on may , while silva will at least miss their games against west ham and everton over the next two weekends. -- fa spokesperson (@faspokesperson) april , follow @nicholasmendola harry kane has goals on the season and a lead of five on the closest competitor behind him on the premier league goals list this season.key words: behind him. because no one's ever scored more goals in a -game premier league season than manchester city's erling haaland.haaland scored his rd goal of the season in a -

"for all the improvements erik ten hag brings to manchester united, there remains a soft centre. their record away from home against top opposition could prove costly in the race for the champions league. though newcastle united did not blow ten hag's team away like liverpool did last month, they were deserved, easy victors. ten hag might look to the steel in midfield that was the core of newcastle's win, with bruno guimaraes outstanding and sean longstaff supplying artisanship and exertion alongside him. it was not a gala sunday afternoon for the bruno fernandes fan club, and casemiro was again glaringly missed, even if he was among the guilty at anfield. ten hag's late readjustment of his team, removing centre-backs to go for broke, backfired as callum wilson scored soon after. it is difficult to imagine howe taking such high-risk gambles. his reward was revenge for wembley and a tighter command of that top-four objective. john brewin match report: newcastle - manchester united match report: arsenal - leeds for a final act, graham potter's invoking of ""expected goals"" after a deflating defeat was typically downbeat. in defending chelsea's poor record from corners this, he described john mcginn's decisive strike: ""if you look at the xg, it's probably not that big a chance."" true enough, mcginn's was a well-taken, high-tariff chance from a player without an aston villa goal in months. but despite xg as a metric having gone overground on match of the day, it still met with fury, mostly because came as part of a series of glib, unconvincing explanations. that such xg talk recalled nathan jones' doomed southampton reign was doubly unfortunate. ""clearly we need to improve, you only have to look at the league table to see that,"" potter offered in characteristically flat tones in what proved his epitaph. elite managers, specifically chelsea managers, need to offer more. being a convincing, charismatic frontman is part of the job. and so is winning matches. john brewin match report: chelsea - aston villa virgil van dijk revealed that with liverpool down in eighth and playing chelsea, arsenal and leeds in the next eight days, jurgen klopp had called a team meeting. ""the turnaround is quite quick, with chelsea on tuesday. [this was a] tough afternoon, definitely. very frustrated. that's the feeling."" even more so as it was a third straight loss since eviscerating manchester united -. ""we're trying to kick on,"" dijk said. ""the first-half was quite even, obviously a fantastic goal by mo [salah], they scored a good goal as well."" despite the seven points to tottenham the defender believes a champions league berth remains possible. ""let's regroup and focus on chelsea,"" he said. jamie jackson match report: manchester city - liverpool match report: brighton - brentford match report: nottingham forest - wolves kick off your evenings with the guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion monday night sees a battle of the premier league's crisis clubs. though such things are relative. antonio conte departed tottenham via ryanair without a backwards glance, fabio paratici joining him in fifa-imposed exile but matters are far more existential at everton. sean dyche's team ended the weekend in the relegation zone following a week where it was reported the club's new stadium project is dropping behind schedule. that followed the publication of accounts made up to june revealing losses of PS.m, and mentioning a reliance on owner farhad moshiri's funding for ""the group's ability to continue as a going concern"". dark times might be darker yet without last summer's PSm sale of richarlison to tottenham. how everton have missed brazil's first-choice no striker, still to score a premier league goal for spurs. that former partner dominic calvert-lewin has scored just once tells something else of an everton season lurching towards disaster. john brewin pep guardiola's decision to dispense with joao cancelo in january, after a reported clash with the full-back, was seen by many as somewhat baffling and by many more as a symptom of the coach's blinkered self-regard. twelve games, nine wins and five clean sheets later, the move suddenly seems a lot less silly. cancelo is sensational creative player but his last starts for city threw up four defeats and a red card, plus another three bookings. factor in a dodgy character reference, and guardiola judged that the trade-off wasn't worth it. for a team with hardly short of extravagant riches going forward, it seems a fair verdict, and two goals conceded in a recent seven-game winning streak is vindication, at least for now. guardiola's new-look back three kept liverpool at bay with ease on saturday and the newly reupholstered defence has taken little away from the team's sharp end, where goals have now been dispatched in three games. cancelo, now of bayern munich, could at least console himself by watching his new team go top of the bundesliga that evening ... from the comfort of the subs' bench. alex hess match report: west ham - southampton manor solomon made a slow start to his fulham career, injuring his knee in august and spending the rest of recuperating. but after since coming back in the new year, he's been a strong influence on his team, scoring in five consecutive games - a run that included some lovely finishes - and generally adding improvisational imagination and chutzpah to a team that has scored fewer times than any other top- side save aston villa. and though his team lost disappointingly at the weekend, he again caught the eye, putting in a proper shift supporting antonee robinson, as well as showcasing his usual deft touch and soft feet. it may be that, at the end of the season, solomon returns to shakhtar donetsk, but given the general way of things, it seems more likely he remains at craven cottage - and the good news for fulham is that, at , he has plenty of scope for improvement. daniel harris match report: bournemouth - fulham""}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-04-03T07:00:43Z

" chelsea have sacked graham potter: so where did it all go wrong? fft\'s adam clery takes a closer look at why this was doomed from the very beginning chelsea have sacked graham potter with around PS million spent in the transfer market this season along and the blues in the bottom half of the table. it\'s a mess, as fft\'s adam clery points out in the video above (opens in new tab). todd boehly was supposed to be the anti-abramovich, hiring a new manager who was going to oversee a long-term vision and looking to a brighter, more progressive style of play. roman abramovich never sacked two coaches in the same season, though. and given that chelsea paid brighton & hove albion a whole PSm to part with potter last september, that\'s around PSm per month in charge. it wasn\'t long ago that the former full-back was being touted as england\'s brightest young boss and being touted for the three lions job one day. chelsea experimented with formations, as adam points out in the video. there was a back three to start his tenure before a ---, a --- and a ---. ""and then the transfer window happens,"" adam notes, ""and chelsea go absolutely bananas.""

" ""chelsea have not placed luis enrique among the leading candidates for the permanent head coach job as the club start to cut down their shortlist and prepare for a new round of talks. enrique flew to london two weeks ago for discussions with chelsea but there are no further talks planned with the former barcelona man, which could leave the path clear for tottenham hotspur to make their move. along with sporting's ruben amorim, enrqiue is now rated as an outsider for the chelsea post with initial contact thought to have been made with all the main contenders - including julian nagelsmann and mauricio pochettino. chelsea are expected to hold further talks with nagelsmann, who was interviewed last week, and pochettino, along with other coaches, with club sources still insistent there is not yet a favourite or single leading contender for the post. nagelsmann is believed to have impressed chelsea during his interview but, despite outside sources and some players believing he is the most likely permanent successor to graham potter, insiders have rejected any notion that the german is emerging as the favourite yet. former tottenham manager pochettino was interviewed by chelsea and impressed co-controlling owners todd boehly and behdad eghbali before they appointed potter. he is still available, having been out of work since being sacked by paris st-germain. as disclosed by telegraph sport, tottenham have made moves to contact enrique and it appears the north london club might have a clear run at him with chelsea's attention focused more vividly elsewhere. chairman daniel levy has previously expressed reservations over enrique's lack of premier league experience, but the spaniard has been highly recommended to spurs and is on the club's shortlist of candidates to permanently succeed antonio conte. despite their elimination from the champions league, the chelsea job is still rated as one of the most attractive in europe, but boehly and eghbali know they cannot afford to get their next appointment wrong. boehly and eghbali have already sacked thomas tuchel and potter, and put frank lampard in caretaker charge until the end of the season, inside months. but, following the champions league defeat by real madrid, defender thiago silva warned: ""everybody talks too much about replacing managers. i think we, as players, must also take responsibility. ""we have had three managers this season, plus a fourth with bruno where we failed to win. we have lost today and with lampard, we have failed to win. everybody is talking about the manager but we must look at what has been done wrong and try to change. ""i think the first step has been made; an incorrect step, but it has been made. we can't be blaming the managers if we don't take responsibility. it's a hard period for the club, with a lot of indecision. ""change of ownership, new players arriving - we had to increase the size of the changing room because it didn't fit the size of the squad. ""a positive point is that there are amazing players in the squad, but on the other hand there are always players that are going to be unhappy. there is always going to be someone upset because not everyone can play. the manager can only pick from a squad of -something - that's tough. chelsea's champions league exit has left some players facing the prospect of pay cuts of up to per cent, while others will not see their wages immediately hit by a failure to qualify for the competition should they stay at the club. the boehly-clearlake capital owners introduced a bonus system after buying chelsea from roman abramovich, who only paid bonuses for winning trophies and did not include champions league reduction clauses in contracts. having spent PS million in the past two transfer windows, the move to insert champions league clauses will help offset some of the costs of not playing in europe's top competition, although some of the cuts may be deferred past next season. big earners from the abramovich era include kepa arrizabalaga, kai havertz, mateo kovacic, hakim ziyech, christian pulisic and n'golo kante, who has been in negotiations over an extension to his contract past the end of this season. two weeks removed from spraining his right knee, sixers star joel embiid scored just points in a series-tying - loss to the celtics in game of the eastern conference semifinals. bosa will play for his third different defensive coordinator in five years with the ers. he's not worried about it affecting his game.

" the premier league season came to an end on sunday, with everton staying up at the expense of leicester and leeds. it was a season with engaging battles for the title, european places and relegation. but it was a strange season, too. we should be used to anything after the year of covid-era football with seasons ending in july - and empty stadiums. but we did have another break this season for a winter world cup, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. bbc sport takes a look at some of the unusual things to happen this season... this was a season of unprecedented managerial overhauls, with changes in total. chelsea, leeds and southampton sacked two managers each. including caretakers and interims, several of whom were chopped and changed, people took charge of at least one premier league game this season. only one of the managers - graham potter going from brighton to chelsea - left out of choice. and he ended up being two of the changes as he was sacked by chelsea after less than seven months. only nine of the premier league teams ended the season with the same manager who started it. all three relegated teams - leicester, leeds and southampton - ended the season with short-term managers whose deals have expired. chelsea are set to appoint mauricio pochettino to replace stop-gap frank lampard, who started the season as everton boss. roy hodgson and ryan mason are out of contract at crystal palace and tottenham respectively. chelsea\'s - season will live long in the memory, but not for the right reasons. the blues finished in the bottom half (th) for the first time since -, but that is barely half the story. since todd boehly took over as owner at the end of last season, they have spent PSm on players and had four different managers (including interims) this season. the PSm+ spent in january and PSm splurged in the summer are two of the three biggest transfer window spends ever - with real madrid\'s PSm in the summer of in between. boehly sacked champions league-winning manager thomas tuchel before appointing potter on a five-year deal and paying PSm compensation for him and his coaching staff. seven months later, potter was sacked and his deputy bruno saltor took interim charge. he was given one game before boehly brought back lampard - the man who had been sacked a couple of years ago, leading to tuchel\'s arrival. they only won once in his -game spell. tuchel, meanwhile, ended the season winning the bundesliga with bayern munich. and pochettino is now on his way to stamford bridge. for all the managerial changes, it was a big surprise steve cooper was not one of them. he was widely expected to be sacked when forest were bottom after eight games, but instead he got a new contract. in april, he was again rumoured to be on the brink but forest issued a club statement saying he would remain in charge. it worked in the end as forest stayed up, with all four teams below them changing managers. this season we all - well, not the teams involved - enjoyed a really open relegation tussle. on march, the bottom nine clubs were separated by just four points with or games to go. crystal palace, in th, had points. southampton, who were bottom, had . eventually teams started to pull away - and southampton stayed where they were - but it was still the first season since - that no team were relegated after games. two of the teams down there changed managers after the end of march - and both went down. leicester hired dean smith, and leeds turned to sam allardyce and karl robinson, with the pair thought to be on deals with huge bonuses if they stayed up. leeds\' money was safe. by the final day it was between everton, leicester and leeds for the final two relegation places - with abdoulaye doucoure keeping the toffees up with the only goal against bournemouth. referees\' body pgmol spent more time than it would want apologising for video assistant referee mistakes. on one saturday in february, it said sorry to brighton and arsenal for separate games. in one, the var did not draw the offside lines; in the other they drew them from the same player. in september, again on the same weekend, pgmol acknowledged newcastle and west ham had goals against crystal palace and chelsea respectively wrongly disallowed by the var for fouls. there are not always apologies for mistakes - and apologies are not always public - so there is no way to know how prevalent it is. but we do know brighton have had three apologies. after rounds of games, there were incorrect var interventions, missed interventions and var errors for on-field offences. there were correct interventions during that time. that\'s not even mentioning liverpool defender andy robertson claiming he was elbowed by an assistant referee and reds boss jurgen klopp injuring his hamstring after shouting at a fourth official. by the end of the season, pgmol chief howard webb gave his time to sky sports and bbc radio live to explain some of the mistakes. clubs had about six weeks without premier league games from mid-november to december because the world cup in qatar took place in europe\'s winter. some teams gave players who were not going to the world cup anywhere between a few days to a couple of weeks off, while other teams flew to the other side of the world. the united arab emirates, australia, saudi arabia, spain and portugal were some of the destinations - with about half of the premier league teams playing friendlies during that time. liverpool and arsenal played games in the dubai super cup, everton were in the sydney cup, crystal palace hosted brazilian side botafogo, a few teams faced la liga clubs and fulham even hosted west ham in a london derby the week before christmas. the table looked quite different then, with arsenal top at christmas, chelsea only off the european places on goal difference and wolves bottom. and cristiano ronaldo was a manchester united player. the amount of world cup players did not seem to have a detrimental effect on the second half of the season. a league-high of manchester city\'s squad went to qatar and they won the title, while only two southampton players, a joint low, did and they sank to the bottom. for much of the season, it looked as though arsenal were going to win their first title since the \'invincibles\' of -. arsenal were eight points above city - albeit having played a game more - coming into april. they topped the table for games in total. but they suffered the same fate liverpool have in recent years and were unable to keep up city\'s relentless winning form in the second half of the campaign. mikel arteta\'s side spent days top - the most without finishing first in english top-flight history - yet city wrapped up the title with three games to go. since guardiola took over in , city have taken between and points in their final games of a premier league season - an average of . points per game. city have been favourites to win the league every year since -, with arsenal starting the campaign at - sixth favourites. premier league champions city now turn their sights to the treble. they face manchester united in the fa cup final and inter milan in the champions league final in the next two saturdays. win both and they become the second team to win all three after united in -. revelatory documentary detailing life in the jewish hasidic breslov community in israel greg jenner and his ""suspects"" take a forensic look at the world-famous novelist agatha christie spotlight investigates how failings in secret surveillance were exposed \'the phenomenal\' aj styles talks about his career in wwe adam peaty discusses his struggles with depression, explaining the effects it has had on his life as a family man and as an elite swimmer. everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment. the latest rumours and stories from around the world of football. analysis and opinion from our chief football writer. how to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the uk.'}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-05-28T19:53:27Z

"untold arsenal: supporting the club, the manager and the team ""i believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art."" a wenger by tony attwood i've noted several times that arsenal have one of the youngest squads in the league - a situation which combined with the success this season (compared to recent years) suggests the future is rather bright. but it does bring with it a few problems such as the fact the media, and their story suppliers (mostly the agents of players) get quite agitated about ""new contracts for the players, or else he'll be off"".\xa \xa in fact, as far as i can tell, most of the rumours that circulate about players going hither and thither, are make-believe created by agents for a gullible media which wants copy without journalistic activity. but occasionally of course the stories are true - often by pure chance and generally only two or three percent of them.\xa take xhaka leaving, for example.\xa his departure is everywhere as a story, but is it because a bid has been put in and everyone agrees, or xhaka's agent is aiming to get his man a new arsenal contract? and he's not the only one of course "" players leaving arsenal alongside granit xhaka as gunners exodus gets underway"" shouts the mirror.\xa but we're ok because,\xa""arsenal manager mikel arteta is braced.""\xa whatever that means. the main thrust of the stories is as it usually is. if it is an arsenal player wanting to leave arsenal are useless at doing anything to stop this.\xa but if it is a player arsenal want to buy then all the power is with the selling club, as in arsenal suffer declan rice blow as west ham set deadline for talks. oh yes and all the time ""arteta is desperate""\xa \xaso while arsenal players can be pinched at knock down prices, the players the club wants are expensive and no discounts are on offer. and while arsenal management laze around, everyone else is on red alert (whatever that actually means in practice).\xa so kieran tierney is going to newcastle.\xa any moment now we will hear that his injuries have been because of arsenal's hopeless training methods. also off is emile smith rowe because arteta won't play him, oh yes and arsenal are running into ffp difficulties so need to off-load players.\xa \xastrange that no one really got into manchester city suffering ffp difficulties over the years, although to be fair in that case (allegedly) they massaged the books and none of these inquisitive journalists noticed. reiss nelson is also going (for nothing), and just when we thought that folarin balogun would be joining arsenal, ac milan appear to be about to nick him away.\xa but nicolas pepe will definitely be back at arsenal. cedric soares is about to leave as well, we are told, and pablo mari is off to monza on a permanent deal.\xa \xaand saliba could be off because he is coming into the last year of his contract and there is still no deal in place. and just to reiterate the point, every single one of these tales comes from a single mirror article! one thing is clear, the mirror, like the rest, didn't come out of the january window with any credibility, so whatever they say about this summer is much more likely to be wrong, than right.\xa normally % wrong, % right. yawn, yawn, yawn. media, media, media... \t\t\t\t\ttheme by seos themes'}",mykhaylo mudryk,en,2023-05-17T07:33:06Z

"julien laurens explains why there was only one choice for espn fc\'s top u star. (:) the world\'s best male players are getting younger, but is it finally time to crown successors to the legendary lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo? for the fifth straight year (read , , and here), espn brings you our list of the game\'s next top young stars aged or under. now , last year\'s no. erling haaland is too old to be included, while some others from \'s top -- phil foden, vinicius junior and alphonso davies -- are also over the age requirement, too. many of this year\'s crop have made their mark on the big stage already, but who has done enough to land a place on espn\'s list, what are their particular qualities and how can they get even better? collating the list for the fourth year running is tor-kristian karlsen, who has worked as a scout and executive for clubs across europe, including monaco, zenit and watford. he explains his methodology before revealing his picks. - stream on espn+: laliga, bundesliga, more (u.s.) why ? for the past two years, has worked well, and from an initial long list of players, those remaining are the ones who best satisfied my main criteria: appearances at the highest level, consistent performance over a sustained period and the potential to develop into a future top-level footballer. what types of research were undertaken? i used a sounding board consisting of professional scouts and sporting directors from several top european clubs before deciding on the final ranking, as well as some online scouting platforms. personal preference also played a role. is there a reason that attacking players dominate the list? in general, forwards get more playing time at a younger age than, say, central defenders, who tend to need more time to develop tactical awareness, positioning and understanding of the game. beyond those who did make it, other defenders considered included benfica\'s antonio silva, atalanta\'s giorgio scalvini and soon-to-be tottenham full-back destiny udogie. it speaks volumes about the array of attacking talent that players such as rb leipzig\'s benjamin sesko, arsenal\'s folarin balogun, leeds united\'s wilfried gnonto, newcastle\'s anthony gordon, and -year-old palmeiras prodigy endrick (who is to join real madrid in for EUR million) didn\'t make the final cut. notes: - players included must be age or under on april . - transfer values are taken from transfermarkt. - positions are: gk (goalkeeper), lb (left-back), rb (right-back), cb (centre-back), dm (defensive midfield), cm (central midfield), am (attacking midfield), fw (forward), st (striker.) club/country: sporting cp/uruguay age: estimated transfer value: EURm one of the most rapidly improving midfielders in portugal, ugarte has seen his stock rise over recent months and was part of uruguay\'s squad for the world cup. whereas the majority of up-and-coming south american talent habitually originate from prestigious academies, the -year-old has made it the hard way through smaller clubs (uruguayan side fenix and famalicao in portugal) before joining sporting cp in august . strengths: his career offers some clues about ugarte\'s mentality: he\'s determined, hard-working and focused on improving the weaker aspects of his game. an irrepressible ball winner, he attempts a stunning seven tackles per minutes (at a success rate of %) and swiftly looks to press opponents and close gaps. technically he\'s a master of the basics with tidy control, a solid short-to-long passing range and an absence of anything flashy. he is intelligent, often finding the right option after regaining possession, and plays to his strengths. how he can improve: despite not being a natural playmaker, his passing in the face of a low block from the opposition can be on the predictable side. as a by-product of his tenacity, his frequent fouling (. fouls per minutes) leads to numerous bookings and he will need to curb that to avoid suspension. club/country: borussia dortmund/united states age: estimated transfer value: EURm three years on from making his bundesliga debut at the age of , many would have expected the american to be further down the line in terms of development. while injuries have played their part, lack of confidence and controversies over his standing for the usmnt may also explain reyna\'s start-stop career trajectory. strengths: before a drop in playing time in the middle of february, reyna enjoyed an impactful spell in which his creativity in front of the opposing defensive line was in evidence. along with his opportunism in the box and excellent right-footed shot when cutting in from the left, he is able to unlock defences and create chances for his teammates. how he can improve: while reyna\'s skill set hasn\'t evaporated, what was previously demonstrated on a weekly basis now tends only come in moments. the daring dribbles in the final third and sharp combination play that set him apart early in his career are yet to fully return. whether it requires a lift in energy, attitude or self-belief, reyna must regain the trust of his club head coach, edin terzic. club/country: borussia monchengladbach/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: usually fielded as the more defensive-minded midfielder in a double pivot, kone provides balance in the centre of the pitch. with his athleticism, work rate and discipline, he covers large areas, presses and protects his centre-backs. in possession, he is adept at advancing with the ball with both speed and dexterity. hard to dispossess, he is also nimble and able to successfully negotiate his way out of congested areas. how he can improve: kone is not a playmaker, but his passing can appear overly cautious. his aggressive style and full-bodied commitment also leads to unnecessary frequent bookings. club/country: liverpool/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: energetic, lively and light-footed, the england u international presses with intent and opens up space with his movement. on the ball he adds to the fluidity of the game by way of instinctive touches, directness in his passing and excellent dribbling abilities. his left foot -- though underused from set-pieces and long-distance shooting -- is of a high standard, too. how he can improve: in addition to his inconsistent defensive contribution and his physical shortcomings in terms of strength and height, elliott should be attempting to beat opponents in central areas to a higher degree -- especially since he\'s so good at it. given his creativity and intelligence, one expects a higher input than his five goals and two assists from games this season. club/country: valencia/united states age: estimated transfer value: EURm a key player for the usmnt at the world cup, musah has lacked consistency in a struggling valencia side in laliga. on the whole, though, he\'s making progress: his playing time has been increasing and he recently put in one of his best performances of the season in a - home win against osasuna. how he can improve: being such an influential, progressive and active midfielder -- especially from his central position -- upping his attacking game would add another dimension, as he has yet to score in laliga this season. club/country: lyon/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm the prodigal talent is experiencing his best run of form after breaking into the lyon first team two years ago. now, under laurent blanc\'s stewardship, cherki tends to stay on the pitch for the duration of matches and has added maturity and consistency to his game. strengths: technically superb with an array of footwork trickery, quick turns and body feints, cherki has often been considered a player who can only express his skills in the final third. but this season there\'s a lot more end product to his game: he releases the ball to teammates quicker, his passing game has become more progressive and, with some extra muscle, appears harder to knock of the ball. equally skilled with either foot, the playmaker (who manages . key passes per minutes) can create things in any role behind the centre-forward. club/country: nottingham forest/wales age: estimated transfer value: EURm despite a slow start to his premier league career, the wales international is starting to answer his critics who doubted whether he\'d be able to cut it at the highest level. while he initially struggled to get to grips with higher tactical demands and better defenders in the top flight, his upturn in performances for forest has been impressive. strengths: with an outstanding ability to run with the ball at high speed, johnson thrives in transition or when the game opens up. regardless of his position wide right or as a central attacker, he prefers to drift and exploit the space between opposing centre-back and full-back. though he is naturally right-footed, he is able to take on opponents with both feet and finish with power. how he can improve: johnson can opt for an individual move instead of taking an extra second to look for a better-placed teammate. in his enthusiasm to get things done quickly, the precision in his short passing and lay-offs also suffers. club/country: borussia dortmund/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm it took the germany international some time to settle into the bundesliga following his EURm move from fc salzburg in the summer, but he has shown his potential. after scoring in four consecutive matches for the title chasers, he picked up a muscle injury in mid-february which is likely to rule him out until early april. strengths: his goal against chelsea in the champions league showcased his strong points: pace, dribbling and skill in one-vs.-one situations. breaking from a defensive corner, adeyemi set off on a run from the edge of his own box, picked up the ball with meters left to cover before bursting past enzo fernandez with a quick change of pace and playing the ball calmly behind an outmanoeuvred kepa in the chelsea goal. in addition to the acceleration, effortless running style and fine technical ability, adeyemi is also an instinctive finisher -- especially with his left foot -- with a penchant for improvisation (as proven a couple of days later with his backheeled opener against hertha berlin.) how he can improve: at times his tremendous pace can come at the expense of ball control. his insistence on taking on opponents, even when the situation calls for a supportive pass, can force him into blind alleys and he can lose possession. club/country: villarreal/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm last season, yeremy provided memorable moments aplenty and was rewarded with his first senior spain cap. this campaign has been a slower start and while he might struggle to match last term\'s six-goal haul (he has three at the time of writing), he\'s shown himself to be a big-game player by getting on the scoresheet in the wins against real madrid and atletico. strengths: alternating between starting positions on either wing, the quick and nimble forward is capable of providing width in attack or setting off on rapid diagonal runs towards central areas. in addition to possessing fine attributes for a winger -- excellent dribbling skills, acceleration from a standing position, innate interchanges and smart runs -- yeremy also has the vision to put in penetrative passes through the middle. he doesn\'t go to sleep when out of possession either; he is committed to his pressing and, despite his -foot- frame, is surprisingly strong in aerial duels. how he can improve: in short, he needs to score more goals. considering his mobility and intelligence, he could sharpen his attacking involvement, as he can be prone to drift in and out of games. julien laurens explains why there was only one choice for espn fc\'s top u star. club/country: manchester city/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm to the surprise of many, the england u international has seen plenty of playing time this season after making his premier league debut in august. while lewis is not an undisputed regular for manchester city, the fact that manager pep guardiola let a world-class full-back in joao cancelo join bayern munich on loan in january offers a clue as to how highly the teenager is rated at his club. strengths: a polished, well-schooled academy product, lewis is neat on the ball, dribbles well and has the composure and intelligence to respond to guardiola\'s tactical demands. his agility on the ball also means he can shift inside to feature in midfield, take part in swift one-touch combinations and find space in areas other than down the touchline. how he can improve: while his pace often comes to his rescue, lewis\' decision-making and incisiveness in defensive one-on-ones are areas to work on. adding more aggression to his game would also be a good idea. club/country: borussia dortmund/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm moukoko\'s early career has not taken off in the way that was predicted following his incredible goal tally at youth level and his record-breaking entry to the borussia dortmund first team at the age of . however, the germany international has seen increased playing time this campaign (initially because of sebastien haller\'s illness) with six goals in bundesliga games so far. strengths: predominantly recognised for his spectacular left-footed shot (his first goal against bochum was a goal of the season candidate) which made him so prolific at youth level, moukoko is a fast, penetrative forward with sharp off-the-ball movement. he comes to life when turning his marker and entering the final third, where he can bear down on goal and test the goalkeeper. how he can improve: his ball control can be slightly untidy, which can result in unnecessary touches or losing possession completely. his hold-up play remains in development, and he could be more imaginative and positive in his choice of passes. club/country: ac milan/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: despite standing at -foot-, thiaw is elegant, moves with ease and exudes a calm authority uncommon for a young centre-back. along with good timing and interception skills, he is particularly dominant in the air (having won nearly % of his challenges since the turn of the year) and stays alert for clearances and crucial tackles. when playing out from the back, he avoids risks and his long passes are of high quality. how he can improve: unsurprisingly for a -year-old defender, there have been lapses of concentration in both the passing and man-marking departments, as illustrated in the recent away defeats at fiorentina and udinese. club/country: aston villa/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm the villa academy graduate -- now playing under his third head coach -- has established himself as an integral part of the first xi. his upward trajectory means that a senior england call-up should be a viable short-term goal for the u international. strengths: adapting to a more attacking role (further wide, but with the licence to cut inside) under manager unai emery, ramsey has been given the freedom to use his incredible spatial awareness in attacking areas. full of energy and enthusiasm, the dynamic midfielder is among the best dribblers in the premier league. he times his runs into the box well, is a fine finisher and doesn\'t shirk his defensive duties to help regain possession. how he can improve: ramsey needs to learn how to dial back the pace a little to add more patience, imagination and precision to his passing game. club/country: psv eindhoven/netherlands age: estimated transfer value: EURm in his first season as a regular, the barcelona academy graduate has treated the psv fans to some displays of individual quality. having left psg in the summer -- ostensibly because of limited game time -- the french giants may regret not hanging on to the midfielder, who plays with childlike joy when he is on the pitch. strengths: because of his roaming nature, simons operates with ease in any attacking formation. he has the nous to find space between the lines, a low centre of gravity and sublime ball control that makes him hard to dispossess. in a martin odegaard-esque manner, he picks out teammates with perfectly weighted passes (. chances created per minutes), even in crowded areas. not to mention there\'s end product too; his goals -- varying from flamboyant chips and well-timed runs off the shoulders of defenders to curled efforts from the edge of the box -- have placed him at joint top of the eredivisie goal-scoring charts. how he can improve: his playfulness can lead to him losing the ball too much, while he could make even more use of his left foot. club/country: everton/belgium age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: courtesy of his excellent work rate, the - onana provides a persistent, reliable enforcing presence in midfield. his size doesn\'t restrict his mobility as he enters duels (an average of nine attacking challenges per minutes) and presses with high intensity. just as his frequent ball recoveries, aerial dominance and tackling alleviate the pressure on everton\'s defence, onana is also hard to dispossess -- especially when he sets off on a forward burst with the ball. how he can improve: first and foremost a defensive-minded midfielder who is mainly tasked with ball-winning and retention, onana can improve his first touch and be less predictable when he has time and space. club/country: celta vigo/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm veiga is the breakout story in laliga this season, helping celta vigo climb up the table. the midfielder\'s rapid rise -- he had only started one league match prior to this season -- has sparked interest from several top premier league sides and also real madrid and barcelona. strengths: predominantly a roaming no. , veiga has all the qualities to become a top performer in the role. not only is he exceptionally good at finding the right attacking spaces, but he also exhibits the confidence, precision and technique to hit the target from the edge of the box, which has seen him score nine laliga goals this season. his forceful drives forward are an essential aspect for a player in his role, while he breaks through the opposing lines with his passes and provides passing options for his own teammates. veiga\'s willingness to work hard defensively and smart off-the-ball positioning to regain possession add another dimension to his game. how he can improve: with even more sharpness and accuracy from his passing in the final third, veiga could become a frequent assist provider. club/country: manchester united/argentina age: estimated transfer value: EURm garnacho has been one of the beneficiaries of new man united manager erik ten hag\'s youth-focused leadership and, although he tends to be used as an impact substitute, there\'s little doubt that the argentina international is held in high esteem by his head coach. as well as scoring two premier league goals, he has also made an impact in the europa league and domestic cup competitions. strengths: usually deployed as a left winger, garnacho can turn the dynamics of a game through mesmerising, intuitive dribbles. his outstanding balance, coordination, burst of acceleration and ability to take on defenders on either side make him hard to read. he draws defenders to him, helping create space for his teammates, while his confidence in the first-team environment has grown. how he can improve: often too selfish in possession, his decision-making needs work. his off-the-ball movement is becoming less predictable, but some added upper-body strength would make him even more effective. club/country: bayern munich/netherlands age: estimated transfer value: EURm once considered one of the best young talents in european football, the midfielder has had a frustrating time since moving to bayern munich from ajax for EURm last summer. playing time has been scarce -- he has only started one bundesliga match -- and when coming on from the bench, he has generally been unable to make the desired impact. gravenberch hasn\'t hidden his discontent, which in turn has triggered speculation about his long-term future at the club. strengths: at his best, the netherlands international -- who was recently demoted to the u side -- is a technically superb, agile and intelligent central midfielder. equally able to play as a holding midfielder or as a no. , gravenberch can dictate the flow of the game by dropping deep to pick up the ball and distribute it with well-angled passes. at -foot-, he pairs excellent coordination with the ability to seamlessly glide past opponents without losing the ball. though more prevalent from his ajax days, gravenberch\'s shooting skills are also of a high standard. how he can improve: the key for gravenberch to reverse his fortunes at bayern is likely to come down to his mental toughness and ability to overcome adversity. in the short term, it\'s a matter of asserting himself when given the chance or, if that fails, kick-start his career under the guidance of a coaching team prepared to make him an integral part of their midfield. club/country: southampton/belgium age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: typically lined up as one of two deep midfielders, lavia is charged with the less glamorous tasks of the role. powerful, mobile and disciplined, he closes down space, regains possession, offers receiving options, covers sizable areas and hassles opponents. moreover, the teenager conducts himself with an aura of authority that belies his age. equipped with a fine close control and balance to shield the ball, lavia rarely gives away possession. how he can improve: the former anderlecht prospect could add another dimension to his game by taking more risks in his passing -- though easier said than done in a struggling side. club/country: chelsea/brazil age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: with great energy, strength and high levels of technical ability, the -year-old can successfully be deployed as a no. defensive midfielder or as a roaming box-to-box midfielder. in fact, his vigorous style makes him more suited to the latter as he is brilliant at driving forward with the ball and timing his runs into the box. most of his goals originate from picking up rebounds and reading where the ball will drop in the final third. how he can improve: the premier league\'s intensity means he will have less time on the ball. he will need to adapt to its physicality, too. club/country: bayer leverkusen/ecuador age: estimated transfer value: EURm following a positive debut season in european football, the -year-old has further cemented his status as the preferred left-sided centre-back (or left wing-back) in leverkusen\'s back three. however, consistency remains an issue, with his showing for ecuador at the world cup offering a fair snapshot of his tendencies: composed and alert against netherlands, he struggled against senegal and gave away a penalty with a rash challenge. strengths: proactive, confident, quick and technically proficient, hincapie is well suited to a team wanting to dominate possession and defend high up the pitch. slotting in on the left of a back three, he enjoys the freedom to push forward to create numerical advantage in midfield and possesses the touch, vision and passing skills to add an attacking x-factor. his steady progression has included more interceptions and more tackles won, and he is now being trusted more on the ball. how he can improve: his aggressive style of defending does result in excessive fouling -- he has two red cards this campaign -- just as his high-risk style of defending high up the pitch occasionally puts his teammates in trouble. club/country: atalanta/denmark age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: at first glance it\'s tempting to expect the -foot- striker to operate like an out-and-out centre-forward. however, he thrives when setting off on deep, incisive runs against high defensive lines and can also be fielded from a position out wide on the right. combining his impressive physique and lightning pace (according to his head coach, gian piero gasperini, he completes a -meter sprint in less than seconds) with smart, varied movement and a powerful left-footed shot, hojlund is stylistically similar to young man city striker erling haaland. how he can improve: with added composure in front of goal, a more focused hold-up game (he has around nine ball losses per minutes) and better timing with his headers (he wins just % of his aerial duels), hojlund could develop into a top-level forward. club/country: athletic club/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm williams has elevated himself from impact substitute to key player in the athletic side. to underline his sharp development, the winger has earned a spot with the senior spain team and made four appearances at the world cup. strengths: williams has impressive upper-body strength, good balance and an electric turn of pace. combined with instinctive control and an ability to time his runs well, he is an unpredictable winger who can be hard to defend against. his capacity to turn, dribble, shoot and finish with either foot (he\'s naturally right-footed) makes him adept at tormenting full-backs on either side of the pitch, often cutting infield to create havoc. how he can improve: williams has to up his efficiency in defensive challenges (only a % success rate), while the quality of his crossing also leaves something to be desired. club/country: chelsea/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: physically imposing and comfortable on the ball, badiashile looks every inch the modern centre-back. though he can walk a tightrope with the excessive confidence he displays when bringing the ball out of the defence, the france international has toned down his risk-taking for a more safety-first approach. badiashile reads the game exceptionally well, deals assertively with challenges and transmits confidence across the back line. how he can improve: badiashile needs to show more of what we saw from his monaco days: evading opposing pressure and playing the first, incisive pass out of defence. club/country: benfica/portugal age: estimated transfer value: EURm ramos took cristiano ronaldo\'s starting spot for portugal against switzerland at the world cup, scored a hat trick and has gone from strength to strength since. his goal scoring in the portuguese league, with over this season, has firmly placed him among the best young centre-forwards in the game and he will surely become benfica\'s next high-profile export. strengths: ramos has sharpened his game in all departments after being trusted with the centre-forward role this season (he was previously also used as a left winger.) while his pace has never been in question, ramos has also demonstrated fine spatial awareness inside the box with the majority of his goals (his expected goals per hovers around .) coming mainly from one-touch finishes from close range. his mental toughness, aerial potency and general involvement in the build-up phase have also seen improvement. ramos has demonstrated he can raise his game for big occasions such as the world cup or a derby against sporting cp, in which he scored a brace in january. how he can improve: in addition to being occasionally sloppy with flicks and lay-offs in the final third, ramos could -- as much as it may sound unfair given his impressive numbers -- up his scoring efficiency even more (he takes nearly three shots per minutes now.) club/country: paris saint-germain/portugal age: estimated transfer value: EURm in his second season at psg, mendes has confirmed his status as one of the top young full-backs in world football. though injuries have proved disruptive both for himself (his world cup with portugal was cut short for that reason) and psg coach christophe galtier, he is still one of the most consistent members of the squad. strengths: whether fielded as a left-back in a back four or as a wing-back in a -- formation, mendes is a force to be reckoned with down the left side. providing an outlet for switches of play, he is exceptionally skilled at taking on opponents through rapid turns of direction and his -plus touches inside the opposing penalty area per minutes speak volumes of his desire to join the attack. he has built a fine understanding with kylian mbappe and is also a tenacious defender who comes out on top in % of his defensive duels. how he can improve: though mendes is a fine crosser of the ball, his efficiency (%) could improve. however, this isn\'t necessarily all down to him -- it\'s also the job of his teammates to get on the end of the crosses. club/country: ajax amsterdam/netherlands age: estimated transfer value: EURm having been linked with a big transfer for the past year or so, one may have expected timber to have departed ajax by now, especially since half the side that fared so well in the champions league last season have secured lucrative moves themselves. the highly rated central defender, who can also play at right-back, is still on the watchlist of the elite clubs in europe amid another fine season. strengths: timber has most of the attributes required for a modern centre-back. safe in possession -- a passing accuracy of % (per minutes) is impressive for a defender who likes to build from the back -- his close control allows him to draw opposing pressure from which he can escape with a neat touch or dash of acceleration if options to pass are lacking. his lightning pace makes him well suited to playing a high line in defence, while his anticipation enables him to get his body in front of opponents and time his tackles well. how he can improve: being relatively short for a defender at - impacts his aerial efficiency (% of duels won), so he may be best suited to a club that plays a back three (as he lines up for netherlands.) club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm one of the most naturally gifted talents of his generation, ansu is striving to return to the spectacular form that saw him burst onto the scene with barcelona at the age of . whether still compromised by the knee injury that kept him out for nearly a year, burdened by the expectations that come with his reputation, affected by a lack of minutes or simply going through the natural ups and downs of a young player, he is still yet to reach his full potential. how he can improve: staying injury-free and finding more consistency at the highest level is key. but a loan move to an environment away from the demanding camp nou could see ansu obtain the required playing time to kick-start his career. club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm it has been an incredible journey for balde: from barcelona\'s la masia academy and the b team to becoming the first-choice senior left-back and a full spain international in less than a year. the emergence of such a wonderful prospect who has adapted so quickly to the highest level is a dream come true for financially stricken barcelona. strengths: balde possesses most of the qualities you want from a young full-back. he times his runs well, his positioning when playing out from the back is improving and when entering the final third, his one-on-one skills and quick interchanges with teammates are excellent. while he often relies on his pace to deal with defensive situations, his reading of the game is getting better and, as an attacking force, he is a danger in wide areas as well as when he cuts inside. how he can improve: he needs a higher degree of focus to track opponents\' runs off his shoulder and could be more attentive in his marking inside the box. his crossing could also be more varied. espn fc analysts give their take on the top best players under in world football. club/country: brighton & hove albion/ecuador age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: covering large areas of the pitch with ease, caicedo is alert to the dynamics of the game and can make a big impact when he steps up. in addition to his remarkable consistency, endurance and presence on the pitch, he tackles with precision, presses diligently and continuously scans for interceptions and loose balls. though a natural in his defensive duties, he is capable of carrying the ball forward, linking well with the left full-back and finding space to take advantage of rebounds to fire off shots from the edge of the box. how he can improve: caicedo almost unfailingly plays to his maximum capacity every game, yet he has the quality and vision to take more risks with his passing in the final third. club/country: rb leipzig/croatia age: estimated transfer value: EURm the croatia defender hardly put a foot wrong at the world cup -- at least until he encountered argentina\'s lionel messi in full flow -- and he has made a big impact in the champions league for his club, getting on the scoresheet and standing out against real madrid and manchester city (in the first leg). while he is contracted at leipzig for another four years, gvardiol is attracting interest from the biggest clubs in europe. strengths: gvardiol is blessed with excellent pace, balance and physical robustness that makes him efficient in defensive one-on-ones. he has a great left foot, with fine close control, and is comfortable spraying medium- and long-range passes out of defence with accuracy. at , he operates with the confidence of a defender years his senior. how he can improve: he needs to pay more attention when tracking opponents on crosses and in high-intensity defensive situations. his sporadic lack of focus was highlighted in the - champions league defeat at manchester city, though that was down to a collective collapse rather than any one individual. club/country: bayer leverkusen/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm following a nine-month injury absence because of a ruptured cruciate ligament, wirtz has managed to get himself back to the level he was at before disaster struck. alongside no. on this list, wirtz is arguably the most talented german prospect of his generation and has made a huge impact for leverkusen, both domestically and in europe. strengths: one of the most complete attacking midfielders in european football, wirtz -- who is equally dominant in a central position behind the striker, cutting in from the left or even as a false nine up front -- is excellent at gaining space with his wonderful dribbling abilities. not only is he capable of beating opponents from a standing position, he also does something clinical afterwards, with cleverly executed passes, well-engineered combinations or shots on target. in addition to being a technically gifted playmaker, wirtz\'s avid pressing helps him win the ball back. how he can improve: staying clear of injury will be key in his development but he needs to target double figures in goals and assists next season. making a consistent impact on games throughout the minutes will ensure he steps up to the next level. club/country: arsenal/brazil age: estimated transfer value: EURm not only has the brazilian forward been a major contributor in arsenal\'s spectacular premier league season, but he has also been one of the most improved players in european football. aided by more fluency in the team\'s attack and compatible players around him, martinelli\'s confidence has skyrocketed and he has polished the rougher sides of his game. strengths: with his explosive pace, excellent balance and unpredictable off-the-ball movement, martinelli poses a constant threat to opposition defences. over the course of the year, he has sharpened his skills, adding another level of precision which has seen him make . key passes per minutes. on the evidence of his premier league goals from position on the left wing -- often by way of late, well-timed runs and one-touch finishes with either foot -- he possesses superb timing and appreciation of space. his ever-present intensity helps in the press, and his work rate and eagerness to learn is high. how he can improve: martinelli could stand to improve the accuracy of his short passes, combination touches and lay-offs, and he can also be liable to lose momentum or run out of ideas when facing a wall of defenders. club/country: real madrid/france age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: calm in possession and comfortable on the ball, camavinga performs his deeper role in midfield expertly. he drops back to collect the ball from his centre-backs and actively roams in space to provide a passing outlet for his full-backs. when distributing from defence with his left foot, he demonstrates impressive accuracy in all facets of his passing, while he\'s often the initiator of moves that end in goal-scoring opportunities. versatile enough to operate as a no. , too, he can break opposition lines with a rapid burst of pace, presses with intent and reads the game well in order to pick up loose balls. how he can improve: given his skill set, there\'s no reason why camavinga shouldn\'t develop into one of the top midfield playmakers around. more variety in his range of passing could help; however, he is on record saying: ""i would only change my right foot: it\'s very bad."" club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm strengths: to find such a high level of technical, physical and mental attributes wrapped up in an -year-old midfielder is nothing short of awe-inspiring. his classy touch, combined with fabulous spatial awareness, cognitive sharpness and remarkable command of his body (when he sends opponents the wrong way when receiving the ball on the half-turn), are most commonly associated with flair players like neymar or ronaldinho. yet gavi backs that up with an unyielding desire to get on the ball and an unwavering determination to win it back. his competitive nature really stands out and, regardless of where he lines up tactically, his input is unquestionable and his energy contagious. weaknesses: while he is super competitive -- he was involved in more fouls for and against () than any other player at the world cup -- his decision-making around tackles still needs work. club/country: bayern munich/germany age: estimated transfer value: EURm despite a slightly below-par season by bayern munich\'s high standards, musiala has delivered a level of performance that exceeds any reasonable expectations for the squad\'s youngest first-team player. thanks to his versatility, he has been utilised in a variety of positions and while former coach julian nagelsmann preferred him as an attacking midfielder on the left side, it remains to be seen what new boss thomas tuchel will do. strengths: a technical star on the ball, musiala applies himself with maturity and is quick at reverting to pressing mode when his team lose possession. there are few unnecessary touches or flashy moments; instead, he aids the team\'s attacking flow with constructive, progressive involvements, illustrated by his admirable judgement of when and where to make use of his wonderful dribbling skills (% successful dribbles per minutes.) on top of his brilliant control, playmaking capabilities and linking of midfield and attack through his passing, he brings the end product too. with goals this season, making him bayern\'s leading scorer in the bundesliga, musiala exudes calmness in his finishing and, even at speed, ensures he scans the play before deciding on the best course of action. how he can improve: with a versatile skill set in both attack and defence, perfectly made for the modern game, musiala has few shortcomings. however, he has a slight tendency for his influence to drop towards the latter stages, so completing more games to the full minutes will be beneficial in his development. club/country: arsenal/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm the main creative catalyst behind arsenal\'s unexpected challenge for the premier league title this season, saka, a converted left-back, has blossomed into one of the best right wingers in the game. he has hit double figures for goals and assists, while also proving an inspirational presence for england at the world cup. with his ability to make an impact at the highest level, the down-to-earth saka has taken every challenge in stride. strengths: saka thrives when he finds space wide on the right as his fine command of either foot gives him the option to either proceed at high speed for a quick one-two combination or advance on the outside of the marker to put in a cross or shot. adept at picking up the ball on the move and carrying it with pace, he has increased the intensity of arsenal\'s attacks and disrupts opponents\' defensive organisation. how he can improve: there are moments when he goes missing and fails to impose himself on a game which, in fairness, is not unusual for such a young player. saka can improve his defensive contributions, yet he is already winning more challenges in every area of the pitch and is showing more alertness to his pressing duties. club/country: barcelona/spain age: estimated transfer value: EURm indispensable for club and country, the gifted midfielder has built on his sky-high reputation with an outstanding - campaign. he excelled for spain during the world cup and confirmed his status as one of the top midfielders in the world regardless of age or role. pedri\'s influence on barcelona has also grown under xavi\'s leadership. much like last season, however, injuries have been a disrupting factor. strengths: though he already has the profile of a complete central attacking midfielder, the former las palmas star\'s skill set goes off the charts when it comes to technical ability, receiving and distributing the ball. in addition to his passing range -- instinctive, penetrative, needing few touches and on the half-turn -- is an extraordinary awareness to pick the right space with consistency. arguably best in an offensive no. role, pedri glues the attack together with his rhythmic interchanges. he demands the ball in the most advantageous areas before moving it on with precision to a teammate. off the ball, his exceptional spatial awareness and timing of runs sees him get on the end of attacks with one-touch finishes or quick combinations to create a chance. what makes pedri even more special is that he\'s a team player: he presses with diligence and recovers the ball three times per game on average. how he can improve: performing consistently at the upper limits of what can be expected of a -year-old, he does have one area of improvement -- becoming more robust in physical duels. club/country: borussia dortmund/england age: estimated transfer value: EURm the england international features an exceptional array of physical, technical and mental attributes, and as the perfect box-to-box midfielder -- with the versatility to feature deeper or higher up the pitch as a starting position -- he is a generational talent. strengths: where do you start? equipped with athleticism, stamina and close control, bellingham is outstanding on the ball (nearly three progressive carries and six dribbles per minutes.) once a defensive line has been broken, he\'s an accurate passer too and is able to create chances with precise touches and impressive vision. from deeper positions, he spreads the play routinely and picks out the attacking runs of his teammates early. as seen at the world cup with england, bellingham is strong in the air and, when arriving in the box, displays composure in front of goal. for all the technical and tactical mastery, it can be overlooked that he is both meticulous and proficient in his defensive game too. from an impressive challenges per minutes in the bundesliga, he comes out on top at a rate of %. how he can improve: though it speaks volumes about his confidence and willingness to take responsibility, his inclination to take lots of shots on goal does lead to his accuracy being slightly on the low side (%).'}",piero hincapie,en,2023-03-29T11:35:08Z

""you never know what's going to happen. you see what [australia's] just done at the last one and for the next few years, building up to [] i think we can do some really big things in the future. i mean, why not say it?"" now bombastic declarations, commitments to future success, and an almost fanatically unwavering sense of self-belief aren't exactly a new phenomenon for this australian team. graham arnold is back for another four-year cycle, and once again declaring his belief that these coming years will give rise to the greatest socceroos team of all time. but to hear such a statement from a -year-old with less than international minutes under his belt, for a nation that's progression to the last at the world cup was considered a bit of a miracle, is still striking. in most circumstances, you'd call it brash. but if you're training week-in and week-out under pep guardiola as robertson is at manchester city, to say nothing of rubbing shoulders with players such as kevin de bryne, bernardo silva, and ilkay gundogan, then a few things are going to rub off on you. things such as an all-encompassing focus on winning and a special kind of belief in one's abilities to take whatever adverse circumstances are placed in front of you and replace it with a more acceptable reality. the kind of mental acuity that only the elite of the elite possesses. according to the marketing, friday evening's game was all about ""welcoming home"" and celebrating the achievements of the squad that belied all sense of rhyme and reason in qatar. an easy, feelgood moment for the side and football australia to soak it all in before competitive fixtures, and potential reality bricks to the face, return. but the present's great curse is that it will never quite match up to the plentiful future of the imagination. and with injured statesmen such as aaron mooy and mat leckie absent, the fixture quickly became about the mystery box that is the next-gen. robertson was one of two players to make their senior international debuts in sydney's west, melbourne city midfielder aiden o'neill starting alongside fellow -year-old keanu baccus in the heart of the socceroos' midfield. handed the task of containing moises caicedo, the duo unspectacularly but effectively marshalled the threat of the brighton man. and though one middling game won't make his suitors rethink their position, it was caicedo and not any error on their part - a poor back pass to piero hincapie - that provided the game's turning point in allowing australia to take a - lead. behind o'neill and baccus, harry souttar and kye rowles reprised their roles from qatar in the heart of the australian defence, a role it appears they will be given every chance to maintain over the next three-and-a-half years. further ahead, -year-old garang kuol did his thing as a late substitute and netted australia's third from close range, inevitably providing him with a mental boost to continue to persevere after a challenging, but not unexpected, start to life in european club football. friday evening, as well as tuesday's return fixture in melbourne, never really had much hope of retaining a focus on reflection over projection. the coming game in victoria will likely see senior international debuts for joe gauci (), jordy bos () and nestory irankunda (), as well as potentially greater roles for connor metcalfe (), marco tilio (), nathaniel atkinson (), riley mcgree (), and cameron devlin (). alou kuol (), denis genreau (), tyrese francois (), daniel arzani (), and gianni stensness () will be watching at home. if it feels like there's a lot of talent coming through, that's because there is, and with more on the way behind them. certainly enough to banish the lazy (and incorrect) claim that australia doesn't have ""the cattle"" to compete in asia for a while. yes, there are never any guarantees in football, but a new generation is seemingly on the way, one that can give australian football fans reason to be optimistic. even if you'd struggle to find many quite as sanguine as robertson.'}",piero hincapié,en,2023-03-24T15:24:08Z

""my concern isn\'t marking my place in the roma history books,"" mourinho told sky sports. ""it\'s helping these kids [players] to grow and achieve important things. ""it\'s also helping the roma fans who have given me so much since day one. it\'s an immense joy to get to another final."" with a deficit to overturn, leverkusen were on the front foot early on and diaby came close to levelling the tie after being sent clear down the right, only for his fierce effort to rattle the bar and bounce clear. kerem demirbay saw his low shot saved by roma goalkeeper rui patricio soon after, while leverkusen were furious when the referee waved play on when sardar azmoun appeared to be pulled down by bryan cristante just outside the box with just patricio to beat. the home side continued to push forward in the second half with azmoun dragging a shot just wide, but for all their territorial dominance they struggled to create clear-cut chances. instead roma can look forward to a second european final in as many years having not reached one for years prior to last season. formation --- formation -- match ends, bayer leverkusen , roma . second half ends, bayer leverkusen , roma . attempt blocked. nadiem amiri (bayer leverkusen) right footed shot from outside the box is blocked. assisted by kerem demirbay. tammy abraham (roma) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul. nadiem amiri (bayer leverkusen) wins a free kick on the left wing. foul by tammy abraham (roma). foul by piero hincapie (bayer leverkusen). tammy abraham (roma) wins a free kick in the defensive half. edmond tapsoba (bayer leverkusen) is shown the yellow card. attempt blocked. nadiem amiri (bayer leverkusen) right footed shot from the right side of the box is blocked. assisted by jeremie frimpong. attempt blocked. moussa diaby (bayer leverkusen) left footed shot from outside the box is blocked. assisted by jeremie frimpong. foul by moussa diaby (bayer leverkusen). nicola zalewski (roma) wins a free kick in the defensive half. moussa diaby (bayer leverkusen) is shown the yellow card. foul by moussa diaby (bayer leverkusen). bryan cristante (roma) wins a free kick in the defensive half. bryan cristante (roma) is shown the yellow card. edmond tapsoba (bayer leverkusen) wins a free kick in the defensive half. foul by tammy abraham (roma). foul by piero hincapie (bayer leverkusen).'}",piero hincapié,en,2023-05-18T21:09:58Z
