    "## Intro\n",
    "The goal of this file is to get all articles from newsapi.org that include the given playername. Per article we store the information for which player it was retrieved and the information from the API of when the article was published and in which language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The free version of the API limits us in three ways: \n",
    "* we are only allowed to make 100 requests per day,\n",
    "* per request we will only get maximum 100 articles and\n",
    "* we will only be able to retrieve the data 1 month back.\n",
    "\n",
    "We nevertheless decided for this API, as the other APIs that we looked at even had more restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we created an initial csv with the following steps: \n",
    "1. Get data for one player for one language:                get_articlesplayer\n",
    "2. Get data for multiple players and multiple languages:    get_players_df        using get_articlesplayer\n",
    "And then we updated this csv, at least every month, with the following steps:\n",
    "3. Get the Date where a file was last updated:              get_date_of_file\n",
    "4. Update a given file:                                     updateplayerdata      using get_players_df\n",
    "Duplicates will be filtered out in the Preprocessing ."
