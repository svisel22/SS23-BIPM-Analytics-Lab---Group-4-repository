(jpw) bukayo saka had hardly been linked with a move away from arsenal, but with just one year left on his existing deal, the -year-old winger has put pen to paper on a new contract for three more years and (presumably) a lot more money. with one game left this season, saka leads arsenal in goals () and assists (). unfortunately for the rest of the premier league, saka's very best is still probably to come. (ae) as for gundogan, he is another player who has just one year left on his contract at manchester city and the city skipper has long been linked with a move to barcelona. on paper it seems like gundogan, , could be a really good addition to this arsenal side. he would help the youngsters continue to develop, while he has worked closely with mikel arteta before when the current arsenal boss was assistant coach at man city. we've all seen how well gabriel jesus and oleksandr zinchenko have settled in at arsenal after arriving from man city and gundogan would provide the quality, experience and winning knowhow arsenal need to make the next step. (jpw) mikel arteta is targeting -year-old rb leipzig center back mohamed simakan, though he'll face competition from within the premier league according to\xafichajes. simakan has produced three goals and eight assists across all competitions this season, also spending time at right back and even a bit more advanced over the course of the campaign. a very good passer and monster in the air, the french young international left strasbourg for leipzig in and has been a force this season despite missing a handful of games for various ailments. (nm) with just one year remaining on his current contract, declan rice is all but certain to leave west ham this summer, as arsenal and newcastle are both ) preparing to be in next season's uefa champions league, and ) very interested in the -year-old services. montpellier striker elye wahi's goals and three assists this season have arsenal and tottenham (as well as psg) looking to woo the striker to north london this summer, according to french site\xajeunes footeux. wahi turned in january and he has a contract through the - season so he won't come cheap. the report says montpellier's asking for around $ million. the center forward's more than -feet tall and had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering sunday's league match with toulouse. the advanced stats say wahi's a raw scorer; he carries the ball above average but has been effective almost strictly as a finisher. mikel arteta already has a young english-american center forward coming back from loan in france and a few options already in north london but... maybe? (nm) real madrid splashed a lot of cash on monaco star aurelien tchouameni, but his status as an expensive player who isn't starting opens him up for a sale, according to catalan site el nacional. long-linked with arsenal and liverpool before moving to real, tchouameni is also being mentioned as a target for paris saint-germain, chelsea, and manchester united. the -year-old has played very well when called upon, as advertised an excellent ball mover who relishes his space when the opponent has the ball. carlo ancelotti has found minutes for tchouameni but the loaded midfield situation means real boss florentino perez is looking at an $ million player who is often on the bench to start games. could he look to recoup fees to splash on a striker? (nm) mikel arteta wants some new blood at right back and his club is looking to turkey for a french youngster. sacha boey, , has been capped by france at several youth levels but has launched his profile sky high this season with galatasaray. boey has two goals in appearances this year, having moved from rennes in . he previously racked up -plus ligue appearances between rennes and dijon. a report from turkish site aksam has arsenal leading the race of lyon, sporting lisbon, and premier league clubs crystal palace and aston villa. (nm) mikel arteta sees some things he likes in italy, where world cup winner lautaro martinez and serbia star sergej milinkovic-savic are reported as targets for the arsenal. martinez, , had been starring for inter milan long before he helped lionel messi win a world cup, and the argentine has goals and seven assists across all competitions this season. teamtalk says that chelsea and manchester united are also looking at the super star striker, who could pair up very nicely with gabriel jesus and bukayo saka. calcio mercato has the report on milinkovic-savic to arsenal. could the lazio star finally make his move to the premier league after being linked with an england transfer for ages? the -year-old has caps and seven goals for serbia, and he's twice been serie a best xi, including last season. milinkovic-savic is lazio's two-time defending player of the year. milinkovic-savic is among the complete midfielders in the game. newcastle and west ham have also been heavily linked with his services, but only one is currently on pace to offer him european football. advantage: arsenal? (nm) can never have enough finishers, can you? arsenal is said to be joining real madrid, manchester united, and newcastle in pursuit of -year-old atalanta striker rasmus hojlund. twice-capped by denmark, hojlund started at home with copenhagen before heading to austria's sturm graz. hojlund has goals and five assists in appearances across all competitions between sturm graz and atalanta, scoring against dynamo kiev in champions league qualification for the latter. he's one to watch, but it's also worth noting that atalanta just purchased him in summer and is very much in the race for champions league places in serie a. he could do worse than collecting some group stage seasoning in the ucl and uel at a club that spotted him early. heck, would a club like arsenal consider a summer buy and loan back to italy? (nm) reports out of north london say that arsenal is nearing new deals with -year-olds: center back william saliba and, perhaps more eye-catching, playmaker bukayo saka. london-born and with england caps, saka is one of the faces of arsenal's renaissance. a relentless worker off the ball, he has nine goals and eight assists in premier league play this season and would fetch a heaping helping of salary on the open market. easy decision for the gunners, given his status within the team.

(nm) a report from the daily mail says arsenal have submitted a second bid for moises caicedo, with an improved offer of $. million going in. brighton are said to want $ million for caicedo. he did not play against liverpool in the fa cup on sunday and reportedly he will not be around the team until feb. , after the transfer deadline. brighton have told caicedo they want him to stay but his social media posting asking to be allowed to leave has put the writing on the wall. will arsenal up their offer and get their main ahead of chelsea?

(jpw) excl: moises caicedo didn't turn up for training today -- he wants leave immediately. caicedo could also miss tomorrow's game.  #bhafc :police_car_light: understand arsenal are expected to improve their bid, after PSm revealed yesterday. #afc -- fabrizio romano (@fabrizioromano) january , reports say that arsenal will led cedric soares head on loan to london neighbors fulham, but not without a replacement. sky sports says that arsenal and borussia dortmund are in hot pursuit of real valladolid right back ivan fresneda. marca\xasays that fresneda missed valladolid training amid reports that arsenal matched bvb's $ million bid for the back. the -year-old has started regularly for valladolid this season when healthy and has represented spain at the u- and u- levels. valladolid doesn't have a lot of the ball so there are limited ways to judge his attacking production even by advanced metrics, but he does rank well in receiving the ball and has terrific numbers in tackles, interceptions, and clearances according to fbref.com. (nm) after usmnt midfielder weston mckennie was linked with a move to arsenal, it appears that leeds united are also keen on the american. according to fabrizio romano, mckennie is an option leeds are looking at. with tyler adams and brenden aaronson already at elland road, thanks largely to american coach jesse marsch, perhaps mckennie will head to leeds where he will likely play every week? that probably won't be the case at arsenal, at least initially.

(jpw) -- arsenal (@arsenal) january , -- fabrizio romano (@fabrizioromano) january , arsenal are being linked with wingers galore at the moment and it appears bayer leverkusen's moussa diaby is the latest target. according to our partners in the uk at sky sports, arsenal have reached out to leverkusen about the availability of diaby. the -year-old winger is a french international and leverkusen have reportedly said he is worth over $ million. does that fee sound familiar? it is the transfer fee chelsea just paid shakhtar donetsk for mudryk and is now seen as the reference point for a talented winger in europe. diaby's speed, crossing ability and penchant to cut inside mean he is very similar to arsenal's current wide players and he would slot into this system perfectly. he also creates and scores a lot of goals ( assists and goals since the start of the - season), which is always handy. it seems like a move in the summer is more likely but arsenal are putting the building blocks in place.

""he has just spoken to the head of state by telephone. the latter asked him to wait for the arrival of a delegation to meet with the leaders at his home."" toure received the same call late at night, he said, but felt it was impossible to postpone the rally. diallo spoke up, according to keita, saying: ""we have to leave, because the population has already turned out, we have no way to delay the rally."" all the opposition leaders - with the exception of dore - then set off to join ""the bulk of the troops at the stadium"". ""there was so much noise, you couldn\'t hear the gunfire"" a ""human tide"" awaited them there, according to ben youssouf keita, an estimated several thousand people. while the politicians had planned to make their speech on the esplanade in front of the stadium, they were dragged inside by a frenzied crowd. ""it was euphoria, celebration,"" he recalled. keita climbed into the stands with the other leaders. there was an atmosphere of joyful chaos. ""there was so much noise, you couldn\'t hear the gunfire,"" he told the court. suddenly, he saw people starting to fall under fire. the danger was getting closer, and everyone was fleeing. it was ""every man for himself"". keita stayed next to his leader. a hooded soldier advanced towards them. he called out to diallo and ordered him to come down from the stands. the ufdg leader did not comply. the soldier charged at him, made him fall to the ground and hit him brutally. keita escaped and miraculously managed to get out of the stadium. but in front of the entrance, just as he thought he was out of trouble, he came across a soldier armed with a piece of wood who tried to smash his skull. keita protected himself and escaped with a broken hand and a wound on his back. diallo suffered four broken ribs. several opposition leaders were injured that day, but none fatally. opposition responsibility? ben youssouf keita was admitted to the emergency room of donka hospital, he said, around -. in the afternoon. while waiting to be taken care of, he saw ""young people, women, lying around moaning"". the minister of health, colonel abdoulaye cherif diaby who is now in the dock, ""passed within a metre"" of him, according to the witness, reprimanding the wounded. he was ""furious"", according to keita. ""i am here today to understand,"" he told the court. ""i have absolutely no hatred against anyone, i do not cry vengeance and i do not want any compensation, neither material nor financial, but i want to understand. when you understand something you can tolerate it, bear it. why didn\'t this minister of health, who took the hippocratic oath, act like a doctor? he didn\'t have the pity he should have when faced with those who suffer."" get the latest in african news delivered straight to your inbox by submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy. almost finished... there was a problem processing your submission. please try again later. at the trial, the surgeon\'s testimony unleashed passions. the defence lawyers, more divided than ever, clashed. one of them questioned keita: ""doctor, you have maintained here that if you had complied with the request to postpone the demonstration on september , what happened at the stadium would not have happened. do you stand by this statement? keita nodded. lancine sylla, counsel for moussa dadis camara\'s former aide-de-camp aboubacar diakite (""toumba"") retorted: ""do you agree with me that in this trial you, the political leaders, are victims and not defendants?""

"arsenal have not underwhelmed, they have overachieved this season by patrick s at the start of the season, arsenal were dismissed as top four contenders. most football experts in all media outlets in england were utterly dismissive of arsenal's top prospects. in august for example, out of the bbc sport football pundits, only thought arsenal would finish in the top and none of those thought arsenal would finish higher than th! watch arteta after etihad defeat - ""man city deserved to win"" ""they are an exceptional team....."" calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... yes. we have achieved our target which is top . but wasn't it the same target for last season? it's taken is seasons to achieve the target for season. i would rather say we were ""high flying"" this season rather than ""over achieving"". and guess what. ""high flying"" will hardly fill the pages of history. capitulating last season's ending as well as this season's ending due to the same issues shows there are still serious problems not resolved last season target was to qualify for any european cup, not champions league precisely no it was not. arteta himself said he wanted arsenal back in the c l inside years, which was last season. he did, but the task was bigger than most people thought. overachiever funny, a leicester team from no where won the league, it's about finishing the story, that leicester team would have come second and be remembered as a wonderful season for the size of the club but they saw the opportunity and grabbed it, this opportunity will not come around every season, many clubs were having a terrible season we were fantastic and created a healthy enough lead that should be able to see us through the line but failed, in few years time this could be remembered as a squandered opportunity. our best performance against city has come from the fa cup and on that night we had trossart,vieira,tierney,nkettiah rob holding all starting while city had their full squad but we played so well that city managed a one nil victory, what i saw that night was a team set up to man mark city players all over the pitch and they struggled to the extend gadiola had to change tactics in the game, the point was the team had what they needed to cross the line but was let down by the manager tactically and squad management skills, last year we experienced same lost in a row went to stanford bridge with a back and got the win at this point of the season, it's not about principles, it's not about dominant football, it's about points this is called the business end of the season when everyone is fighting, city didn't do much against fulham yesterday other than grab the points, it's not about trying a flirk, skills or showing that you are the best team, it's about going out there and bringing the points by any means thats what it's all about at this time of the season if that has been in our managers mind we would not have lost all these points we recently dropped from a position of strength it was arsenals to lose. but naivety crept in. we play same style as city, only thing is they are better at it. so when meeting them, change tactics to defensive and counter attacks, but the manager thought we could match them boy to man. leading two against west ham and continue to play as if the game is still nil/nil. i would say the manager could have done better with game management. he failed the test his only win against city was in an fa cup we just played on the counter and won, that's what i admire about madrid they play in any way that gives them the w at the end of the day history only remembers the winners.. there is nothing wrong in knowing ur teams weakness and playing to their strength, if the players available have shown they can't play the way you want then play to their strength, till everyone is back every team is looking to exploit opposition weaknesses you are right. history only remembers the winner. history could have remembered us as / pl champions and not we top the table for most weeks. are we into the cl to be eliminated and fall back to europa league? i would still prefer the pl trophy. you are right gun down. poor game management. it's all about points not style. if you are leading up. change tactics immediately and use defensive plus counter attacks. you are absolutely right. arsenal made a formidable start to the season. we took the lead in the table. when the league resumed after the wc break, everybody was concernbed about how we would cope, when starting up again, and we would be without jesus. again we stood up to the pressure, and just kept going. it is because the progress is built on a solid foundation laid over the past couple of years, and there is every chance, we can do well again in the coming years. yes, more can be expected next season from the likes of liverpool and chelsea. but, every season is always the same. some ""big"" teams will underperform, also next year. we are, where we are in our own right and not because others have faltered. arsenal behind the league champion since .: / # chelsea, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. / # liverpool, arsenal #, points behind. / # man.city, arsenal #, points behind there's no doubt that we have almost closed the gap, and i believe our progression will continue next season :red_circle: sorry, i forgot the / season. # man.city, arsenal #, points behind. there is no divine right that we wouldn't fall + points behind the winner next time or win it, ask liverpool, it's hard to predict the future the one the that we should be worried about is how we trow the top away last season and proberbly learned nothing this season by proberbly trowing away the title again in similar fashion... well, i don't believe we will be + points behind next season. we have a young team with potential to get better, and i'm sure we will recruit more quality players next summer. liverpool have and old team and haven't been clever enough with their recruitments lately. we are not throwing away anything but have to realise that other clubs are stronger. man.city has still a much better squad than us, but we are getting closer. personally i don't like deficit mentality, man city been better than us is not the reason we are failing, tell me the difference between the way we are failing now and what happened last season, it's almost similar fashion when the team needed help the manager failed them, do you believe that even next season we will be better than season? that's a question i want you to sincerely answer... if we lose the title please it has nothing to do with the quality of city it's purely of our own making.. i understand that people want to remain positive but let's be realistic why we are failing short and tackle our own demons i never thought we were going to win the league this season, which i have said many times. why do man.city win the league year after year and reach the semifinal or the final of cl almost every year. man.city is probably the best team of the world and they bought the best striker in the world to make them better, and he has already made goals for them this season. there's a reason why we haven't won the league since . the main reason is that other teams are better than us like it or not. yes, i believe that we will be a top team next season as well, what we have will be better next season. last season we finished the season with points, now we have and still five games left. well it's your opinion and some valid point there too... one can also argue that it's not always about the players maybe city have the best manager in the world also, who make everything tik, personally i believe if gadiola managed our squad this season we would have won the league, everyone has been complaining about city's spending the truth is others like united and chelsea have spent equally as much. football every season is different with it's challenges that we finished point below city doesn't mean next season we win the league, doesn't even guarantee next season city will be the best team... liverpool pushed city for season's look at them this season, they can win it this season, i don't like predicting the future, we can prepare our best but others will equally prepare, these closed gap doesn't mean we are automatically disposed others as title contenders you can look at it in many direction. even if we have our best recruitment next season city will still probably have the better squad, this season what happened last season that ended our top hope repeated again, if city win the league eventually, how does that have to do with the quality of city? i believe we have a very good foundation and i'm optimistic about our future and this is my objective. let's finish the season before we are making any conclusions. how can you say we have a good foundation and be optimistic? according to the ""realists"" on ja we have bottled it, our captain is not good enough, our players are overrated, we have no plan b, we have failed this season, every other manager is more experienced and has better tactics. in fact, there really is no hope because this season is over, mc are better, mu are better and next year we have no chance again because everyone else is going to be better. it's been a terrible season and the future's bleak. @ gun down...life is not that complicated at all, people only make it hard to live in for themselves.. in real life if you don't like the way things are shaping out in your place of work and you've got no power to change things...the best thing is for you to look for another job... the same goes with supporting a club. if arsenal as a club or ateta are so useless to the extent that you're sad with our performance this year .. you're free to support man city the better club ... at least it's free to support any club ... it's normal to complain but it's annoying to keep repeating the same thing over and over when you can at least get your happiness from elsewhere.... where you able to achieve all your personal goals for this year even when you put in all your possible best ... that show's you that, what you thought to be ""your best"" might look like a ""your mistake"" to others ... life can definitely overrule any plan and hardwork ... at any time... i hope we get the two english players ornstein's touting. they're best of mates and look to be in need of ""a new challenge"", or whatever they call it these days. arteta is still learning on the job, and has almost completed his best season, and will get better, and the team along with him. we'll challenge again. this season has been quite a ride. nice saying jax :thumbs_up: yes. but the second place isn't guaranteed yet, because we still have to play against chelsea/ newcastle/ brighton and we will have two more games after that and one of those games after that is nottingham forest who beat liverpool the other day and drew with man city previously, walloped brighton last week. their lowly position doesn't seem to matter when they're at home. they will put in extra efforts if they still have a good chance to stay in epl liverpool beat forest - on the october forest beat liverpool at home -. it's their home form i was talking about. yes we have over achieved from what we have done the previous seasons where we have underachieved. like last season we have finished higher than the season before but also like last season, we have failed to take a opportunity. th last season was ours and we threw it away. st this season was ours and we threw it away. now i hear some people say, dont get gready!!!!! well i am not gready just a little worried about the soft under belly that still exists. there are reasons why we have capitulated this season and it was not due to injuries ( all though they dont help ) it was due to the way we cant sustain our form under pressure. our set up is flimsy and the way the manager and players handle it is not very inspiring. well done for second but lets not get all gushy. why are we saying overachieving, please let's be realistic a season that saw chelsea and liverpool spend most of their season mid table, a season that united are rd or th playing in two cup finals with a manager in his first season at united, a season that saw newcastle probably ending in top , outside city and wobbling liverpool with aging squad we and city are the most stable club currently, mind u even in the mist of all these we are probably ending trophyless, knocked out at both cups at earliest possible, just made it past the europa group stage and sent home... the truth is if city were to win the league then it's a big missed opportunity, i can't see many top clubs dropping this low next season take a look at the whole picture and tell me where arsenal would have finished and be see as progress, below united and newcastle who finished last season below us and who have managers that is less than two years and one year with their clubs respectively. arsenal title challenge this season is not over. chelsea is next. our dip at a crucial time was a combination of factors imho. . lack of proper rotation. no need to reshuffle starting , start or different players while starting one's in form. . injuries to key players at critical times. . not dropping players out of form . no plan b or change in approach or play when the team is clearly struggling. . players can't dig themselves out of a crisis, and our leaders aren't leading when the team falters. still a lot of work to be done next year. the mental aspect still an issue, and a plan b when things go sideways. can't approach every game with the same tactics, even pep and klopp change things up when needed. yes, we haven't closed the tremendous gap but it's definitely decreasing. we are lacking squad depth and haven't the best squad either, but we are moving in the right direction. well dp, there are plenty who will disagree that we haven't got squad depth. i don't think we have squad depth or sufficient quality from those who are fit. it is overlooked that tomi has a long term injury. right now we lack squad depth but by august it will be stronger surely! well said @ durand. total agreement with you. squad depth is a myth!!!!! and a poor excuse. the last four games, the only first team regular missing was saliba. if we are that flimsy then we will never win anything. one player out does not allow squad depth to be a valid excuse. it is a poor excuse and not the reason. i avoided saying this because i knew people will attack me, people saying injuries makes me laugh maybe i will make an article about our struggles but maybe that too will be seen as a negative article it probably will be (seen as negative), but a fully fit top-quality squad is obviously key to success over the whole season. that's your opinion and not mine. do guardiola share your opinion :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: no didrik, its fact, saliba is the only first team player missing these last four games and we have had a healthy bench in all areas. unlike you reggie, i didn't think arsenal could go the whole season without a dip in form. saliba has been one of arsenal's best players this season and among the league's best centre-backs. his importance to the team is highlighted by how many goals arsenal conceded on average before and after he was injured. i don't think saliba's absence is the whole reason, but our defense has definitely become more vulnerable during his absence. yes it has nobody is denying that. the problem is, are we so finely tuned that one little piece goes missing andxwe collapse? or have we got no plan b, or are we so flimsy one piece missing, its good night irene. because that has what has happened. the squad is still in good shape, the team not so. we aren't good enough and we have never achieved points during a season. man.city has achieved points several times, and when you need points+ to win the league you can't make many mistakes. we have had a tremendous epl season and has almost closed the points gap between our clubs. i'm optimistic about our future and i believe we will get better next season. coyg dp, agree, but the problem for next season is that liverpool and chelsea can't be as poor as they were this season, newcastle united, manchester united and aston villa are on an upward trend, with good managers and have owners willing and able to spend, while clubs like tottenham hotspurs, brighton & hove albion, brentford and fulham will be more than nuisance value. next season should be very competitive for the champions league places and arsenal will have the added demands of competing in europe, plus hopefully greater attention to the domestic cups. i don't worry about next season i believe we will get better become a regular top club again. if we are second best this season we should aim for the title next season. just think about the journey we have had last three years... there could yet be a twist in this season, as city have two potential trip-ups for their final games. unpredictable brentford and wonderful bha may be our saviours yet. it's not over as long as we do not drop any more points, but i'm sure the players are quite aware of this. are you guys not tired of this? we are out of all competition and wobbling, we keep predicting city have this, they play that and are in fa cup final and semi finals of the ucl, we play a game every week and look so jaded still.. agree gd, we are out of form and city are bang in form. where do these people think this massive turn around is going to come. and same people saliba is still out so your theories make no sense. winning by stretching rules or using lawyers to find weaknesses in uefa's financial fair play regulations. football has become a dirty business and man.city should have been stopped long time ago. agree dp, but money talks with football; you only have to look at the track record of the english fa and fifa (look no further than the award of the world cup to qatar). as for manchester city, a serial offender under ffp, financial penalties are a joke and just gift money to the governing bodies, while loss of points, relegations etc are a pipe dream. yaa your right it's not over ,let win all the games and we see while we have improved from last season ,it will seem like a waste if we do not go on to win the league having been points clear ,also while we have improved other teams have been awful this season that won't be the case next season and i feel we may have missed our chance if we come second . half a billion spent on players we should be seeing improvement anyway ,so to say we have overachieved is an overstatement imo . pts clear with plenty of games to play against city was nothing! we all knew that they could win on the bounce playing in third gear. amazing job managing to get that lead in the first place. i'd be disappointed if another team caught us, but not city. even an amazing liverpool team over a / year period could only finish above city once. straight to the point, good reading, jen. but you skirt over the fact we should have took - points from games that we should have won (liverpool being the exception) .you have to remember that city have their eyes on the big one and have been playing midweek also ,while we went out of el against a really poor team so there was no excuse not to beat southampton and west ham imo ,while it's great we have put up a fight this season it also stinks of last season when we completely folded when top was so easy to get . if we finish second it will be on par with the bottle job from last season ,let's see how long the owners put up with that after so much expenditure,he will get next season no doubt but there won't be anywhere to hide from him or the excuses that arise so often reagarding his tenure here thus far . let's hope city take their eye off the ball and we somehow go on to take the title . do you believe that arsenal started the season and considered themselves title contenders? did you expect arsenal to play league games without dip in form? i never expected us to win the league because we haven't the best first eleven or squad. i felt sad in five minutes time, but realised that arsenal can never compete with a shady club stretching uefa's financial fair play regulations. football have become a dirty business and i hope arsenal never will be like man.city. coyg :thumbs_up: dan, draws, plus loss to everton were critical. it's beyond me anyway that the tone has changed. well pointed out that we have done so well to be where we are. the minute there is a downturn arteta is to blame. weak mentality. no rotation. bottlers and so on but excuses are made for every team who are below us for being out of sorts and who will be better than us next season. . this is a regular football season like all seasons when anything can happen... except that at the moment our arch rivals right now have almost been in a class of their own for / years well ofc arteta is to blame just as emery and wenger before him were too ,i don't get you're point sue . yes we have improved but there was absolutely no excuse to lose so many points in the last games ,i've been right behind arteta and the team all season but i will call out this manager and team when i believe they have let us down ,which they have . would be nice to get out of moderation pat ,maybe blame old jonny boy for my outburst last weekend ,out of sort by me but had a bad week personally . but i won't stand crap from him or anyone else . sorry dan. you are both in moderation till th may. i can't wake up to crap like that. i need a rest well i come back on the th may then it's funny how you keep complaining that there's no excuse for dropping so many points over the last games (arsenal's only genuine bad run so far by the way), yet there's no realisation and acknowledgement that arteta had done a phenomenal job getting us into that position prior to the liverpool game in the first place. for some bizarre reason, you're defining arteta's season on these games and ignoring the insanely good job he did in the first games. he's made mistakes for sure over the last few games, but it's not his fault what ramsdale doing what he did against southampton, or saka missing a crucial pen. stop being so negative all the time, and focus on the huge progression we've made. jen, we have progressed but we should have won it. i didn't believe we could, until the day we lost - at home to city. that might sound strange, but we only went down because two of our players gifted it to city on a plate. we were better than them initially in that game and that actually gave me confidence because i thought (maybe naively) that we would learn from those mistakes. unfortunately we didn't. we have no discipline at the back and sometimes in midfield. that title was there for the taking. the cup was screaming at us to take it home, but we ignored it. the loss of concentration for those games was hugely disappointing dk and virtually ensured the title would slip away from us as i couldn't envisage us beating city after that im just frustrated at the level of blame that has been bandied about after what has been a very good season so far. perhaps it's my ever advancing years that allows me to be more able to take the rough with the smooth and not blow a fuse if the wheel falls off - hopefully temporarily in this case. of course i want arsenal to be numero uno. i still think arteta and the team are evolving but are clearly not at the level of pg and his players and the depth of talent that sits on the bench. would maureen have blown it from our position, no. he would have parked the bus, played in defence or done what he could to have ground out a draw at city. we didn't even park our bike!!!!! would he have gotten us to the lead in the first place. not very likely! his record says yes!! whether you chose to accept it or not arteta is the major reason we might not win the league this season and i bet his favoritism is causing problems behind the scenes. nonsense, man.city is better than us and have been better than us for many years. in addition do they have a better first eleven and squad than us. how often has arsenal achieved points during a season? whatever you think about arteta, man.city won both their games against us and will finish their season with more points than us. it's sad that football is a game run by shady people. we lost the league in the three games previous to the city game. city to us this season should have been irrelevant. we had it and blew it. nothing to do with city. we lost the league because one team is better than us and won both games against us. in addition are they able to achieve + points year after year. we have almost closed the tremendous gap between our clubs, but to finish the league above man.city, and all their famous lawyers are almost impossible. didrik, it's not impossible. it was extremely possible at one point this season. when we went - up at anfield it looked very possible. it's our own fault. if we had the defensive solidity of newcastle we would have won the league..... and easily. even a club like newcastle for instance, haven't got a solid defence because of money, it's because their manager and his team coached their players to defend properly. we on the other hand were too helter-skelter at the back and sometimes in midfield. too many unessary topsy-turvey performances against vastly inferior teams shows that we were not solid enough defensively. both games against city didnt matter, it was the points against the likes of everton, southampton and west ham, that lost us the league, the city game would have been a free hit. the year leicester won the league, they lost to the second team twice that season, us. let's win it next season, but we need to create positive energy around the club :red_circle: :thumbs_up:reggie, so near but no cigar. :face_with_rolling_eyes: so no responsibility from arteta for getting us into that amazing position in the first place then? we must have had a different manager up until the liverpool game then! agree jen, one has to be evenhanded in assessing mickel arteta's management, as he has got a lot right. damn arsenal supporters are negative some damn arsenal supporters are too positive. one can only be positive about this season because we've massively overachieved. imagine a team like qpr getting to an fa cup final, but losing to a team like liverpool or utd in the final, then your own fans calling the players and manager out as bottlers. disgusting! cant say ive seen those words. no one can predict what will happen to underperforming big teams this season when it comes to next season because, last season when we missed top , i remember we are all tipping many big teams to be contenders ahead of us which will make it more harder for arsenal this season to qualify for champions league. but what happened at last ? who would have predicted such a bad season for liverpool, chelsea, even tottenham. we expect them to be contenders the way they finished last season. (especially the way chelsea splash out cash to buy players). but reverse is the case.... so in my opinion. arsenal have gone beyond many expectations this season. therefore, no one can predict what will happen next season as well. all we should hope for is a smart transfer window and far better season for our beloved club next season. coyg. totally agree with you, we should focus on ourselves and what we can influence. is it possible for this team to get better next season? absolutely. how many thought it was possible for arsenal to be title contenders two years ago :red_circle: ",moussa diaby,en,2023-05-01T08:30:00Z

"with the title race over, arteta and his boys set to finish second, can we look forward to what the summer awaits for the gunners? a few weeks ago, a report showed that arteta had a -man summer wish list. in that list, bayer leverkusen winger mousa diaby was featured. there was a suggestion that arteta sees diaby as the perfect alternative to bukayo saka. over the last few seasons, saka has been relied on for the right wing; with no one available to challenge him for that spot the -year-old has delivered, but at times fatigue has held him back. with champions league football back in the emirates, arteta needs saka to be fresh, and for that to be so, he needs to rest occasionally. there needs to be a reliable deputy for saka, and diaby could be that. so what are the chances diaby moves to the emirates? -- afcstuff (@afcstuff) may , daniel o calling all arsenal fans! anyone who would like to contribute an article or video opinion piece on justarsenal, please contact us through this link... arsenal and anyone concerned should not be talking of back ups. thats part of the problem and why we are becoming ""backups"" spot on. one of our biggest problems this season was that the manager didn't seem to trust that we could win without saka and certain other players. that's one of city's strengths - you can't be certain if grealish will start, or mahrez, or alvarez or even de bruyne, so it's harder to set up against them. it also means they can sub first team players into the game if they need to change it. we need a pool of first team players, not a starting and backups. bowen ,quality player and could be as good as saka if playing in a better team . as for diaby ,no thanks he would be another pepe who imo is better . i think samuel chukwueze is a perfect back up for bukayo i honestly agree we should stop thinking about back ups as we've always treated them as such, believing or arteta always thinking ""they aren't ready"". arsenal should buy a player that can challenge saka for that position and as such bring competition and rotation to bear. if we want to challenge man city, we should buy like man city. quality players of equal strength and value. if we buy to improve our squad, we must learn to use the players, not only as spare tyres. we buy backups and then people complain, the backups are not good enough when the starter is out. what do people expect. if we do buy backups, which i would hope we dont, then we will always struggle. the engine room of a team is the central midfield and the fullbacks. arsenal need energetic athlete players in those positions which was lacking towards the end of this season. so caicedo and rice are perfect options and one quality energetic flexible full back that can play across the back four. i would use tossard as a permanent no first option started and have jesus and saka rotate on the right. tossard should only play as number not as a singer because he lacks the pace but he is creative and intelligent and has close ball control to be an excellent false number . i would promote tierney to rotate with martinelli on the left because they can both carry the ball with energy with martinelli more of a drbbler and tierney more of a crosser of the ball which we lack sometimes. sak a fan also cross the ball better from the left side so he needs to switch wings during the game sometimes to both provide crossed and shake off the double marking which he can't seem to beat. get a top striker who can deliver goals. jesus can compete with saka for rw. all the years with man city and this year with us have shown jesus is not a striker to lead the attack. he has proved himself and arteta wrong. he isnt a striker, pep knew that and is rubbing his hands with glee. durand true said bro, with our pacey wingers we need a center forward, which jesus is not. we need balogun back next season, and make additions to the midfield, defense and forwards. the we are good to go and compete for both the league and champions league. we are still hurting not winning the league. use one stone and kill two birds by bringing in an attack bully as in vlohovic leaving jesus and saka to compete on the right never mind back ups .the need for a stronger c.f has been evident since jesus returned from injury as he has been distinctly average at best imo.many well known central strikers have been mentioned in despatches and most would cost upwards of m.bearing in mind the need for quality recruits in central midfield, our budget is unlikely to extend to a high cost cf.however there is a young central striker currently playing for coventry city who may well be available for nearer m.i refer to victor gyokeres, the young swedish international.i have seen him on occasions this season and he has impressed me and many professional pundits.at ''' "" he is physically powerful and adept at holding up the ball. while he is not a flier, he makes great runs between the lines and is a good finisher.he is a handful in the championship and while he may find it more difficult in the premier league we should not lose sight of the fact that the likes of toney and watkins served their apprenticeship in the lower division and have gone on to do very well at a higher level. grandad, i watched that swedish striker the other night and totally agree with you. he looks a right handful. i always like hearing your recommendations - i hadn't heard of this player, but he looks interesting. one player i'm interested to know about is chuba akpom - he's had a fantastic season from the looks of it. have you had a chance to catch any of his games? i'm wondering if he's finally blooming and if you think he would be useful back at arsenal? i gues leo of ac milan could couilddo a lot in my own opinion although i like the look of kulusevki, i would go for bowen, as i would say with bowen there's more end product. yes davi i've seen akpom a few times for middlesborough and while he has done well, i think gyokeres is better.i also agree with hd and others on ja who appreciate bowen .he must be one of the hardest workers in the epl with great attitude and skill and he can finish.a cut above trossard imo. thanks for the reply - i have no idea, but it would be nice to bring back one of our former youth players. has to be at the level though!

"the uefa europa league final in budapest won't simply provide the opportunity to lift international silverware for italian side roma, who last night knocked out germany's bayer leverkusen in a hard-fought semifinal return leg. last night, both uefa europa league semifinals were packed with drama. at ramon sanchez pizjuan stadium, sevilla and juventus offered a very entertaining first half, featuring clear goal-scoring opportunities on both ends. the bianconeri probably had the biggest chance with fifa world cup champion angel di maria, who surprisingly missed the target from close range with an outside foot effort. substitute dusan vlahovic finally broke the deadlock in the th minute, just a few seconds after he stepped on the pitch. the serbia international showcased all his composure in front of goal when he beat sevilla's goalkeeper with a gentle, left-footed chip that gave his side the - lead. supported by , loud fans, sevilla immediately found the strength to come back from the disadvantage. the spanish side took six minutes to equalize the score, courtesy of former ac milan attacking midfielder suso, who fired from distance into the top-left corner. in what remained a very balanced match throughout all minutes, the tie was eventually broken in extra time. an erik lamela's header, which was too carefully placed to be within juventus goalkeeper wojciech szczesny's reach, was enough to hand sevilla a ticket to their fifth uefa europa league final in years. roma, who started on a - aggregate following a goal in the first leg by italian youngster edoardo bove, traveled to germany knowing that a tie against bayer leverkusen would suffice. the giallorossi lined up in a very organized -- system, channeling their energy on containing the opponent's attacks rather than bringing numbers forward. across the two halves, jose mourinho's men conceded a total of shots to xabi alonso's side, but they never lost composure and diligently stuck to their defensive game plan until the final whistle. their efforts eventually paid off: after nine, seemingly eternal minutes of added time, the roma players could finally scream in joy for having clinched their second european final in two years and their first uefa europa league final since . reserving a spot in the uefa champions league has proven particularly challenging this year for serie a clubs, as six of them are fiercely fighting for three available slots with only three league rounds to spare. on may , roma are scheduled to take the field against sevilla at budapest's puskas arena, but there is already great anticipation in rome among the giallorossi fans. jose mourinho's men are ready to battle it out in a game that will define their current season as well as shape the fate of the upcoming one.

""it's a good base to build on, but the standards have to go up, the demands have to rise,"" he said. ""we have to work in the summer with this squad, but also in the window. see if you can strengthen the squad. ""now we are far away so we have a lot of work to do. we make progress in this team in this squad, but we need better players if we want to compete for the highest."" united was too good for chelsea on thursday. needing a point from its final two games to secure qualification to the champions league, it went ahead in the sixth minute when casemiro headed in christian eriksen's free kick. martial doubled united's lead in first-half stoppage time and fernandes added a third from the penalty spot in the rd after being brought down by wesley fofana. it got worse for fofana and chelsea when the defender's misplaced pass was seized on and substitute rashford added a fourth five minutes later. another substitute alejandro garnacho hit the bar late on as united went in search of another. chelsea substitute joao felix scored a consolation in the th, but it was another miserable night for the londoners, who have now lost eight of their games under interim manager frank lampard.
